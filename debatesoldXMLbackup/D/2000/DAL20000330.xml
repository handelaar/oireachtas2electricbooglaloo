      <P>It is proposed to take No. 16, motion re report of the Committee of Public Accounts &ndash; Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT, first report. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and of the main spokespersons for the Government and the Labour Party shall be called upon in that order and shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case. The speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case. The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts shall be called upon not later than 4.35 p.m. to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach anything to tell the House this morning about progress in resolving the current transport chaos?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, on his visit to Egypt next week, be the only Dubliner travelling in the remaining form of public transport available or will the Government invoke any of the consultative processes available to it, such as the Public Transport Partnership Forum, as set out in the recently agreed programme, or alternatively does the Government intend to convene an emergency meeting of the central review committee of social partnership to see what progress can be made to achieve a satisfactory resolution of this chaos?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann management and senior SIPTU officials held discussions through most of last night and into the early hours of the morning. These discussions will continue today at 11 o'clock &ndash; they will start in <Col N="262" /> about 25 minutes &ndash; with a view to ending the unofficial strike and enabling the negotiations on the substantive issues to get under way. Pickets have been placed today on a number of depots and there are still difficulties with services but many of the other services are operating normally today. When the unofficial action is ended, I hope later today, there still will be some disruption because all the tracks have to be inspected. I hope that will happen throughout the day.</P>
      <P>On the Dublin Bus strike, the Government's position remains unchanged. Agreement is possible provided its basis is genuine productivity and restructuring measures. The negotiations that took place on that matter had the capacity to lead to agreement and if they were resumed within the normal industrial relations machinery, they would prove successful. Proposals by the company and the NRBU in that regard can provide a basis for the resumption of the negotiations and the Government hopes that at an early time they will take that course because it is the only course that will resolve this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the people who are suffering most from the current traffic chaos are the most vulnerable sections of our community, people who cannot get to hospital, who have no car of their own and are isolated as a result of the strike. Is the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister responsible for the industrial relations machinery of the State, taking steps to ensure that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which is the guarantor on the union side of the partnership agreement, is using its good offices, along with her, to find a resolution to this in the interests of the most vulnerable sections of our community who are suffering while others are merely being slightly inconvenienced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify what he has just said? Do I understand him correctly to have said that as far as the Government is concerned there is now the basis of a possible solution and settlement consequently between the NRBU and CIE? If that is the case why can the negotiations not commence immediately? The unofficial strike relating to the rail matter does not affect the NRBU and the Dublin Bus dispute. Am I correct in my understanding that within the framework of the PPF the basis of a solution is now in sight? If that is the case can that not be pursued vigorously with the help of congress, if necessary, or the institutions of the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken about the unofficial action and I acknowledge the efforts being made by Iarnróid Éireann management, senior SIPTU officials as well as the Minister and officials of the Department of Public Enterprise. On the separate matter of the Dublin Bus strike, to reiterate what the Minister has been saying for days, we believe agreement is possible. As always, the labour relations mechanisms of the State are available. The Minister has outlined how there can be a resolution time and again and everyone is available at all times, as she outlined in response to two Special Notice Questions and a debate under Standing Order 31 in the past week. I hope people take account of what she has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is work-related. The day before yesterday the Government announced a system of work permits for non-EU citizens to come to Ireland. Have any regulations been drawn up on this? One of his Ministers seemed to imply that new legislation was not needed. What are the mechanics of the system that will enable those who need workers to get permits? Has any system been put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work permit legislation is due at the end of the year. As I said on Tuesday, to make the necessary changes the Tánaiste will have to extend what is an <i>ad hoc </i>system. The <Col N="264" /> whole matter will, however, be the subject of legislation at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is any legislation planned to deal with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? People not only need a work visa but they need a visa from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enter the country. Are the two Ministers working together to ensure that people will not be refused permission because they do not have an entry visa even if one of the Ministers has organised his or her end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Visas will apply to the workers but their families will be refused entry by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is the current regime and it is totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>On legislation intended to amend the 1932 Transport Act, is it true this legislation will not come before the House until the NRBU accepts competition as part of the productivity deal and restructuring measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a correct interpretation. As the Minister for Public Enterprise has outlined, there will be discussions of that legislation and other matters. There are no preconditions as to when it will come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts &ndash; Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT, First Report &ndash; Examination of the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into the Administration of Deposit Interest Retention Tax and Related Matters during the period 1 January 1986 to 1 December 1998.</P>
      <P>It is just over three months since the Committee of Public Accounts issued its first report arising from its parliamentary inquiry into DIRT. It is now time to check against the report to see what progress has been made on its recommendations. Before embarking on that process, I remind the House that the inquiry has not concluded and is merely suspended. Hearings will resume on Tuesday, 20 June 2000 to further review the progress made and to see what further steps, if any, require to be taken. As also indicated in the report of the inquiry, it will again resume in the first week of December 2000. Thus, clear deadlines have been set for the relevant Departments and agencies to report back to the committee. This follows the procedure followed by the Committee of Public Accounts since I first became its chairman in 1993. It has added greatly to the effectiveness of the committee as it ensures that its recommendations and decisions are not ignored, delayed or forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This parliamentary inquiry, the first of its kind, is a milestone in parliamentary procedure and work for a number of reasons and has inevitable consequences for the future of parliamentary organisation. The committee was seized of the issue for 14 months in total, which included ten months of preparation and two months writing the report, following 26 days of public hearings over six weeks. The background work and intense preparation for the inquiry allowed the efficient discharge of public business. Detailed procedural, logistical and legislative preparation was the key to permitting the inquiry to be completed speedily, economically and efficiently. However, I was <Col N="268" /> also required to be a firm and totally focused chairman who would not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer or brook any avoidable delays from any quarter. I apologise if I offended anybody in the process but it was absolutely necessary in the public interest. Another important fact is that the committee received widespread co-operation from public agencies and the financial institutions, and most especially, from the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance. I pay particular tribute, once again, to the clerk and staff of the Committee of Public Accounts whose diligent, tireless work over long hours and months were, in respect of each member of the staff, beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>When the committee was first seized of the DIRT issue in October 1998, it became immediately apparent to it that its powers were insufficient to permit it to undertake a full investigation of the issues involved. Within one week of hearing the Revenue case and the AIB case, the committee adopted a memorandum I submitted to it and that day sent an interim report to the Dáil detailing the procedural and legislative changes which were necessary to permit it to undertake and successfully complete a parliamentary inquiry. This interim report proposed, <i>inter alia</i>, that a previously unused vehicle provided in section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923 be used whereby, by resolution of Dáil Éireann, the Comptroller and Auditor General could be requested to undertake specified work on behalf of the Dáil. The Comptroller and Auditor General and his office embraced this considerable burden willingly and undertook it with the effectiveness and diligence which have been a hallmark of the office for many years.</P>
    <P>All the legislative changes were enacted within eight weeks in the Comptroller and Auditor General and Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Special Provisions) Act, 1998 which was signed by the President during Christmas week and which permitted the Comptroller and Auditor General to commence his investigation immediately after Christmas.</P>
    <P>The advantages of an initial investigation was that the Comptroller and Auditor General was asked, in effect, to compile a book of evidence by interviewing potential witnesses under oath in private. The wisdom of the committee's decision has been borne out by the speed with which this initial stage was concluded.</P>
    <P>Central to the findings of the DIRT inquiry are that major and urgent changes are required in the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank, external auditors, the financial institutions and, in particular, the Oireachtas itself. Some structural management and information system reform is needed in the Department of Finance and this reform should be a model for other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Revenue Commissioners, it should be acknowledged that significant administrative changes had already recently been introduced. However, more fundamental change is <Col N="269" /> required and ideally this should be legislated for in a new consolidated Revenue Act. Among other things, such an Act could address the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to prosecute tax evaders and provide for stiffer penalties, including imprisonment, for such illegal activities; provide for the streamlining of the appeals procedure making it more transparent and accountable; and provide for a statutory Revenue board which ideally should include a number of carefully selected non-executive Revenue Commissioners from outside the Revenue itself.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has also been criticised in the report and rightly so. It has been subject to other criticisms, especially in the consumer protection area in the past year or two, to the extent that its future role is in question. As valid as the criticisms are, the Central Bank must have a continuing central role in governing the financial sector and this should include the consumer protection role as well. It appears to me that to have a financial regulator separate to the Central Bank would be to attempt to divide the indivisible. The continuing stability of the financial institutions is vital to the national interest but this does not excuse, or permit, that a blind eye be turned to illegality or poor customer service. Reforms of the Central Bank should be capable of addressing these issues. The practice whereby the Governor of the Central Bank is always a former secretary-general or second secretary-general of the Department of Finance has unwittingly blurred the independence of action and thinking which is such a vital part of the bank's role. This practice should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The role of the external auditors came under the spotlight in this inquiry and the revelations were not impressive. The committee welcomes the fact that a review group has been established to consider the issues raised by the committee and looks forward to receiving its recommendations in the near future. While the remit of the inquiry was to consider the DIRT issue and the financial institutions, it seems clear to me that the deficiencies disclosed regarding external auditors almost certainly can be extrapolated to embrace the role of external auditors across industry as a whole and this should be taken into account in the review group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have noted the recent public comments which emerged from the International Financial Services Centre and the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have met representatives of the financial institutions operating there to discuss their concerns. Concerns have also been expressed by financial institutions operating outside the IFSC particularly in regard to the following: that the Revenue may take minor and irrelevant omissions in the documentation covering non-resident accounts as a breach of the law; and that the time lag in coming to an assessment of liability for unpaid taxes, penalties and interests is like a sword of Damocles hanging over those institutions with some attendant dangers. I am confi<Col N="270" /> dent the Revenue Commissioners are undertaking the task sensibly and sensitively.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Revenue recently finalised a protocol identifying those minor documentary errors or omissions which could not have led to tax foregone. I understand these will be excluded from any assessment of liability. I am also confident the Revenue Commissioners are working flat out, in what is a major undertaking, to finalise assessments as speedily as possible. The committee set clear deadlines for this so as to minimise uncertainty. Having discussed this matter with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners I have every confidence the deadlines will be met in most cases and, in some cases, earlier settlements may be possible. However, the speedy conclusion of this process also depends on the full blooded co-operation of the financial institutions and I am glad to note this has been generally the case so far. The Revenue Commissioners will, I have no doubt, act sensibly, and they can use their powers to reach settlements which appear to them to be reasonable. While the experience of the committee suggests that many will act reasonably, it is not clear to me that good sense prevails everywhere in the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Government has apparently been advised that the suggested levy on the financial institutions could give rise to constitutional difficulties. Even so, an act of reparation on the part of the financial institutions would still be appropriate and would do much to restore public confidence in institutions in which confidence is such a vital necessity. There are many great causes in our society which could do with help, especially among the poor and the disabled. These groups are also least likely to be party to bogus non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>The financial institutions are perceived to have conspired with corrupt tax evasion and have been branded as corrupt. This is too simplistic. I have already indicated my belief that the deeds and omissions of the financial institutions, and the tens of thousands of citizens who, it must be recalled, established bogus non-resident accounts, were the product of laxity by the public authorities rather than endemic corruption. If this analysis is correct I see much better prospects for the future. However, the reality is that tens of thousands of citizens evaded taxes and getting to these sources will represent the greatest difficulty for the Revenue Commissioners. It remains to be seen how far the Revenue Commissioners can go in pursuing so many individual tax evaders especially with the elapse of time and considerations arising therefrom. The example in the Milltown Malbay case must be borne in mind, where a considerable sum of DIRT evaded was retrieved, but yet it only represented one tenth of total tax evaded and subsequently retrieved. It is the committee's hope that in the June review, the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to clarify how it proposes to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The only part of the report of the inquiry which <Col N="271" /> has been subjected to significant criticism is the section relating to former Ministers for Finance. It should be absolutely clear that, in relation to the financial sector, the buck stops at the desk of the Minister for Finance. That fact is obvious and its declaration does not require the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry. The report makes several criticisms of Ministers. However, none of the media criticisms indicated evidence which the committee's findings either ignored or controverted. The criticisms seemed to suggest that the committee should have come to conclusions at variance with the evidence. Having a go at Ministers and politicians generally, regardless of the facts, may be acceptable to some journalists but a sworn inquiry of this nature had a duty to be fair and to have regard only to the facts. However, overwhelmingly the reportage and analysis of both the hearings and the report were comprehensive and fair. I thank the media for that and especially TG4 for covering the hearings live, which played a major part in the success of the inquiry. Media coverage is vitally important to the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas, its committees and future parliamentary inquiries.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in this year's Finance Act comprehensively cover the proposals made in the report regarding Revenue's duties and powers regarding a look-back audit since 1986 of all the financial institutions. I thank the Minister for his speedy and full response. The post of parliamentary legal adviser has already been advertised but at a salary level which does not approximate to the importance of the proposed post. A working group has been established in the Department of Finance to oversee the speedy implementation of the report's recommendations. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also acted quickly in establishing the review group on external auditors which was proposed in the report. The committee hopes that under each of the above headings significant progress will have been made by 20 June next when the sub-committee resumes and that complete progress will be reported when the sub-committee resumes again in early December 2000. I hope the Minister will indicate the Government's stance on each of the recommendations of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>A fundamental and central part of the inquiry's recommendations is a comprehensive reform of the Oireachtas. This is based on the finding of the inquiry that weaknesses in accountability regarding Oireachtas resources, structures and procedures, were a common contributory factor to all recent scandals. The inquiry will be a failure if its recommendations on Oireachtas reform are not implemented. The Dáil is crying out for modernisation and reform. Yet, I am unaware of any progress on this matter. That fact in itself underlines the parliamentary inertia of which the report so rightly complains and blames.</P>
    <P>Whether it will be feasible to establish many parliamentary inquiries in the future depends <Col N="272" /> very much on Oireachtas reform. This includes ensuring the proposed office of parliamentary law adviser is appropriately resourced. It also depends on legislation creating the position of parliamentary inspector with appropriate powers and functions which the sub-committee suggests should approximate to those of a High Court inspector. The report points out that a parliamentary inquiry made up of politicians would never be an appropriate forum to inquire into matters that are essentially political. Therefore, parliamentary inquiries can never fully replace tribunals of inquiry. However, there is, rightly, considerable public disquiet at both the length and cost of some tribunals. Clearly, one possible factor is that counsel and other legal representatives are paid daily rates. This creates the perception that participants have a vested interest in prolonging the inquiry. This perception, together with the very high fixed daily rates, becomes as much a scandal as the original subject of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The DIRT report calls on the Attorney General to undertake a comparative study of parliamentary inquiries and tribunals to see if any lessons are to be learned. There is a strong case for abolishing daily rates for both tribunals and inquiries, instead providing, for example, a schedule of retainer fees which would be drawn up in a way that addresses this problem. Moreover, the question arises as to whether the practice of tribunals of taking one witness at a time is the most efficient way of conducting its business. Certainly, in the DIRT inquiry, building on the normal practice of the Committee of Public Accounts, the taking of groups of witnesses together greatly contributed to the speed of the inquiry. The atmosphere of a round table approach is intrinsically less adversarial than the witness box format which can be confused with a court dock. The avoidance of an adversarial format can contribute enormously to the speed of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The advance work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts suggests that a similar format may, in future, be considered for tribunals, with an inspector appointed to seek out the relevant information in private and to report to the tribunal before its public hearings begin. It is also worthy of consideration as to whether any future inquiry should be constituted by a sole member. A multi-member format could offer scope for a wider extra expertise other than just legal expertise to be brought to bear and provide an in-built corrective mechanism against delays or the adoption of the hours of sittings of courts rather than hours and days more appropriate to an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In making these comments I make no judgment about the respective merits of tribunals or parliamentary inquiries. However, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I consider it my duty to raise concerns about costs that are not controllable by the Oireachtas but yet fall to be paid by the Exchequer. It is my hope that the Attorney General may be in a position to submit <Col N="273" /> his comments to the sub-committee before its June review.</P>
    <P>When the DIRT report was published I indicated that the cost to the sub-committee would be in the region of £800,000, including staff overtime but not including ordinary Oireachtas staff costs which would have been incurred in any event. I am now in a position to confirm a final figure of £823,393. Included in this figure is a provision of £239,388 for IT equipment and digital recording which will continue to be available to the Oireachtas henceforth and will be of enormous benefit. In reality, that cost should not be attributed fully to the inquiry. This equipment proved invaluable to the inquiry and was the subject of public comment and many inquiries from outside. Full credit is due to the clerk of the committee who designated the requirement and requisitioned it on behalf of the committee.</P>
    <P>The total legal costs of the committee for three senior counsel and two junior counsel amounted to £208,685. The costs of the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigations on behalf of the Dáil are understood to be under £1 million. Therefore, the total cost of the inquiry remains at approximately £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the committee, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for putting the entire resources of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the disposal of the committee and for making the arrangements he and the Clerk of the Dáil made. I cannot say too loudly how much I appreciate the enormous work done by the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas at every level. It was edifying, they rose to the occasion brilliantly and they deserve the thanks of the public. This relates in particular to the clerk and staff of the committee, the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerk of the Dáil. I also thank the other staff, including the Editor of Debates for the speed with which the transcripts were provided within an hour or an hour and a half of the word being spoken.</P>
    <P>There have been many innovations in the inquiry, including the full transcript of the inquiry and documents which are available on CD ROM. This is available for purchase in the Government Publications Sale Office. In addition, I thank the Minister for Finance for his wholehearted support, for the wholehearted support of his Department and for making the resources required available to the committee, including the appointment of personal assistants to each member of the sub-committee for the duration of the inquiry. That was money well spent and was invaluable. This will have to be replicated in future as an ongoing provision for some committees at least. I also thank our legal and financial advisers for their diligence and assistance.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words of thanks to my colleagues on the sub-committee who were unstinting in their commitment and co-operation with me. This was an important aspect of the inquiry, without which it would not have been possible to conclude the inquiry as speedily or effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The DIRT inquiry has been given widespread, even lavish, praise and approbation. While I am grateful for this, as are other members of the committee, it is premature for us to relax in a welter of favourable comment. Not until the recommendations are in force will the committee's work be completed in this matter. It is my hope that I will be able to return to the House in December and claim that a worthwhile public service has been completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue. I have already outlined at some length the Government's response to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts when I introduced the recent Finance Bill. This debate allows me to recap and elaborate on the important public policy issues raised by the DIRT inquiry.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, on 15 December 1999 the Committee of Public Accounts published its first report of the inquiry into the operation of deposit interest retention tax. It seems clear that deposit takers facilitated the evasion of DIRT through the establishment of bogus non-resident accounts. However, these accounts were also used by investors, in some cases at least, to conceal otherwise taxable income from the Revenue Commissioners. The issue first surfaced in the printed media in 1998 whereupon the Committee of Public Accounts commenced an investigation of the matter. The investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General was facilitated by resolution of Dáil Éireann. In addition, the legislative platform for the investigation includes the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, and the Comptroller and Auditor General and Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Special Provisions) Act, 1998. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was published in July 1999 and this was followed by the public hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee which ran from August to November of last year.</P>
      <P>Once again I wish to put on record my welcome for the report and my commendation of the sub-committee for conducting and concluding its deliberations in an efficient and expeditious manner. I am sure Deputies will agree that the cost effectiveness of the process is one of its more attractive features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report made a series of recommendations in relation to the following: the operation of the DIRT system by the Revenue Commissioners; a revenue Act to provide a modern framework for the Revenue Commissioners, to be preceded by a review of the Revenue; the powers available to Revenue in relation to audit; the publication by Revenue of details of certain tax cases; the role of external auditors; the operation of financial regulation and the role of the Central Bank; a possible contribution by, or levy on, the financial institutions concerned to fund socially desirable <Col N="275" /> and community investment schemes; the appropriation and application of dormant bank accounts for such purposes; the operation of the Oireachtas and future parliamentary inquiries; the role of Oireachtas committees; the accountability of chief executive officers of State bodies to Oireachtas committees; and, finally, the issue of conflict of interest where former civil servants take up outside employment. The Committee of Public Accounts asked for progress reports on certain of these recommendations within six months.</P>
    <P>In response to this report, I established a special group in my Department to examine the recommendations and findings. The work of the group is ongoing and a programme of action has been drawn up in relation to the recommendations of the report. The Attorney General has advised on the legality and constitutionality of some of the recommendations. The Finance Act, 2000, implements several of the recommendations of the report. I will outline these in more detail later in my statement. Work on the other recommendations is ongoing in my Department and other Departments and State agencies. The progress of these issues which may require action and-or input from my Department is being actively pursued by the specially established departmental group. I will deal with these issues first and outline their current position.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee made a number of recommendations which are designed to promote the highest standards of corporate governance, probity and transparency in the financial services industry. Both I and the Central Bank have welcomed these proposals. It is my intention that future financial services legislation will incorporate appropriate provisions based upon these recommendations. This will provide a firmer legal basis for the regulatory authorities to obtain assurances that the highest standards prevail in financial institutions in the areas of ethics, corporate governance, compliance and auditing.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I advise the House that the Central Bank has requested all credit institutions to submit their internal codes of ethical practice so that an assessment can be made as to whether further action is required. At European level, the Central Bank has recently taken the initiative to arrange for surveys of current practices in the areas of ethics in corporate governance with a view to assessing where domestic standards can be improved. The Central Bank has also amended its licensing and supervision requirements and standards by requesting that a report be provided to the boards of credit institutions at least annually on compliance with national and EU laws and international regulations. This report will,<i> inter alia, </i>cover issues related to supervisory, tax, consumer, company law and other compliance matters.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee further recommended that a scheme and procedure for bank officials to report suspected wrongdoing be introduced. I <Col N="276" /> understand that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be bringing forward proposals in this area in the near future. These are expected to take the form of amendments to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999, which was initiated in the Dáil last year as a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee also recommended that, as soon as is feasible, legislation be prepared so that the resources represented by funds in dormant accounts could be used for specified social and community purposes. Consideration of this issue is at an advanced stage. I hope to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly seeking approval in principle for a scheme requiring that the funds in dormant accounts in all financial institutions be transferred to the care of the State, subject to the right of the beneficial owner to seek a refund always being preserved. Subject to Cabinet approval, it is my intention to consult representatives of the financial services industry and the Central Bank and then to bring forward definitive legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee recommended that a detailed examination be undertaken by a review group in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in regard to auditing. The establishment of a review group was announced by the Tánaiste on 29 December. The group is to report by 31 May 2000. The terms of reference of the group correspond closely to the Committee of Public Accounts recommendation.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have made separate submissions to the group and are also participating directly in the group. Both submissions seek consideration for the involvement of a State agency in a system to provide for the independent supervision of auditors. They also propose that auditors should be required to certify that a company has complied with statutory provisions in the tax area. Such a requirement would represent the formalisation of existing practice in the auditing area.</P>
    <P>The centre for management and organisation development of my Department is currently carrying out the review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as recommended by the sub-committee. In particular the sub-committee suggested that the review should address the following issues: the independence and accountability of the office, including a review of its current legislative base; the office's organisation, structure and practices; and the desirability or otherwise of executive and non-executive commissioners on the board of Revenue.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the review will be completed within the timeframe set by the committee and work is being carried out on that basis. However, the scope of the review is broad and the six month timeframe may not be adequate to deal with all relevant issues in sufficient detail. In this event, it may be necessary to extend the review process beyond mid-year. I can assure the House that I am anxious that the review will be as thor<Col N="277" /> ough as possible and that it deals with all the issues raised.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the outcome of this review, I put on record again my acknowledgement of the progress made by Revenue for some years past, not only in streamlining processes but in modernising and opening up the organisation. This could have been recognised to a greater extent in the Committee of Public Accounts report. Nevertheless, it is timely to have a review as envisaged by the Committee of Public Accounts and I put on record that Revenue is co-operating fully with my officials in the work of this review. Revenue had undertaken a root and branch review of its organisation structure over the past few years, before the onset of the DIRT controversy. The extensive research undertaken by Revenue and the approach emerging from the deliberations of the Revenue board and management advisory committee has been made available to my Department and is a valuable input into the current review.</P>
    <P>The findings of the sub-committee in relation to ACC Bank were a matter of grave concern to me and I wrote to the chairperson on 21 December 1999 requiring a full response from the board, including the steps the board considers should be taken concerning the sub-committee's findings. The board responded on 28 January 2000. I intend to revert to the board on this once the results of the Revenue Commissioners full look-back audit are available.</P>
    <P>Pending this the reporting structures, which the sub-committee found had failed to keep the Minister for Finance informed of the deficiencies within ACC Bank, have been reviewed. Following this examination, new reporting arrangements have been established in the context of the concerns of the committee and of the need to address the future status of the ACC to ensure that both the Minister and the Department will be kept fully informed of all material matters within ACC. In addition to the reporting structures specified in the State bodies guidelines, I will meet the chairperson on at least a quarterly basis and there will also be quarterly briefings between the chief executive and officials of the Department. I will also meet the full board on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The ACC has also made operational changes to ensure respect for regulatory requirements. Many of these changes flow from the recommendations of the operational review of the bank carried out by KPMG in 1998. The changes include revised procedures in relation to the opening and operation of non-resident accounts and other exempt accounts and the appointment of a full-time compliance officer at a senior level in the bank. I am confident that the changes ACC has made, coupled with the new reporting structure, will ensure that this or any similar problem is addressed promptly in the future.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee report contained a recommendation that where Ministers are not accountable for the operational decisions of State com<Col N="278" /> panies, the chairman and chief executive of the company concerned should be amenable to the appropriate Oireachtas committee. The current accountability arrangements for State companies is based on a system of delegation to the board of general responsibility for operational matters and delegation by the board to executives of responsibility for detailed operational matters. In line with the sequence of delegation there is an appropriate sequence of accountability in the other direction, including to the relevant Minister who is accountable to the Oireachtas and, to the extent laid down by the Oireachtas, to other Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee has requested my Department to report back to the Committee of Public Accounts within six months on proposals to avoid any conflict of interest where officials leave the Civil Service for employment in the private sector. My Department, in conjunction with the human resources working group, has been drafting a code of conduct which will apply to all civil servants. Part of the draft code includes provisions which are aimed at avoiding a conflict of interest where officials leave the Civil Service for employment in the private sector. The draft code of conduct has been under consideration by the SMI implementation group which consists of a number of secretaries general of Departments. When this consultative process has been completed, I will bring the code of conduct to Government. I have given a commitment that the code will be circulated to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for consideration. Detailed discussions on the code will take place with the Civil Service unions in advance of finalisation. The latest position on those proposals will be set out in the report back to the Committee of Public Accounts in June.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee made a number of recommendations and findings relating to the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Oireachtas and its committee system generally. Examination of these matters is proceeding. Discussions are taking place with Oireachtas officials and also with the Attorney General's office. The preliminary legal view is that the recommendations in this regard can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the issue of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners. Following disclosures of tax evasion in recent years and the publication of the McCracken tribunal report in August 1997, I requested that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners review the adequacy of Revenue powers in the light of that report. While this review was wide-ranging, much of the focus was on powers of access to information held in financial institutions and measures relating to offshore transactions. Part of this process involved a detailed comparison of our powers in that regard with those in other jurisdictions. Arising from this process and well before the Committee of Public Accounts held its hearings and published its report on the DIRT issue, I had moved to strengthen substantially the powers of the Rev<Col N="279" /> enue Commissioners in respect of investigation work on financial institutions.</P>
    <P>As a result of provisions I included in the Finance Bill, 1999, which were then enacted into law, the Revenue Commissioners were provided with the following additional powers: an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners is now empowered to audit the DIRT returns of a relevant deposit taker, that is, banks etc. and the procedures applied by them in relation to non-resident declarations; the prohibition on an on-site audit of a financial institution was removed. Furthermore, an application can now be made to a judge of the District Court for the issue of a search warrant in relation to any premises; authorised officers have been given powers to issue a notice to a financial institution requiring it to make available for inspection books etc. or to furnish information relevant to a named person's tax liability. The new powers in this and other respects cover individuals and companies and extend to all relevant tax heads, not just income tax; an authorised officer is empowered to apply to the Appeal Commissioners for consent to issue a notice to a financial institution requiring it to make available for inspection books etc. or to furnish information relevant to a person's tax liability; an authorised officer can apply to a judge of the High Court for an order seeking from a financial institution access to books etc. or information relevant to a person's tax liability. Application can also be made by the authorised officer for an order of the court to freeze assets of a person in the custody of the financial institution; an authorised officer is empowered to apply to a judge of the Circuit Court or the District Court for an order authorising the officer to inspect and take copies of bank records for the purpose of investigating a Revenue offence.</P>
    <P>A number of the new powers I have cited here are contingent on an authorised officer first securing the consent of a revenue commissioner. Certain of them are aimed at persons claiming exemption from DIRT on the basis of non-residence in the State.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this and as a result of the Committee of Public Accounts report I included further provisions in the Finance Act, 2000. Section 68 of that Act empowers the Revenue Commissioners to appoint specially qualified persons to conduct or to assist with DIRT audits; to report to the Committee of Public Accounts before 1 November 2000 on the results of the DIRT &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; audit currently under way and to publish the results of this audit, including interim results, covering the years 1986-87 to 1998-99. The report to the Committee of Public Accounts is to set out the following in respect of each DIRT look-back audit: the name of the financial institution concerned; the amount of additional DIRT payable by that institution as a result of the audit; the amount of interest and penalties; whether an assessment has been raised and if that assessment has been appealed; <Col N="280" /> whether the audit has been completed at the date of the report; the amount of any payment on account made; and such further particulars as Revenue thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Apart from the report which must be made to the Committee of Public Accounts by 1 November 2000, the Revenue Commissioners have also been empowered to publish information at any time, either before or after that date. The section also augments the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to obtain information in the course of a DIRT audit.</P>
    <P>Section 162 of the Act provides for certain changes to the legal requirements for the publication of certain details of tax defaulters. Since 1983 the Revenue Commissioners have been required to compile and publish a list of persons on whom either a fine or other penalty has been imposed by the courts or in whose case the commissioners have accepted a settlement offer in lieu of initiating legal proceedings. Publication is prohibited where the settlement is the result of a voluntary disclosure; where the 1993 tax amnesty applies; or where the settlement amount does not exceed £10,000.</P>
    <P>The list of names of tax defaulters is published on a quarterly basis and gives details of the name, address and occupation of the person concerned and the fine or penalty imposed by the courts or the amount of the tax settlement involved. As a result of the recent Finance Act the published list will now give a description of the circumstances relating to the default of evasion, for example, whether a case may have arisen out of a specific inquiry or investigation. This will help identify settlements which have arisen from the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, tribunals or company law inquiries.</P>
    <P>I made the point when publishing the Bill that there were constitutional limits on what could be done in respect of a limited number of the Committee of Public Accounts tax recommendations. Deputies will be aware that the report recommended that the Government consider the imposition of a levy on the financial institutions. It further recommended that the proceeds of the levy should go towards the funding of the Foundation for Investing in Communities including the National Endowment, the Children's Trust and Business in the Community.</P>
    <P>I asked the Attorney General for advice on this recommendation. The advice I have received is that any involuntary levy of a restitutionary kind would be found to be a form of quasi-criminal import which would offend the Constitution. The Attorney General also advised that a levy cannot be introduced retrospectively. This advice is founded on Article 15.5 of the Constitution which states that &ldquo;the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;. I am sure Deputies can appreciate the basic aim of the constitutional restriction on changing the law retrospectively which is to protect citizens from the unjust application of new laws. It is not a rule that <Col N="281" /> can be set aside in any one set of circumstances regardless of what support such a move might attract.</P>
    <P>The constitutional imperative does not affect the conduct of the look-back audit by Revenue. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are conducting audits back to 1986. Some 40 or so institutions which are &ldquo;relevant deposit takers&rdquo; under the DIRT legislation will be covered in the audit programme. To date, 28 audits have commenced and preparatory arrangements have been made for the balance. These audits are being carried out using the new powers given to Revenue in the Finance Act 1999. Before 25 March 1999 Revenue officers could not enter a bank premises, except in very limited circumstances and in the case of DIRT could not get behind non-resident declarations to examine, for example, the account transactions or the bank documentation which might indicate whether an account was bogus.</P>
    <P>The focus of Revenue's DIRT look-back audits is on checking a sample of non-resident accounts, as provided for in the legislation, in each of the financial institutions concerned. I understand this sampling procedure is being carried out on a stratified basis; the sampling is weighted towards higher value accounts. The information gathered from checking the sample of non-resident accounts, together with the other information obtained by inspectors in the course of their audits, will lead to an estimation of the level of DIRT under-deducted by the financial institution. This work is well advanced. While a significant amount of work remains to be done, I understand the Revenue Commissioners hope to have completed the auditing work by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>When the Revenue Commissioners have completed the audit in each financial institution they will present the results to the management and seek to reach agreement on the amount of underpaid DIRT liabilities together with interest and penalties. If agreement is reached the case can be settled on that basis. On the other hand, if agreement is not forthcoming an assessment will be raised by Revenue which can be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners and the courts.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that may arise in the course of these look-back audits is the question of documentary deficiencies in relation to non-resident declarations. This has already surfaced in the media recently in the specific context of IFSC banks. I understand representatives of the Financial Services Industry Association met Revenue on 25 February last and that there has also been an exchange of correspondence clarifying the continuation of certain procedures agreed with my Department and Revenue some years ago and which were referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report. These procedures, which sought to reduce the administrative burden in cases of certain non-resident situations, are of particular relevance to the IFSC institutions whose business is dealing with non-resident corporate investors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that a common-sense approach will be adopted in relation to latitude in the area of documentary deficiencies. For example, it has been suggested by commentators that an otherwise properly completed non-resident declaration would be unacceptable if a London address did not also have &ldquo;England&rdquo; on the form. This is certainly not the case. The Revenue Commissioners will not be unreasonable in their approach on such matters.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners indicated to the FSIA that each institution will have an opportunity to discuss with them the findings of the audit in its case, including the implications of all documentary deficiencies, before any conclusions are reached and that the concerns of the institutions can be discussed further in that context.</P>
    <P>While the Revenue Commissioners are required by law to report to the Committee of Public Accounts by November, it is Revenue's job to assess and collect unpaid DIRT, interest and penalties. The Committee of Public Accounts has no role in this. The Committee of Public Accounts  will not decide how much the financial institutions will pay or how they should be penalised. This has been made clear on a number of occasions by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Jim Mitchell, but it bears repetition as there may be some misunderstanding about this.</P>
    <P>The question has also been raised as to how Revenue will approach the issue of the so-called &ldquo;underlying tax&rdquo;, that is the tax liability of the individual holder of a bogus non-resident account. The source of the moneys on deposit in many bogus non-resident cases may be undeclared business income and the unpaid taxes on such undeclared income may be far more significant in amount and value than any unpaid DIRT.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which will have to be considered by the Revenue Commissioners in due course when they finish with the DIRT audit of the financial institutions. I know from experience that it takes many staff hours for a Revenue inspector to finalise a back-duty case, so it will be time-consuming for Revenue to finalise back-duty settlements in many thousands of bogus non-resident cases dating back over 20 or 30 years. It is for the Revenue Commissioners to decide how they will go about this. It is possible that everybody who evaded tax using a bogus non-resident account will be investigated in due course. As I said during the Finance Bill debates, I believe we will be visiting this whole issue again but at present Revenue's focus is rightly on establishing and assessing the DIRT arrears of the financial institutions going back to 1986</P>
    <P>I indicated recently in addressing the Institute of Taxation that the process of inquiring into past failures and defects was a healthy one and a sign of democratic maturity. The important message is that we should learn from past mistakes. I see no reason those charged with the exercise of public functions should be concerned over such examinations once they discharge their duties in a <Col N="283" /> reasonable and responsible manner. It is possible, as in all things, to go to extremes but I would hope that such a reaction does not set in. We as public representatives and law makers should always seek to ensure the exercise of regulatory and supervisory powers does not amount merely to form filling and keeping the file straight but that such powers are applied by public officials with the judgment, seriousness and common sense that is the hallmark of an effective supervisory system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of serving as a member of the sub-committee that conducted the DIRT inquiry. I commend the work of each of my colleagues on the sub-committee. I commend the performance of the Clerk and staff of the Committee of Public Accounts and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas generally who rallied to the cause. I record my thanks to my adviser, Mr. Fergus O'Rahilly; Mr. Eugene McMahon and Mr. Mark Kennedy of Chapman Flood Mazars; Mr. Frank Clarke, senior counsel; Ms Mary Irvine, senior counsel; Mr. Paul Gilligan, senior counsel, and the two junior counsel who assisted. In particular I commend the leadership of the Chairman, Deputy Jim Mitchell. I commend the contribution of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell. I thank the Minister for Finance for his co-operation and assistance with various requirements of the inquiry as they arose.</P>
      <P>The inquiry was a success because of a combination of factors. The collegiate effort and cohesion demonstrated by the sub-committee, the painstaking preparation dictated by the Chairman, his scrupulous insistence on fair procedures and attention to detail as well as his boundless energy and enthusiasm for the project were major factors. The dedication of the staff and their willingness to work above and beyond the call of duty were a demonstration of public service at its best. The DIRT inquiry must be a headline for how public servants, given a sense of mission and purpose, will respond to the challenge.</P>
      <P>For the enterprise to be successful it was necessary that the members of the sub-committee not only did their homework but functioned in a politically non-partisan, co-ordinated and cohesive manner. We managed to do that, from which I draw two conclusions. In appropriate circumstances it can be done again and, depending on the nature of the issues being inquired into, it will not always be possible to achieve this impartial concerted effort. For example, if the nature of the subject matter being inquired into was party political, inquiry by parliamentary committee would not easily work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DIRT inquiry was a huge undertaking. Experienced Members of this House looking in from the outside will have drawn their own conclusions about the scale of the enterprise, the complexity of the task, the volume of documentation, the quality of the questioning and the <Col N="284" /> soundness of the conclusions. I am certain I speak for all my colleagues when I say that any estimate of the work it entailed is likely to seriously understate what was actually involved. The purpose of this debate is to learn from the experience. For example, no other inquiry that I know of habitually met for a full day and on successive days for as long as was required. By comparison to other inquiries the DIRT inquiry was run on a shoestring budget. The chairman outlined the final figures.</P>
    <P>One senior counsel described the inquiry as being equivalent to a largescale commercial litigation. He said that in such a case, for example, lawyers would have sought discovery of documents for at least six months in advance. Sometimes Deputies who served on the sub-committee received files for the first time at 8 p.m. the preceding night. This was not ideal and over a period of six weeks imposed its own strain. Deputies should not find themselves in a similar position again.</P>
    <P>To some extent this touches on the question of parliamentary reform. A casual first glance at the Minister's script would suggest that the Government is taking the report generally and many of its recommendations seriously. It is too early to say, however, whether everything in his script and all the report's recommendations will be implemented. This will have to be monitored. I accept that in the Finance Act the Minister has recognised a number of important matters and seems committed to seeing others through. His script makes almost no reference, however, to the question of parliamentary reform. That is a major weakness and it probably points to the fact that this House will have to address the issue. It is naive to expect that this will come from the Civil Service and, the nature of government being what it is, it is not likely to come from Government.</P>
    <P>The people most in favour of parliamentary reform are those who are out of government. In government other matters preoccupy them. Some of the conclusions drawn that the DIRT inquiry show the way for future inquiries and that it will automatically terminate the holding of tribunals of inquiry under the 1921 Act are facile and superficial and not based on fact given the major decisions that we have to make on parliamentary reform. The chairman of the committee in particular was very strong on this point and submitted a number of papers, edited versions of which appear in the report. It may fall to the office of the Ceann Comhairle to take some action to put a mechanism in place to allow us sift through the individual recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>In the calm of the House there is no appreciation of the workload involved or of the fact that virtually all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas had to be mustered to sustain the effort. No other parliamentary work was enabled to proceed while the inquiry was under way. Chairpersons of other committees had to abandon their work for the duration of the inquiry. Even then the stresses and strains imposed on the <Col N="285" /> system threatened on occasion the conclusion of the inquiry. There is a world of difference between the shoestring budget on which the inquiry was run and the figures that one reads for tribunals of inquiry. It could not be done again without serious and substantial reform.</P>
    <P>In assessing the inquiry it is necessary to acknowledge the vitally important contribution made by the live televising of the hearings by TG4. I am satisfied that the same work could have been undertaken but to much lesser effect without live television. The extent of democratic participation transformed the exercise. People watched and assessed the demeanour and conduct of the main actors. They weighed the evidence for themselves and measured the significance of what was happening before their eyes. The foresight and innovation of TG4 deserves to be acknowledged in this House. It was a considerable public service. I have no idea why RTE current affairs failed to recognise the significance of what was happening. The lid was being lifted on one aspect of social history over a quarter of a century, and the week before the hearings got under way RTE communicated to us that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; would not cover the proceedings because RTE news would report extensively on it. RTE news did a good job, but it is remarkable that RTE could not manage a brief nightly look-back programme. After all, if it was business as usual and there was a committee of the House sitting on pub licensing hours or the price of the pint, it would be faithfully reported by &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. The success of TG4 and pressure from the sub-committee did eventually lead to an occasional nightly programme but overall RTE television seems to have misunderstood initially, at least, what was afoot.</P>
    <P>Two radio shows, in particular, &ldquo;The Last Word&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo;, recognised the significance from the beginning and played a major part in informing, especially that section of the public who could not manage to view the TG4 reports. At a time when newspaper proprietors and other media decision makers seem to have decided that there is only a declining market for the daily proceedings in the Oireachtas, the feedback on the DIRT inquiry was refreshing.</P>
    <P>Last night in a casual discussion on this, a younger colleague and first-time Member of the House told me that I should cop myself on because people are not interested, society has changed and current affairs and politics are not the staple diet of any significant sliver of the population, and media owners and newspaper proprietors respond to that. There is a great deal of objective evidence which suggests he is right and I am wrong. If one looks at the coverage of the proceedings of this House on any given day, it has diminished to a quarter of a page in the paper of record and frequently one cannot find it in the other newspapers. I am talking about coverage of the House as distinct from political stories, some <Col N="286" /> of which are trivial. Only those stories which are controversial or negative are reported. Nowadays perhaps <i>The Examiner</i> probably makes a better stab at it than any of the others.</P>
    <P>My younger colleague may be right, but that is bad for our democracy. It is an unwelcome development and it is extraordinary that the media proprietors, who criticise Members of this House so much about the manner in which they discharge their functions, have not made any effort to accommodate the fact that there is now a detailed committee structure in place in this House. On any given day there are three or four committees meeting simultaneously. The committee of which I am a member has had already 11 or 12 meetings on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, for example, but not a single journalist has visited us yet and not a single line of coverage has appeared in the newspapers. That is not a matter of great import in one sense when one considers that no attention was given to the detailed scrutiny of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2000, controversial and all as it was supposed to be. When the traffic is all one way in terms of criticism of Members of this House, it is fair to point out to those who own the newspapers and plan the coverage that there are some 21 committees of this House doing detailed work which normally would have had to have been accommodated in the Chamber and it goes unremarked and unassessed</P>
    <P>There is genuine public interest in whether a inquiry by parliamentary committee can replace tribunals of inquiry. I would rather see the question expressed in terms of whether in certain circumstances matters might be referred to parliamentary inquiry rather than to tribunals as we have known them and whether there are aspects of the DIRT inquiry methodology which might be imported with profit into the tribunal of inquiry system. In assessing this, we should be careful not to make exaggerated claims for the DIRT inquiry. It is not to denigrate our work to note that perhaps it is somewhat unlikely that the same factors will all recur. For example, the financial institutions into which the sub-committee inquired more or less co-operated at all stages with the inquiry or at least they did not seek to obstruct the work of the inquiry in the manner which we observe at Dublin Castle. Accordingly the Comptroller and Auditor General was enabled to do the preliminary work in a reasonable period, thus, in effect, compiling the book of evidence for the public hearings.</P>
    <P>The planning of the DIRT inquiry was meticulously carried out over a number of months so that important questions like the manner of interrogation, the order in which to take institutions and witnesses, etc., were dealt with in detail and adhered to. Because the inquiry was a parliamentary innovation and there was a consciousness that the reputation of the Dáil was to some extent riding on the outcome, there was single-minded mobilisation of Members and staff behind the effort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> There was manifest public support for the success of the enterprise, thanks in particular to TG4. Banks generally are not top of the pops and their customers approved of them being obliged to account for their actions in public.</P>
    <P>The scope and tenor of media coverage generally assisted the effort. For the duration of the hearings and for many weeks besides, Deputies were rarely seen in their constituencies. The media swung from the customary hard-bitten cynicism to gradual serious analysis and extensive coverage, which greatly helped explain Deputies' unavailability for other business. I know that is something which might seem of little interest to people who do not have to offer themselves to the electorate for re-employment every three years, but it happens to be important. The serious manner in which there was a focus on the inquiry and the serious issues with which it was dealing made our job tolerable. I am not sure that a different six Deputies charged with a different inquiry into a different subject matter would get the same tolerance. Again that is an argument for the back-up and reform to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>In that regard I want to refer briefly to the implications of the report for the great institutions of State, whether it is the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or Ministers, the officeholders themselves. All demonstrated the absence of public accountability which, in turn, points to a failure of Parliament to discharge its responsibilities fully in this regard. I am intrigued by the attitude of the Department of Finance which seemed to have started out as hugely sceptical of the entire enterprise. It took a bit more than a week for the Department to change its view and take the inquiry seriously. There seemed to have been an attitude that the chairman and members of the sub-committee would stay with it because of tremendous publicity on days one and two, but that after that they would return to doing what Deputies do. Within a week it was clear that was not going to happen and we received a major submission from the Department of Finance which was of considerable assistance.</P>
    <P>I think the Department was reflecting not just the scepticism but outright opposition which existed within the public service to the very concept of an inquiry of this kind. We heard evidence from former distinguished senior civil servants, for whom I have high regard, and it was clear from the tenor of their remarks that they were not just sceptical but enormously resented what was under way. From private discussions etc. one knows there are huge misgivings within the Civil Service about this kind of development and matters such as the Freedom of Information Act. There are dedicated, committed, honest and hard working civil servants who believe it will adversely change the nature of governance as we know it. I am fervently convinced this is not correct, but I acknowledge that such misgivings exist. <Col N="288" /> I sincerely hope that the manner in which the Members of the Dáil applied themselves to the DIRT inquiry over a sustained and prolonged period, including the time it took to compile the report, which was by far the most difficult part of the process, will have provided reassurance among the senior echelons of the Civil Service about the seriousness with which the entire project was undertaken. Whereas I am sure some senior civil servants have serious reservations about some of our findings and conclusions, I do not think they can point to an absence of fair procedure or scrupulous attention to detail in terms of the way the inquiry was conducted.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rehearse conclusions in the report in respect of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank etc. &ndash; time does not allow for this. The analysis and conclusions of the report stand. It is not above criticism. However, it is noteworthy that it has attracted very little criticism from independent quarters. Claims that we were soft on Ministers for Finance because they are fellow politicians is the single substantial criticism I recall. This is interesting because if we drew conclusions or findings which were not supported by the evidence adduced by the inquiry the same commentators would be the first to criticise us. I am not disputing that the political culture in the years inquired into accurately reflected the attitude of some citizens to taxation. Quite frankly it was apparent that very many of our citizens were strangers to the concept of taxation, and the political culture in the House reflected this. Such an inquiry must draw conclusions based on the evidence adduced. There are some serious conclusions in the report concerning successive Ministers for Finance, but perhaps these are not the conclusions some people would have liked. This is because those conclusions could not have been reached from the evidence presented.</P>
    <P>Similarly the lawyers and ourselves have been criticised for departing from the normal practice of members of the sub-committee carrying out the questioning. In this case we thought it was a good idea, for reasons which seemed obvious to us as politicians, that the questioning ought to be done by senior counsel as the danger existed that I may have used the opportunity, for example, to be very tough on one Minister for Finance and very lax when questioning another. Perhaps it is not understood that the lawyers were circumscribed in what they could do by the rules and regulations which guided us all. We were not permitted to inquire into matters of policy, which are not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts. Therefore, I do not think this constitutes a major criticism.</P>
    <P>Citizens were intrigued by the opportunity of lifting the veil on one the most respected and feared institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>I was just getting off the runway. Time flies when one is enjoying oneself.</P>
      <P>I was going to refer to one of the most respected and feared institutions of State, namely, the Revenue Commissioners. Ordinary taxpayers, especially those who are compliant, were fascinated to be allowed look behind the curtains, and they did so with mixed emotions. On the one hand they saw some of the most highly motivated and dedicated public servants in the employment of the State while on the other hand they were amazed to find that the direction and management of Revenue was often on a more haphazard and less professional basis then they thought.</P>
      <P>Because I have so little time, I wish to finish by saying there are a number of things in the conduct of the DIRT inquiry which might be imported with profit to the conduct of tribunals of inquiry, for example, the practice of an independent expert being required to do the preliminary stage and produce the book of evidence. There are still issues which will inevitably arise in public affairs where investigation and inquiry by a tribunal of inquiry will be the only way to proceed. We went outside the book of evidence, but nonetheless it greatly assisted the expeditious and efficient conduct of the inquiry, something which might be taken into account by tribunals of inquiry. I do not think we should confuse the cost of lawyers with the efficacy of tribunals of inquiry. Of course lawyers cost too much, there can be no argument about this. That can be the subject of another day's discussion, but if the matter is manifestly political a parliamentary committee would find great difficulty in terms of investigating it.</P>
      <P>One of the things dictated by the chairman which worked very well was that a number of witnesses were present at the same time and questions could be addressed to more than one witness. This greatly expedited the work of the inquiry and did not lead to days on end being spent chasing red herrings. Rather, red herrings could be killed on the spot. The extent of amnesia we encountered was remarkable. It was remarkable that so many people had such a casual acquaintance with the full truth but the passage of time has that effect. We made conclusions which we honestly felt we were entitled to make on the basis of the evidence produced before us. We would like to have inquired into many other matters. The chairman of the committee pointed out that the inquiry is not finished but it has the most fundamental implications for the conduct of our public affairs, the manner in which we inquire into matters of public interest and, hopefully, the better governance of this democracy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the report and, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I pay tribute to the chairman who played a fantastic role in leading this ground-breaking investigation. I am glad my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, concentrated on the issue of Dáil reform, which was at the centre of <Col N="290" /> this inquiry. People could be forgiven for thinking that it was a wonderful opportunity for the public to gain an insight into the arid worlds of the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and a series of large, successful banks and communications between them, including internal memoranda. However, that was not the purpose of the inquiry, although it is quite clear that many people felt a wonderful, malicious pleasure as they witnessed the discomfiture of the bankers, Revenue officials and others who were summoned to recount the culture of non-compliance which thrived in 1980s Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was recently reminded of this culture as I read some old files. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried out a survey five or six years ago which highlighted that two thirds of people approved of tax cheating. We are still in transition from the culture of non-compliance which pertained during the period investigated by PAC. It is dramatically brought home to Members of the House as we must now register our interests, such as other sources of income, on an annual basis. It is good that we are moving towards a culture of compliance but it is a very painful journey for banks, politicians and all the other institutions which were put under the spotlight and found wanting in regard to the procedures they applied.</P>
      <P>The issue of Dáil reform is central to the relevance of politicians. They are as essential to democracy as bankers are to the economy. No economy can operate without an efficient and competitive banking system and no democracy can work without efficient and professional politicians who provide valuable public service which is required as much in these prosperous times as it was in the 1980s when we did not live in a prosperous society.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of John Kenneth Galbraith's book entitled<i> The Culture of Contentment </i>in which issues are raised that are clearly mirrored in our society, which is overseen by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance in particular. There are signs that Ireland is experiencing a culture of contentment where the haves enjoy the great benefits of a booming economy and the upswing in the economy but the have nots do not and are becoming marginalised. This is characterised by the increasingly middle class voting pattern at elections as disadvantaged people, who are unemployed and do not have educational opportunities, are not voting and fully participating in the economy and political structures. It is a formidable challenge for us, which we should be careful not to avoid. Reforming the operation of this House is central to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am slightly saddened that Deputy Rabbitte feels that younger Members are not interested and he seemed to suggest that media owners are reducing the coverage of the House and politics generally. It is often forgotten that while there <Col N="291" /> was a culture of non-compliance in the 1980s, there was also huge interest in politics. Media commentators regularly remarked on the large vote turn-out here relative to other European democracies at the time. Oddly, there has been a change from abnormally high turn-outs at elections to low turn-outs. I do not suggest complacency in this regard but voter participation is currently average in comparison to other countries which are as economically developed as Ireland. That does not mitigate against the ever present danger in our democracy that politicians could become irrelevant to the masses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relevance of our system I was shocked and appalled by the reaction to the remarks of the Taxing Master, James Flynn, last week. There was a great deal of sense in what he said regarding the tribunals, and perhaps it offended certain Members that he threw down the gauntlet to the Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the tribunals at Dublin Castle. All Members feel that they should be wound up quickly because they are going on too long. However, the Houses established them and all of us should take responsibility for that. The Taxing Master's remarks challenge us to develop an investigative structure such as that established for the DIRT liability issue in order to instigate similar inquiries into issues of pressing public concern. A great deal can be learned from the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry. However, it is important that we do not overestimate the challenge of reforming the House by simply setting up similar inquiries into controversies as they arise.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a worrying and much more dangerous trend in regard to the business of the House. A number of weeks ago Deputy Mitchell and I questioned Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the Dáil, when he appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts. He informed us that this Parliament is the worst resourced in Europe in a plethora of areas, including the number of staff per Member. We are at the bottom of the European league. I hope the Minister for Finance will examine the resources issue as it is critical in terms of parliamentary reform.</P>
    <P>The wider issue of Members' pay must be addressed. The average working day for a politician comprises 12 hours. It cannot be expected that highly talented people will be enticed into politics when pay is low relative to salaries in the private sector and elsewhere. The Minister displayed great courage in this area previously when he increased our expenses, but there must be an underlying shift in the way the House is resourced and Members are remunerated before we address the difficult and often vexed issues of electoral and parliamentary reform.</P>
    <P>One must distinguish between the three distinct phases that occurred in the inquiry. The first was the voluntary phase, the second phase <Col N="292" /> involved the Comptroller and Auditor General, as Deputy Rabbitte put it, garnering a book of evidence, and the third was the public hearings phase. I think it was Deputy Durkan and myself who took the view in the committee that it might have been better to push the voluntary phase to its ultimate conclusion where, in respect of banks that refused to appear, we would invoke our powers. That was an interesting discussion and the investigation was a good one but unfortunately people have failed to distinguish between those three distinct phases and the purpose of each phase as it occurred. The public hearings were, in a sense, only a development of the investigations already carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. They were to satisfy a public need that Parliament be seen to be in control and able to investigate pressing matters of concern.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, when Deputy Jim Mitchell was not in the Chamber, and in paying tribute to him, I believe many people took a sneaking pleasure in the discomfort of bankers, Ministers for Finance and other worthies of our society who were found to be somewhat wanting when it came to the witness box. I am sure some politicians would have taken pleasure in this too because we are often treated with a certain degree of arrogance by those institutions, as if we do not understand matters, but some of our more notable bankers were singularly ill-equipped to deal with the public theatre in which we, as politicians, have to perform every day. The purpose of the inquiry was not to embarrass bankers but to hold them to account, and that was an important exercise.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate consequences of the entire investigation has been a profound misunderstanding about the purpose of the inquiry. I made remarks recently at a dinner of the Irish Association of Corporate Treasurers that some people appear to have mistaken the intent of the report, for instance, in relation to the companies and financial institutions based in the Irish Financial Services Centre in the docklands, that in some way this report should be used as a justification for a full retrospective examination and full retrospective documentary compliance in relation to DIRT. That was not the purpose of the inquiry, although documentary compliance is obviously important. I note the Chairman's remarks that a protocol has been prepared and I note also that the Revenue Commissioners have met representatives of the Irish Financial Services Association who have expressed their concerns about the insistence on retrospective documentary compliance from companies that are not based in the domestic retail banking market but in the international financial markets and who essentially do not incur a DIRT liability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement yesterday from the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Dermot Quigley, that there will be a common-sense approach taken, particularly towards those <Col N="293" /> IFSC banks. That is important for a number of reasons. I have stated previously, and I do not mind repeating it again here, that when one examines the culture and the economy of the 1980s, the Irish Financial Services Centre was one of the flagship projects that pulled this country out of recession and made it a location worthy of investment. It acted as a beacon to the international investment community, that Ireland was getting its act together and that it was a good place in which to invest. It has also led, over the short period since its inception, to the creation of 8,500 jobs. I must declare an interest at this stage. As my wife works there I need the IFSC to continue to prosper if I am to live in the style to which I have become accustomed. I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not in the Chamber but as the House knows, it is virtually Fianna Fáil policy now that one has to force one's wife to work. If nothing else, I am a fully compliant member of Fianna Fáil. I insist that my wife works and shares in the household bills. We are all doing our bit for the Minister for Finance and his budget.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Revenue Commissioners are taking a common-sense view on this retrospective documentary compliance issue in relation to the IFSC. There was a certain amount of hype about the issue in recent weeks and months and I am glad they are taking the responsible approach that is needed because the last thing this country needs is a run on the Irish Financial Services Centre. I urge the Minister for Finance and Government, as a unit, to re-examine the IFSC as a source of further financial innovation and development as a centre. With our current obsession with the benefits of the high tech economy there is a danger we will take our eye off the ball and forget about the financial services centre as a strong source of ongoing employment in Dublin and throughout the country. We need to examine how we can innovate even more in terms of the financial products that are produced there.</P>
    <P>To return to the report, I was rather intrigued at Deputy Rabbitte's reference to lifting the veil, a very resonant phrase, on various institutions in our national life but we have reached the point where we have to think again about lifting veils. We have come through an intense period of subjecting ourselves to self-examination and self-criticism in relation to what happened in the 1980s and at other times. That covers the political, banking, religious and many other institutions who have taken the full heat of investigation and inquiry. I am the last person to advocate a cover-up or sweeping something under the carpet and trying to avoid important issues but it is important that we, as a Parliament, take the lead in this regard and focus on the future, on reform and on changing and putting in place procedures that will make us compliant. It is important that we should not move from a culture of non-com<Col N="294" /> pliance to one of over-compliance. As a small country dependent on exports and on the world market, as we saw in recent months with the movement in oil prices, we see clearly the way the international economy can affect us and the way our economy is open to being disturbed. One of the great benefits of our recovery in the 1980s and of the prosperity we built in the 1960s and 1970s is that we were a small, open economy, in every sense of the word, our administrative burden was not too heavy and our regulatory environment did not discourage people from investing here. It is important that we do not move to a position of over-regulation. That would not suit Ireland.</P>
    <P>I see in some of the measures being adopted by Government, which I have to support from time to time by way of Dáil vote, a tendency towards a regulatory environment or system that is not suited to a country of our size or to a country whose capital markets are not huge when compared to the capital markets of countries like Britain, France, Italy, Spain and even the United States. It appears that even within this House there is a tendency among some people to insist on a level of business regulation which is more suited to countries with large capital markets. Countries with large capital markets have a justifiable belief in strong regulation because of their size, power and influence and the ease with which they can get out of control and have an adverse impact on the under or over-arching economy within which they perform. We do not have the benefit of strong financial markets, both in terms of volume and the velocity of trades. We do not have the kind of liquidities in our market that we see in other financial markets and we should be careful about the whole issue of business regulation.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to over-regulate here as a somewhat shock response to the revelations we have seen. It is important that my intention in using the phrase &ldquo;over regulation&rdquo; is not misinterpreted by some. Dick Walsh, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, chose to deliberately misinterpret my remarks in that regard in a speech to the corporate treasurers in the past few weeks. It is not my intention to mollify the banks and suggest they should get off easily. The focus point of the DIRT inquiry was to ensure that those domestic banks which deliberately understated or failed to provide adequately for the level of DIRT tax liability due should have their liabilities fully investigated and fully recovered. That is the very minimum this House, the committee and, I hope, the Revenue Commissioners would expect as a result of this investigation.</P>
    <P>I commend the report to the House. I also commend the chairman, who is now back in the Chamber, for his great work in the most difficult of personal circumstances, given his health problems. This report will stand as part of the record <Col N="295" /> of this House and as a landmark in Irish public affairs in the 1980s and 1990s. It marks the turning of a corner for this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, who also chaired the sub-committee, on the work, co-ordination and determination he put into carrying out this inquiry. The public and Members of this House who were not members of the sub-committee can have very little comprehension of the effort he had to put in. Although he would not like me to say this, it was above and beyond the call of duty for someone at the centre of such an inquiry to return to work only one week after undergoing surgery. That should not be forgotten in terms of the dedication shown by Members of Parliament to the tasks they are given. I do not think such an inquiry could take place without that level of commitment and determination, certainly not within that space of time.</P>
      <P>One achievement of the inquiry, which possibly gave rise to a certain amount of resentment, is that it set a standard or precedent and reiterated the right of parliamentarians to do the job they were elected to do. That job might be unsavoury at times and might not always receive the full support of all the people. People might resent the questions they are asked and some might feel we are incompetent or incapable of asking the right questions. However, that is Parliament. It is elected by the people for the people, to work and act on their behalf until it is changed by the public.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how, in some quarters, the focus of attention seems to have shifted over past years from Parliament. As was mentioned in a recent radio programme, the movers and shakers are elsewhere. Perhaps, we are responsible for that ourselves. Governments of all political parties do not make major announcements in the House but hold press conferences or make announcements in centres which will attract attention for another reason. That seems to achieve the purpose of the exercise, which is to get the soundbite or kick-start required for the particular issue. However, there was always a very dangerous void in this or any other country when politics was set aside. There is a tendency in this country to disregard the parliamentary system and to assume that the power and authority comes from elsewhere. However, it does not, it still rests here. Some quarters might find that difficult to understand and accept. While that might not always be palatable, it is still here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the chairman and my colleagues on the sub-committee. I also compliment the entire committee for the confidence it showed in us and the sub-committee on the manner in which it went about its business as a result of the directions it got. I was one of those who felt we should <Col N="296" /> have gone ahead with the system we were accustomed to. However, I now recognise that this House does not have legal advice and counsel's opinion available to it on an ongoing basis. This is one of the few Parliaments that does not have that facility, and without such a facility, it would be very difficult to move within the law on a daily basis from one subject to the next in a way that ensured there could be no comeback or reference to the courts.</P>
    <P>By the same token, I strongly believe that Parliament is supreme. It is not the business of Parliament to be subservient to anybody else. We might have our faults and failings and might not always do what we aspire to, nonetheless, this is still the Parliament, elected by the people for the people. We should not have to look over our shoulders when we go about our parliamentary business, wondering whether the courts will look upon us with a certain amount of disdain. This is still Parliament, the supreme authority.</P>
    <P>It will remain to be seen whether the report produced by the sub-committee and committee is a success or failure. One cannot say at this stage that it was one or the other &ndash; that will be determined by the debate in the years to come. However, it is important to reiterate that Members of Parliament, sitting in a sub-committee or committee of that nature, should never be fearful of doing their job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever one is charged with or is responsible for, whether one is a Member of the Dáil or Seanad, a Minister or a Minister of State, one's duty is to do it to the best of one's ability and let the consequences follow, no matter how unsavoury that might be at times.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee was successful for one very important reason, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred. He correctly said it might not have been as successful if it had been a committee of political inquiry. The most obvious factor in the course of the sub-committee's hearings was that it never broke down on political lines. That amazing performance was due in no small measure to the fact that the chairman has repeated over the ten years I have been a member of the committee the need for it to be apolitical, which is what the sub-committee was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the pressure was put on &ndash; of which I am the living example &ndash; it would have been very easy for the committee to be hauled into a lay-by and break down on political lines. It would have been very easy for those who had a reason to bring the sub-committee's proceedings to a halt to take the measures necessary to bring that about. The sub-committee would then be seen to have failed. In those circumstances, the sub-committee proved it had the grit to take on an issue, follow it through, set politics to one side and con<Col N="297" /> tinue. That was important. Other committees that wish to emulate that exercise will find, in the final analysis, that they will be successful only if they can achieve that.</P>
    <P>The chairman and members of the sub-committee must also be complimented on another matter. I do not think even the members of the sub-committee fully appreciate the time, effort and energy put into it by the chairman and the members themselves. At the best of times, it is rather unusual to work the kind of hours the committee worked, but it had to work those hours to achieve the results within a specified period. To continue working those hours right through the weekends and late into the night, as happened in many cases, requires a great deal of determination as well as personal, social and family sacrifices. When an evaluation is done, as in time it will be, on the success or failure of this report, that is one of the issues that will come into focus.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of the House, I have occasion to visit the courts from time to time on behalf of constituents and it is interesting to see how the court system works. The adversarial system of this House is somewhat different, however. For example, negotiations do not take place between counsel behind the scenes here. One just asks the question and the people opposite, whether they are in Government or Opposition, have two options: they can either answer the question or refuse to do so. It is interesting to see how both systems compare, but I will say no more than that.</P>
    <P>The legal advice the sub-committee had during the course of its hearings was invaluable. We got very good guidance right from the beginning. With the benefit of hindsight and 20-20 vision, I accept that if we had not had that guidance we probably would not have been able to see the inquiry through to its conclusion.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been some comment by those who seek to compare the parliamentary inquiry system with that of tribunals, but they are absolutely different. It would not be physically possible for a parliamentary committee to set up an inquiry of the nature referred to in recent public commentaries. The time commitment required would be so great as to make it impossible. Arising from our most recent experience in this regard, Members of the Dáil probably have the ability to carry out one such inquiry in the lifetime of a Parliament. More than that would require such sacrifice as to make it virtually impossible for them to operate as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards the necessity for this inquiry, we must remember that it arose after prior examination by the Committee of Public Accounts on similar or associated issues. Despite that, we did not turn up many of the things that were turned up by the DIRT inquiry. Why? The whole attitude to asking questions and eliciting replies now <Col N="298" /> come into focus in this House. It is far better to be straightforward and up-front in answering a question as it is posed. It is a defence and a protection to a Minister or a Department to operate that system. Anything other than that can ultimately lead to serious embarrassment, first, for the Minister concerned and, second, for the individuals in a Department who may well have responsibility in the matter at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It would be a sad state of affairs if people became reluctant to ask questions and were fearful of doing so because pressure might be brought to bear on them. In such circumstances, the parliamentary system would begin to sag and would ultimately fail. When I was first elected to the House, I remember a senior Member, the late Oliver J. Flanagan, speaking at one of our parliamentary party meetings. He said:</P>
    <P>I want to give you one piece of advice, you gang of 25 who have arrived here today: never give up your right to ask questions in Parliament. Any attempt to curtail your activity in that area will mean a diminution in your power as parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>He was absolutely right.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Jim Mitchell referred to coverage of the sub-committee's work. TG4 certainly took an initiative which hitherto had been unheard of and I was quite surprised by the impact its coverage had on the sub-committee's hearings. Members of the sub-committee, however, were not really conscious of how their work was perceived elsewhere because they had so many other things to deal with at the time. Some other national programmes took a constructive, balanced and even-handed interest in the sub-committee's work. Programmes such as &ldquo;Tonight With Vincent Browne&rdquo;, together with George Lee and others in RTE, also took an ongoing and positive interest, not just a fleeting interest, in what happened.</P>
    <P>At the very beginning, some comments were made as to whether the sub-committee and its members would be capable of dealing with the situation as it arose. I hope the public feels that members of the sub-committee discharged their duties in an honourable fashion. I think they did, but that is not a matter for us, it is a matter for the public.</P>
    <P>In future we may well be faced with similar cases. The lesson to be learned is that Members can expect to have a great deal of pressure applied to them and they may as well face up to it before they start. They should, however, keep in mind that if they allow themselves to be deflected from their task they will not be able to do their job. Once a parliamentarian is detected as being in any way weak in that area, they are gone. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment in any great detail on the rights and wrongs of the DIRT controversy. <Col N="299" /> Rightly or wrongly, the concept of DIRT was introduced by Government in the Finance Act, 1986, which laid down certain conditions and criteria which it is the duty of everyone to follow. It makes no difference what the excuses are or who is offended. If the legislation is not in accordance with the common good, it should be repealed, but we cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a situation where people say: &ldquo;Well, we have that legislation there; it is really something that we should not have but we are not going to repeal it; it will do a good job there anyway.&rdquo;  That is not the way the system is supposed to work.</P>
    <P>The fact that the legislation was seen to be ignored by a series of people who had knowledge and responsibility in the matter was a serious matter which set a dangerous precedent and one which could have totally undermined confidence in the institutions of the State. If there is repetition of the circumstances that led to the DIRT inquiry, let us learn from the exercise we undertook.</P>
    <P>With regard to people who avoided payments of DIRT, some say that during the period in question, everybody was doing it and the taxation levels in the country were too high anyway. If one applies that principle then everybody ultimately would do the same. Ultimately, as happened during the period in question, the tax base becomes more restricted, fewer and fewer people are in the net and as a result the burden is increased on those who have no option except to be there. In those kinds of circumstances we have and should have learned a few lessons.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues on the committee for their support and solidarity and other Members of the House who were extremely supportive and helpful to me during the course of the committee's inquiries. I also thank and extend my appreciation to the senior and top ranking journalists, both around this House and countrywide, who contacted me during that time and offered their support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I had some involvement in the early days, as a Member of the Committee of Public Accounts. I was privy to some of the early evidence and the points raised. Following the work of the sub-committee, it soon became apparent to me that what it did could not be repeated. I will return to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Members involved. One could not continue working a seven day week at the level they worked and continue to work in the Parliament. I pay tribute particularly to the chairman of the committee, Deputy Jim Mitchell, for his tenacity and his doggedness throughout. His illness has been mentioned but the vast majority of people were not even aware of it because he did not let it impede him. The hours <Col N="300" /> involved were cruel. It is very hard to imagine that they could keep going. The work was very intensive and Deputy Rabbitte pointed out some of the shortcomings with the supply of material and so on and how one was expected to cope with the late briefing. They coped and produced an excellent report.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be raised, some of which are fairly obvious. What is the report worth, what is its benefit and what did it cost? Most importantly, to what use will it be put and what will happen with it? We need to examine what has happened to date. I am fairly happy with what has happened to date following the publication of the report. The onus for its implementation falls to a great extent on the Minister for Finance. I am pleased he has acted speedily to implement the parts of the report that could be implemented and to give a rational reason for the one or two recommendations he cannot implement while pointing out that he is willing to continue the work and will implement the remainder of the recommendations. It is important that people can clearly see what happened with every recommendation, how recommendations were implemented and eventually the net effect of the recommendation.</P>
    <P>We must do this because of the importance of the financial services sector to our economy over the past 10 to 15 years. It has now become a central part of our commercial life, it has been the source of much employment and the source of confidence for people who set up in industry or do business in Ireland. It is imperative that the good name of our financial institutions is clear and unsullied but that we also have a base for picking out any problems or faults and dealing with them. This report will be the benchmark from which many happenings in the future will be measured. It will be referred to, as the previous speaker said, and in the years to come its effectiveness will be judged. It is already a winner and I am not merely saying that as a Member of the Committee of Public Accounts but as someone listening to the response of professionals and the general public, who have been following the workings and output of the committee and what has happened since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the lack of interest shown by the media in general. However, the people took it on themselves to watch and take note of what was happening and how people performed. Having seen how the committee worked and watched it in action, the difference between the kind of answer given in the early days and the answers given under examination was something of an eye-opener. Asking the right question at the right time was referred to here previously, but looking back on the record of people we had examined, they were being evasive in many cases. Maybe they were not up to speed with their information, deliberately or otherwise, but it put man<Col N="301" /> ners on people to be brought before the sub-committee for examination. That is the way it should be &ndash; all questions asked should be answered clearly giving the full information available. It was probably obvious to most people in the early days that the practice of evasion was widespread. Perhaps the witnesses were afraid to commit their own institution or themselves but in the early days one or two people, more or less to protect themselves, pointed out that the practice was endemic in the financial services sector. That led into a wider inquiry.</P>
    <P>It took the setting up of an inquiry and the activities of the Members to really dig out the important information. The eye-opener for me was that this practice was so widespread. I realised after a few early questions to some of the principal witnesses &ndash; those from the Central Bank and elsewhere &ndash; that much of its business was done on trust. The question of presuming that somebody might be capable of malpractice was not even taken into account. When we asked about the surveying and supervision of institutions, the prudential supervision was the only aspect about which anyone was concerned. If the bank or institution was not going to go belly-up then anything was permitted.</P>
    <P>On a visit to the Bundesbank we found more or less the same approach from the principals who were not going to get involved in the day to day supervision of any bank or any institution. If that is the way things are, we need to establish some body who will become involved and who will supervise these financial institutions. If the Central Bank does not feel this is its role, then it is time to set up an independent, supervisory body, person or board.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, reports can be treated in many ways. They can be put on the shelf and allowed to gather dust and some recommendations can be acted on and some not. However, I am glad that so far the evidence suggests that there is great commitment to acting on this report and I do not think it will be shelved. It is imperative that all of the recommendations, where the Constitution allows, are dealt with speedily. The findings vindicate the approach of the Minister for Finance, who has repeatedly said that if taxes appear draconian people will go to any lengths to avoid paying them. They will pay for the best advice but will also avoid paying taxes in other ways. The Minister has taken a steady approach to ensure there is fairness in taxation so that people will respond and pay accordingly. This area must be monitored, but the principles are correct.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the workings of committees and at an early stage it became apparent to us that the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts were inadequate to the task of addressing the issues raised. It became obvious that extra powers would be needed and I compliment all involved <Col N="302" />&ndash; the Minister for Finance and the Government Chief Whip in particular &ndash; on the speed with which these were granted as it reflected well on the Parliament that those powers could be put in place speedily to enable the work to continue. That should be noted. Compliments should be paid when due and they are due to those involved here.</P>
    <P>It is now obvious that the powers given to the Committee of Public Accounts will have to be extended to other committees, though maybe not to the same extent. However, extra powers are required, for example, by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which is trying to deal with the issue of smoking. That committee is taking on the tobacco industry, which can bring out big names to fight its case and at present the committee is fairly powerless when it comes to taking on that industry. Extra powers will be required immediately by that committee and the success of the DIRT inquiry will help it to get them. When we examine the committee system we will find plenty of committees which require extra powers and we should not be afraid to provide them with those powers. I am not sure what the constraints were in the past, but people now demand openness. Our job is not just to deal with legislation but with other issues which require attention.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas reform has been referred to by Deputies Mitchell and Rabbitte and that will also have to be addressed. The major change involved setting up a committee to shadow each Department and a lack of facilities was immediately highlighted. Office space, broadcasting equipment and staff were in short supply and the committee secretariat was put to the pin of its collar to cope. There are also obvious shortcomings when Members are trying to attend three committee meetings a day, which is almost physically impossible. The workings of the committees need to be reviewed urgently. I appreciate that the new building will make extra space available and ease the problem somewhat, but we must examine how we are working and ensure that all our meetings have a positive outcome. Members now have the confidence to get stuck in more, which reflects the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee's success.</P>
    <P>The lack of legal advice was mentioned and that can be a handicap to ordinary committee members. Such advice is available to the Government, but ordinary backbenchers must be able to call on legal advice at times. One should not spend all day in a law agent's office, but Members need to be able to establish whether they are working within the Constitution and so on. That became apparent very quickly when the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee was set up and it will have to be part of the planned examination of the committee system.</P>
    <P>An obvious question that arises is that of tribunals <i>versus</i> parliamentary inquiries. It is not a <Col N="303" /> black and white issue. There are benefits to both approaches and there may be room for combining them. The cost of tribunals, which are open-ended, is a major shortcoming. There is an old law that work expands so as to fill the time available and in the case of tribunals it is true that the longer they last the more money can be made. That is a weakness in the system. I do not want to criticise tribunals unfairly, but that is a fact.</P>
    <P>The biggest weakness with inquiries is the sheer physical demands on Members. The DIRT inquiry involved six to eight weeks intensive work, with most people involved working seven days a week, and as Deputy Rabbitte said, all other work had to be set aside. We are elected to participate in forming legislation and to represent our constituents. We must continue with that work and it would be difficult to replicate the DIRT inquiry as a result. I would not expect too many inquiries that would demand the level of time and commitment required by the DIRT inquiry. The issues involved in that case went far back in time and involved numerous large organisations which could call on a lot of expertise, which meant it was a particularly difficult task.</P>
    <P>The public is aware of the savings involved in dealing with such matters through a parliamentary inquiry. Deputy Mitchell gave the cost of the inquiry earlier and people will ask how such inquiries can be done for that price when tribunals cost so much more. Perhaps terms of reference need to be tightened or timeframes need to be imposed on tribunals, but the question of tribunals <i>versus</i> inquiries is not as black and white as some assume. There is room for both approaches.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Members involved. They have shown us how we should do our business and the recommendations are being dealt with. I welcome the Minister's report. I do not want money flowing out of Ireland any more than any banker does. When DIRT was introduced in 1986, banks had to raise the rate of interest they paid by up to 3% to ensure there was not a total outflow of cash. I would not like to see our financial services foundation being damaged, but malpractice must be rooted out where it exists in order that people will have confidence in the sector. I agree with the Minister that the best way of ensuring tax compliance is a low tax regime and strict regulation of the system. This report should be welcome by Members of the Oireachtas and the financial services sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on this report. I notice that thus far, with the exception of the Minister, only members of the Committee of Public Accounts have contributed to the debate. I hope other Deputies will avail of the opportunity to participate in the debate as its subject matter is <Col N="304" /> not solely confined to members of the Committee of Public Accounts. It is a matter which concerns all Oireachtas Members.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I observed at first hand the tremendous work involved in this inquiry and in bringing this report to this point. I do not believe that all the committee's work was fully recognised. The task facing members of the sub-committee was a daunting one. When the sub-committee was being established, I selfishly passed the chalice on to my colleagues. I declined to serve on the sub-committee because I live far away from Dublin and could not provide the required commitment. The Fine Gael Party had two outstanding members on the sub-committee in the chairman, Deputy Mitchell, and Deputy Durkan. Everyone has acknowledged the manner in which Deputy Mitchell single-mindedly dedicated himself to this inquiry over a 14 month period. I compliment him on the manner in which he oversaw proceedings. He really believed in what he was doing and the end result will stand as a monument to him forever. I also compliment Deputy Durkan and the other members of the sub-committee who were involved in the production of this report.</P>
      <P>Apart from the ten months' preparatory work and investigation and the work carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in interviewing people and producing evidence, an extraordinary level of commitment was required from the members of the sub-committee when it was established. The sub-committee commenced sitting at the end of August and sat throughout September when the Dáil was in recess and when some of us were trying to take a few days' holidays with our families or were catching up on constituency work. The members of the sub-committee devoted themselves to being in Dublin full time, often sitting for up to ten hours per day on consecutive days. That level of dedication was unique. When the sub-committee's hearings concluded in the first week of October, the sub-committee met on several successive occasions, including some weekend sittings, to prepare the report for publication.</P>
      <P>Anyone who committed himself to serving on the sub-committee was committing himself to being present for the entirety of the hearings. Unlike the normal practice where members can exempt themselves from a committee for half an hour to do a radio interview or to attend to an urgent matter, the sub-committee members had to be in attendance at all times. The members could not even go to the bathroom while the sub-committee was in session. Given the nature of the evidence being presented to the sub-committee, all the members had to be present to hear all of it. That fact is not widely known by people outside the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies are away from their offices for whatever reasons, work continues to build up &ndash;<Col N="305" /> I know that from personal experience. I do not know how the members of the sub-committee managed to deal adequately with their Dáil and constituency business while sitting on the sub-committee for that two month period. I am glad I was relieved of that responsibility by Deputies Mitchell and Durkan. The Fine Gael Party required two members on the sub-committee to adequately represent it. I was happy to be able to pass the chalice in that regard as I would not have been in a position to devote the necessary time required for the sub-committee to produce the report.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the dedication of the chairman, Deputy Mitchell, in bringing this first report before the Dáil. The report has not yet concluded and a great deal of work remains to be done. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his commitment and I also thank the clerk and staff of the committee who rose to the occasion in supporting the sub-committee in its production of this report. Their dedication is an example of public servants working together as a team and rising to the challenge which was presented to them.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focail buíochas a ghabháil do TG4 as ucht a chraolacháin beo. Some previous speakers criticised the media coverage of the inquiry and perhaps it did not receive the coverage it deserved. However, the live proceedings on TG4 became compulsory viewing for many people throughout the country. I know that some people even had the hearings recorded. TG4 provided a wonderful service by transmitting the hearings live, particularly when the Dáil was not sitting and there was no competing activity in the Oireachtas. It informed many people that the Oireachtas does not go to sleep until September because the Dáil is adjourned. This committee and others met during the recess. Members of the Oireachtas were in Dublin carrying out their constituency work. Apart from transmitting the hearings live, TG4 also did a great service in highlighting the work of this committee and others which sit during the recess.</P>
    <P>The costs of these hearings may be questioned. The chairman confirmed a cost of £823,393, including a provision of £239,388 for IT equipment and digital recording which will continue to be available to the Oireachtas and will be of enormous benefit. This is the best value for money I have witnessed since I became a Member of this House 11 years ago. There is no reason for the public to be concerned about the cost of the DIRT inquiry although they are justified in questioning the cost of tribunals, particularly that of legal representation. However, the effect of tribunals and inquiries such as this on the mindset of the public will reap rewards. The mindset of people regarding tax liabilities has changed completely.</P>
    <P>About ten years ago, it was fashionable to seek professional advice on how to avoid tax. Tax eva<Col N="306" /> sion was widespread. However, now it is fashionable to pay one's tax on time. The attitude of the public, professional advisers and public representatives ten years ago was more lax and in some cases a blind eye was turned to tax evasion. However, people are now advised to ensure their tax affairs are in order. This change of mindset has only taken place in the past three years. In the 1980s and 1990s, tax evasion was encouraged by example and people bragged that they had undertaken various tax avoidance measures, including opening bogus offshore accounts. Public representatives and professional advisers now advise people to make sure their tax affairs are in order. This is one positive effect of this inquiry and of tribunals.</P>
    <P>This inquiry was not a simple task. There were 26 days of public hearings, two months of meetings on the report and before that ten months of preparation. As the chairman said, if the Oireachtas is reformed, inquiries such as this and tribunals will be less necessary. This must be faced up to at Oireachtas and ministerial level. Successive Ministers have been guilty in this regard although I do not know with whom the fault lies. We should be able to get answers to the questions we put down in the Dáil, even if, as some Ministers say, we do not ask the right ones. Time should be allocated for questions on matters of urgency. Adjournment matters are a farce and are insufficient. A Deputy raising a serious matter on the Adjournment addresses the relevant Minister, often the junior Minister and in some cases a substitute for the junior Minister. He or she then reads a script prepared before the Deputy raises his or her problem in the House. This does not fool anyone, the Deputy or those asking for the matter to be raised. Even if a press release is issued, everyone knows the problem is not being addressed in the reply to the matter. A great deal of work needs to be done regarding Dáil reform. The chairman referred to this and I am sure he will follow up the matter. If the Dáil is reformed, we will not need tribunals and hearings such as this.</P>
    <P>This investigation did not start when the sub-committee sat last August. Many people do not realise that the Comptroller and Auditor General had to produce a book of evidence by interviewing potential witnesses under oath in private. The wisdom of this decision was justified by the speed with which this initial stage was conducted. The required change in legislation then had to be made in the Dáil to allow this inquiry. Perhaps it would be more beneficial for everyone concerned if there was more openness in Dáil proceedings.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank all those who participated in the sub-committee and for producing this report. I hope the health of the chairman or any other member was not affected and that their constituency work, which is an important aspect of the <Col N="307" /> work of a Member of the Oireachtas, was not gravely affected by the enormous amount of time and commitment given to the work of the sub-committee inquiry into DIRT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts is present because the committee, its chairman and all its members, particularly those of the sub-committee, are to be commended by the House and by the country as a whole for the expeditious manner in which they handled the DIRT inquiry. Comparison between the expeditious and economical manner in which the Committee of Public Accounts conducted its business must be made with the languid, ruinously expensive and in many ways interminable operations of the tribunals appointed in recent years. I was amused by the recent public outcry at the statements of the Taxing Master, Mr. Flynn, in this regard because many of the views he expressed publicly have been expressed privately around the corridors of this House. However, I suppose he committed one of the sins of modern Irish life, he expressed with some candour what he felt &ndash; political correctness always demands otherwise.</P>
      <P>The committee, its chairman and the sub-committee are to be complimented on a wonderful job. Their report did this country a considerable service. It also did this House and politics a considerable service. The report was important in four major respects. It showed that a parliamentary committee could function within the system. Moreover, it showed that a parliamentary committee could function in a sensitive way and could deal with an area which is complex, difficult and requires detailed work. In many respects, this marks a watershed. The work of the committee marks a critical departure point in the life of politics in this country, particularly in the manner in which parliamentary business is conducted in this and the other House.</P>
      <P>For many years there have been arguments about the role parliamentary committees could play within the system. There have been questions as to whether parliamentary committees could deal with these complex issues. This sub-committee dealt with a very complex issue. There have been arguments that the willingness and partisan nature of politics is such that a committee could not handle political hot potatoes. This sub-committee dealt with an issue in a markedly non-partisan manner. It dealt with an issue which could have become an exercise in finger-pointing and futile political blame-laying. This did not happen. It has also been suggested that committees did not have the capacity to produce meaningful reports. That is a nonsense; it is mendacious. We all know committees of both Houses can produce well focused reports that contain a wealth of good advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> The report of the committee also proved that a committee can work not only in a timely but extraordinarily inexpensive manner. Deputy McCormack made the point that the overall costs of the committee were less than £830,000. In reality, the cost is in the order of £600,000, which is nothing when compared to the fees paid not just in the case of the two ongoing tribunals, but in the case of the tribunal into the beef industry. That extraordinary tribunal went on interminably and produced results, but I guarantee if one asked 99% of the Members of this House to outline the ten major issues in that report, they would be stumped after five. This sub-committee has done us all a service, it has done politics a service and has proven that parliamentary committees can work well.</P>
    <P>The committee illustrates something I have suspected and spoken about on more than one occasion. There is a serious problem in the banking and financial services sector in this country. There has been a rather club-like atmosphere between the banks, the financial institutions and the controlling institution. The Central Bank does not come out well from this inquiry and, more importantly, neither do the commercial banks. The report reflects little credit on many of the commercial banks, including the State-owned ACC.</P>
    <P>The report shows up the AIB in particular in an utterly shameful manner. Its performance in this issue has been reprehensible and I have not heard one utterance of apology to the public. The people, not very long ago through their taxes, stood by that banking group when it was in difficulty with a major insurance corporation acquisition. It was bailed out by the taxpayers and by other bank users. That company went from strength to strength after that debacle. It owes a debt of gratitude to the people, which it has repaid in a very bad way. When one reads through this excellent report, one cannot but conclude that white collar crime of a high order was endorsed institutionally in some of the banking institutions. Moreover, one cannot but conclude that the oversight agency, the Central Bank, if not turning a blind eye, was certainly not wide awake. The reality is that there was widescale knowledge in this State about what was happening in regard to DIRT. It was not just a minor episode, it was something which was institutionally grounded throughout the financial institutions. Thousands of people must have known at an institutional level what was happening and, of course, hundreds of thousands of people in the public knew what was happening.</P>
    <P>The report also illustrates in a graphic manner how a wide spectrum of the Irish public, once respected, institutions, a wide spectrum of professional bodies and professionals were willing to behave in the matter of taxes. A motto over the IRS building in Washington reads, &ldquo;Taxes are the <Col N="309" /> price you pay for a just society&rdquo;. It is extraordinary that so many people in Ireland &ndash; there were more than 200,000 accounts, a high proportion of which were fraudulent &ndash; were willing not just to dodge, but to fraudulently avoid paying the costs of living in a just society. There has been much cynicism in recent years about standards in political life. A great deal of that cynicism has been deserved in specific cases because some of the revelations about political life would make anyone who cares about democracy or politics cringe. However, the reality is that low standards did not just exist in political life, they existed in the Irish banking industry and in some of the major banking institutions. A cavalier attitude to standards existed in the financial oversight agency, and within the general public there was a willingness on the widest scale to avoid paying taxes.</P>
    <P>The banking industry and professionals in a wide spectrum of society participated willingly in this fraud. That is very evident if one reads this report. Another issue that is clear from reading the report, considering the response in the past few months, is the willingness of people to move on without learning the lesson. I find that disturbing. It is disturbing that there has not been a more incited analysis into what this says about modern Irish society. I find it extremely embarrassing that there has not been an apology from the institutions involved. It is difficult to comprehend why the professional bodies, some of which have been trying to put their houses in order, have been less forthcoming in instituting a debate on what this report illustrates about Irish society. Deputy Jim Mitchell and his committee held up a mirror to Irish society and the image reflected is not a good or handsome one.</P>
    <P>A fourth point in this report which gravely concerns me is what it has to say about the accountability of State-sponsored bodies. Since the foundation of the State we have set up a variety of State-sponsored bodies, commercial and non-commercial, and we have not, at an institutional level, paid anything like sufficient attention to the control mechanisms which are allowed to operate in a free-wheeling fashion to link those to public accountability. This is an issue that interests me academically as well as politically. I recall a few years ago when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies produced report after report and at the core of many of those reports were issues about the reporting and control relationships between parent Departments and the State-sponsored bodies. To say the least, the good work of that committee was ignored and in many cases cynically disregarded. In some cases it was resented. I remember one or two senior executives in State-sponsored bodies reacting in a way which was negative in the extreme. The control mechanism that exists between the State-sponsored bodies and the parent Departments and, more importantly, the control relationship <Col N="310" /> that exists between the State-sponsored bodies and this House is called into question. I shall return to that issue if time permits.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate to date on this report is focused on the facts contained in the report and, in particular, on the role of the banks. Other than the comments I have already made about the banks and the low standards which they have been willing to apply and the fraudulent standards which they have forced their staff to apply, I do not intend to say anything further on that issue. I want instead to focus on the institutional implications.</P>
    <P>The report illustrates in an important way the capacity of Oireachtas committees to do work which is complex, tedious and painstaking. The potential for committees has only recently begun to be realised and to be appreciated. For many years committees of the Dáil and Seanad have not been well focused. They were cumbersome and were generally regarded as having nuisance value. Members looked at the time given to committees as a distraction. I remember being warned if I paid too much time to membership of a committee that I would inevitably endanger my Dáil seat.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been exceptions to the rather negative image of the committees. The Committee of Public Accounts, under the current chairman and previous chairmen, has been a glowing example of a good committee doing good work and producing value for money. The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies produced 16 or 17 excellent reports during its life. The Joint Committee on European Affairs does very good work in scrutinising a whole volume of secondary legislation which arose from EU membership. Those have been exceptions.</P>
    <P>The reforms introduced in the last two Dála have meant that the committee system has begun to play a more meaningful role. The problem is that there is an unwillingness among Members of this and the other House to accept we can play a meaningful role. A lack of confidence in our own capacity prevents those committees from rising to the true standards they could reach. This report is welcome because it shows to every committee just how much can be done.</P>
    <P>The report illustrates just how meaningful a role the committee system can play. There are, however, still problems in joint committees that have to be resolved. The committees are grossly under-resourced, even the Committee of Public Accounts which has, effectively, a constitutional status. The chairman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, has made that point on several occasions and I have made that point as chairman of other committees. When we argue the case for more resources we have to argue it with the Department of Finance. The amount of money available to all Oireachtas committees for consultancy is ludicrous. No parliament in the world would accept that the <Col N="311" /> National Treasury Management Agency should manage how it goes about its business. I would argue that the treasury oversight which exists in this House and the manner in which it impedes parliamentary committees is of dubious constitutional standing.</P>
    <P>There are also staff problems. We have few staff from whom we can draw. It should be possible for us to draw staff into the committees from the widest range of the public service. A period spent servicing a Dáil or Seanad committee or a joint committee should be regarded as a positive step forward in a young public servant's career. It should be possible for the committees to second people from the world of business, commerce and academia. There is also the problem of accommodation. Even when the new block is built there will not be sufficient room to physically accommodate committee work. The research and other back-up available to committees is remarkably lacking. The IT cost of this report at £200,000 plus was not wasted or spent on a once-off project but is an investment in the whole parliamentary system and in democracy.</P>
    <P>Members of committees have a difficulty in allocating their time. This point has been referred to time and again by Members. I accept there will be no reform of Dáil committees without reform of the electoral system. Our electoral system begets constituency slaves. It does not deliver parliamentarians. It may well be that that is what the people want. All the opinion polls, from the original MRBI polls at the end of the 1970s to date, show the issue most favoured by the people when they put No. 1 on the ballot paper is constituency service. There is something fundamentally wrong in a modern democratic developed State where people are of the view that the only way they can get those services to which they are entitled is by going cap in hand to their TDs, Senators and public representatives. In this regard electoral reform and parliamentary reform are intimately inter-connected with reform of the public service system.</P>
    <P>In his response the Minister indicated his personal concerns at the manner in which the ACC handled its affairs and the way in which the board was able to keep the Minister abreast of what was happening. The board was not able to keep the Minister abreast of what was happening. That is a fundamental breakdown. The role of the board and the chairman of a State-sponsored body has been prescribed since 1927. The board and the chairman of a State-sponsored body are meant to be the bridge between the State-sponsored body and the Minister. They are meant to be the guardians of the public interest and in this case there was a serious breakdown.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Jim Mitchell and his committee. It is a sign of how poorly we take this issue that this long-awaited debate is poorly <Col N="312" /> attended by the ladies and gentlemen of the media who frequently tell us about our failings.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Jim Mitchell and his team on their outstanding work. I was hoping Deputy Mitchell would not be present today because it is always difficult to praise someone in his presence. During the hearings he suffered from a back complaint. It is difficult to do good work when one is in the best of health but the fact that he worked so well and so incisively when suffering from a complaint of that sort speaks volumes for Deputy Mitchell. He drove the process forward. He was dedicated, he took no nonsense and got the best out of his team and the staff of the Houses. The staff were absolutely brilliant.</P>
      <P>The DIRT inquiry shows what can be achieved in the House. The report recommends Oireachtas reform which is needed. I agree with Deputy Roche in this regard. I have always advocated a change in the electoral system and we need this urgently. Many Deputies would hesitate to become members of a sub-committee of this nature, involving a huge volume of work, because by doing so they would neglect their constituencies. Deputies do not have sufficient back-up, even to do their ordinary work. I have enormous sympathy for the members of the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee. While the sub-committee sat, each day was taken up with its very important work and members cannot have had an opportunity to deal with constituency matters.</P>
      <P>We need a change in the electoral system, as is proposed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. I am not sure if the Minister will receive the support of his parliamentary colleagues for this reform or if he is merely flying a kite. If we are to be parliamentarians and legislators we should be elected to do that job and not on the basis of the number of doors we have knocked on, how many leaflets we have delivered and how many favours we have bestowed. Our current system is demeaning but we comply with it because it is the only way to be elected.</P>
      <P>The DIRT inquiry shows what can be attained. The questioning by the members was incisive. The television coverage was particularly welcome. It allowed us to see that our Deputies could elicit the truth from the best brains among the witnesses. I commend TG4 for televising the hearings. It is regrettable that our tribunals are not televised. This would be a relatively simple matter. The format of the inquiry with people sitting around a table was good. The stuffy and off-putting adversarial system which we see in our courts was not used. When members and witnesses sat around a table questions were thrown and the Deputies got down to the nitty-gritty, and this helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The recommendations in the report, including Oireachtas reform, must be followed up. The Attorney General has been asked to examine the methods of holding tribunals and inquiries in other countries. We must make those comparisons. This work will require huge investment. Deputy Roche has referred to AIB. Members of this House have very little back-up or remuneration. When an increase in remuneration is contemplated we must go to the review body which is headed by Mr. Buckley of AIB who is paid £500,000 per year and who tells us what we can and cannot earn. When I consider the history of AIB this sticks in my craw. As Members of the Oireachtas we must respect ourselves. We need greater investment in the Houses and greater back-up. The Minister for Finance must learn from the inquiry and act on the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee's method of carrying out its business, particularly its use of section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Act, 1923, was quite innovative. This showed how quickly legislation can be put into effect. The legislative changes took only eight weeks. This was due to the stewardship of the chairman.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the central findings of the sub-committee. We need a new consolidated Revenue Act. There have been complaints from the IFSC that the Revenue Commissioners are being over-zealous. I would prefer to see them over-zealous than too lax in carrying out their duties. The report makes it clear that there was laxity in the past.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people who watched the proceedings on television had nothing but praise for the sub-committee. However, I am continually asked what punishment will be meted out to those involved and I can only answer that I do not know. Many of those involved will probably escape punishment and this is regrettable and disappointing. It is not what the public wants to hear. The public wants to see action taken and people punished.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that while the financial institutions are perceived to have conspired in tax evasion and are branded as corrupt, this view is too simplistic. I do not agree with him. I believe that is the plain and unvarnished truth. It was also said that the laxity of the public authorities was at fault rather than endemic corruption. One can only conclude from the report that corruption and tax evasion were endemic in the country. Bogus non-resident accounts were held in various towns throughout the country. This is an indictment of ourselves. I was asked recently why we are such a dirty nation and why we have such a litter problem. I was reluctant to agree that this was the result of something in the Irish psyche. However there is something in the Irish psyche which believes that laws should not be obeyed if one can get away with not obeying them. We <Col N="314" /> have an individualistic streak which leads us to admire a person who can get away with breaking the law. We suffered the final indignity when it emerged that a member of the sub-committee was an Ansbacher account holder. This did not damage the findings of the sub-committee but it did great damage in terms of public perception and was very regrettable. This happened despite the fact that a screening procedure was in place and questions were put to this individual. In future we must examine in detail Members who are being appointed to committees and we must also find ways of dealing with those who bring committees into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The inquiry has been a welcome exercise. It has exposed corruption in our society. However, we must ask ourselves is anyone who was involved in this corruption feeling uneasy at the prospect of being prosecuted. I do not think so. Let us look at what has happened since. Certain politicians in this House have been found guilty of certain activities and gone on to top the poll. This says something about the Irish psyche. Deputy Foley need not worry therefore about his political future; he will do quite well.</P>
    <P>In terms of cleaning up the political and financial systems this has been a very productive committee, which has done us proud. The inquiry is now suspended but I hope we will learn from the mistakes made, which were few. The central message is that this House needs more investment. The inquiry cost just over £800,000, which is nothing when compared to the cost of the tribunals, in respect of which there is great cynicism among the public about the length of time being taken up. Many see them simply as offering a sinecure to certain individuals. Some, however, are doing fantastic work, although the people were disappointed with the beef tribunal. What was good about this inquiry was that its findings were so clear. There is a need for clarity when it comes to tribunals of inquiry. To do our work effectively we need to follow through on the report's recommendations and treat ourselves with more respect. To this end there is a need for investment and resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues on the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts on the work they did so effectively and expeditiously and to which they had to devote considerable time without any form of remuneration in contrast with some of the others involved in advising some of the parties. I cannot help contrasting the speed, clarity and effectiveness of the report with what happened at the beef tribunal in the manner of the hearings and the nature of the report, which was shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report some very serious findings have been made, primarily in relation to banks but also <Col N="315" /> in relation to the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. The findings in regard to certain external auditors are quite startling. I will deal in some detail with that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>This report is a watershed in relations between Parliament and Government. This relationship in which Parliament is supposed to be supreme has been clouded in recent decades by the growth of Executive power and the decline of parliamentary power and accountability. The sub-committee is right to draw attention in its report to the need for parliamentary reform, particularly in the fields of parliamentary questions, transparency, accountability and investigation. The consequences of the Haughey case in 1971 were very serious because they stultified effective parliamentary inquiries for nearly 30 years.</P>
    <P>The close relationship between agencies of the State and major economic interests as exemplified in the report is disturbing and should be terminated. I hope this year will see the introduction of the various legislative and other administrative changes for which the report clearly calls. I am glad this work has already started in the Finance Act and the various steps taken by the Tánaiste in particular.</P>
    <P>The findings of the report point to a need to raise standards, not just in the banking sphere but across a wide range of business and professional activities. Sadly, the findings of the Committee of Public Accounts are confirmed daily by what is being brought to light in various tribunals and the inquiries undertaken at the instigation of the Tánaiste. Raising these standards either by way of improved, transparent and credible self-regulation on the part of professional bodies, or by way of new legislation which is effectively enforced, is as important to sustaining our prosperity as lowering taxes and increasing competition.</P>
    <P>In a fast moving and increasingly competitive global environment we will only continue to attract high quality investment if we conduct our business affairs in a manner which is above reproach. I have considerable experience in promoting investment worldwide and I am clear that while investors do not want petty bureaucratic red tape, they will favour those countries which have a clear, straightforward legal and regulatory structure which is enforced without fear or favour. Such a regime thus attracts the best type of investment and creates a stable prosperity where people need not be concerned about the threat, either real or illusory, of capital flight. Such a regime is also necessary to sustain the reduction in tax rates to which my party and I are committed. People wish to see effort and innovation rewarded provided that they are sure that the money is made from legitimate business activity and people pay what is lawfully due in taxes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> During the past year or so, in addition to the problems highlighted in the report, there has been a steady flow of complaints from members of the public who have been unhappy with the investigation by the recognised accountancy bodies of complaints made against their members. As a result of the issues raised the accounting bodies need to give greater recognition to the following elements of their investigation and disciplinary regime: (i) transparency &ndash; investigation or disciplinary findings should always be published; (ii) the standing of the complainant &ndash; his or her rights are often less than the member's in the process of investigation and this imbalance needs to be corrected, and (iii) independence &ndash; greater participation by independent persons in the decision-making structures needs to be provided for in order to provide public assurance of the fairness of the investigation and disciplinary regime.</P>
    <P>While such steps would be welcome, there is also a clear need for an overall review of auditing. In this connection I welcome the decision of the Tánaiste late last year to establish a review group on auditing under the chairmanship of Senator Joe O'Toole which is due to report by the end of May. It will examine and report on various issues dealing with auditor independence, the auditing of financial institutions and legislative changes recommended in the DIRT inquiry report. In addition, having regard to recent developments, it has been asked to examine whether self-regulation in the auditing profession has been working effectively and consistently and whether any new or revised structures and arrangements are necessary to improve public confidence and, if so, what form they should take. I am sure the group, under the able chairmanship of Senator O'Toole, will come up with practical recommendations which can be implemented speedily.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the need for these changes to be made quickly. When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce in the early 1990s certain matters came to my attention and I invited the then chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland to discuss these concerns which were of a disciplinary nature relating to his members. In the course of the discussion I asked him when was the last time a chartered accountant had been struck off or how many had been struck off in the previous ten years, and he told me that he could not give me the answer off the top of his head but that he would communicate with me in a day or two, which he did. It transpired that one accountant had been struck off in the previous ten years. His was a small, one man practice in a small town in a remote part of Ireland. When I inquired about him, I discovered that he had a drink problem and he had lost control of his practice. That was the extent of the disciplinary action taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> At that time I was aware from the evidence given to the beef tribunal, for example, of serious dereliction of duty by auditors, but no action was taken in that case. Some of it has been made clear in that evidence. While I do not rely on the beef tribunal report or its findings, it is convenient for the purpose of quotation to refer to some of what came to light in the course of that tribunal. There were serious instances of major tax evasion by a particular beef company and it was clear from the evidence that that evasion had come to the knowledge of the company's external auditors. The rules of conduct for auditors include rule 24, that &ldquo;a member should not continue acting for his client while suspicious of his conduct&rdquo;. In this case, of course, the firm concerned continued to act for the client and continued to facilitate and connive at major serious tax evasion amounting to many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>This morning I inquired from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is seized of these matters, whether the accountancy profession or institutions had taken any steps of a disciplinary nature arising out of the beef tribunal against any of its members and I was told the answer was no, they had not taken any steps. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The auditing function is one which has become increasingly less important in the minds of some of these larger firms. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, which is the primary institute of this nature, tends to be dominated by a small number of very large firms situated in Dublin 2. It appears that because they dominate the institute they seem to be exempt from any form of effective control, whatever the lip-service may be at a given time.</P>
    <P>Part of the serious difficulty which has now emerged arises from the combination of auditing and consultancy advice. The consultancy advice is frequently extremely lucrative from the firms' point of view. I am told that in some cases auditing, which is a statutory procedure for the protection of the public and shareholders, is looked on by these firms as a kind of loss leader so that they can get their leg in the door and make a great deal of money from the consultancy side of their activities. I hope that the review group set up by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and chaired by Senator O'Toole will come to grips with that problem.</P>
    <P>I have read the long list of recommendations by the sub-committee under Deputy Mitchell and I find myself in agreement with them. The great majority of them should be taken on board and if there is not proper self-regulation in the auditing profession, it must be imposed by legislation. If that is necessary, I hope that that legislation will be introduced before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to disagree with any of the recommendations of the sub-committee in this regard. The recommendation, for example, that an audi<Col N="318" /> tor should be allowed a maximum term of five years to audit a financial institution is correct. That will give rise to a much greater degree of independence. In addition, the auditor to a financial institution should be appointed not by the institution itself but by the Central Bank. The auditor, therefore, would be in no way beholden to the institution and could operate effectively and independently. Some of the other recommendations hint at some of the other difficulties which seem to exist, but these are among the more serious ones and I hope they will now be tackled in an effective way.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this report and other reports that it is not just professional bodies which need to get their house in order. It is also necessary that the State examines its own conscience and ensures that legislation is appropriate and properly enforced. I welcome the new powers given to the Revenue Commissioners in the Finance Bill and I hope that the Government will respond positively to the other recommendations without undue delay. However, there is a need to act in other areas also.</P>
    <P>The report of the Company Law Compliance and Enforcement Working Group, established by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1998, only served to confirm our worst fears about the low level of compliance with the most straightforward filing requirements in company law. It was also made clear in the report that appropriate resources had never been made available by the State to ensure that company law was properly enforced in Ireland. The group concluded that those who were tempted to undertake serious breaches of company law, of whom there are many, had little reason to fear detection or prosecution.</P>
    <P>The working group made a number of detailed recommendations for changes in company law and in the manner in which it is enforced. The Government responded positively to these recommendations and I understand that the heads of a Bill which are necessary to give legislative effect to these recommendations have been drafted. I understand that the Bill will be published in May and I hope that it will get a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals of the working group was the establishment of a new office of director of corporate enforcement. I welcome the fact that the Government went beyond the recommendation of the working group and decided to transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the new director primary responsibility for company law investigations. The director will lead a multi-disciplined team, comprising staff with legal, accounting, administrative and criminal investigative expertise. This team will have the necessary skills required to investigate adequately suspected instances of corporate fraud and malpractice and, where evi<Col N="319" /> dence of such is found, to prepare cases for the prosecution of offenders.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a company law review group was a key recommendation of the McDowell report. The company law review group, which has been established, will play the lead role in ensuring that Ireland has a company law code which embodies best practice for the development and regulation of the corporate area.</P>
    <P>The work of the Committee of Public Accounts on this report illustrates what can be achieved by a committee of this House when it acts with determination. The report already has a positive effect in bringing about the changes which are needed if we are to move to being a fully developed true democracy of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members, including the Minister, who contributed to the debate and who expressed kind sentiments about me and the sub-committee.</P>
      <P>By their nature inquiries look at negative issues, but a hallmark of my approach in public life, and in life in general, has been to dwell on the positive and not excessively dwell on the negative. We have had enough negatives in the sense that we have had calls for so many tribunals in recent years. There is among people a widespread view that politics and society are corrupt, whereas in reality, and without being complacent, we have a society which compares to the best in the world. What has been happening in recent years is good in the sense that wrongdoers are being exposed, but because a small number of wrongdoers are being exposed we should not extrapolate and say that the generality of politicians or people are corrupt, something I do not believe to be the case.</P>
      <P>We should be terrier like and determined in exposing wrongdoing wherever it occurs. It is particularly apt that the final speaker was Deputy O'Malley who has been one of the great terriers of accountability in the House for so long. I am happy to seek to emulate his efforts over so many years.</P>
      <P>It was in that context that I expressed the view today and previously that there was not endemic corruption, something which was criticised by Deputy Gormley. I do not believe anybody who sees or examines the evidence will believe there was endemic corruption in any of the public services or financial institutions. Because of what I call laxity, bad habits were allowed prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley went on to talk about the litter problem, another classic case of public sector laxity &ndash; it is a management problem. The major private shopping centres, which are used by tens of thousands of people, are spotlessly clean. The litter problem in a sense is similar to the DIRT problem. Because of the lack of provision and <Col N="320" /> political will in terms of enforcement, the problem was allowed fester. Sometimes this comes from the belief that people do not want enforcement. However, all the evidence is that people want enforcement. Let us take the example of clamping vehicles in Dublin. There was initial criticism, but now people are delighted with it because it has certainly improved parking in the city. Similarly, people want effective Government. When the Government eventually addressed the public finances problems in 1987, with the assistance of the Opposition, its popularity increased. Contrary to all expectation the Government was popular for cutting expenditure and for doing what was right and necessary. This is the approach we should have to all these issues as we have a duty to lead and be sensible and effective.</P>
    <P>The House is not effective. We are a shambles, appallingly organised and resourced and not independent of the Executive as we should be. The Minister's response today was excellent in all respects bar one. I do not agree with the criticism expressed about the Department of Finance. That Department co-operated with the inquiry from the outset in the most positive way under the leadership of the now retired Secretary General and his successor. Similarly the office of the Attorney General has been positive in its response from the word go. The Revenue Commissioners have also reacted positively from the word go, so there has not been resistance to the inquiry only full co-operation, something which is worth repeating. The one area where there seems to be very little progress is where progress is most urgently needed, namely, getting our act together in this House. We are surrounded by empty chairs, which is the norm, and that is what the public sees on television, adding to cynicism about politics. It is corrosive, debilitating and dangerous. It is necessary to address the conclusions in the report which seek urgent Oireachtas reform, including making the Houses of the Oireachtas financially independent as is the case in most other jurisdictions so that we do not have to return to the Executive for approval for expenditure on all sorts of minor things leading to the possibility of things being delayed and frustrated. It is wrong that we should have to do this. We should have the independence and resources necessary to decide the priorities.</P>
    <P>Resources is a major issue. One of the great things in this inquiry is that we received the resources, both individually and as a committee. That the Minister for Finance approved a personal assistant for each Member to help them in their research and reading was an absolute Godsend. The inquiry could not have continued at the pace it did but for that because when we finished at 10 o'clock at night those people read the files for the next day and were able to brief us fully <Col N="321" /> early the next morning so that we were ready to ask the probing and relevant questions.</P>
    <P>This House meets at the same time as two or three committees and parliamentary party meetings. Deputies are running backwards and forwards to be present or raise a question. I know of no other Parliament which operates in this way. For five years I was a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe where committees never sat at the same time as the plenary session of Parliament, and we should get to that stage. Question Time has become a charade because of well meaning changes over the years which have effectively deadened what was once the great tool of parliamentary accountability. Opposition Members are not properly resourced to do their research to hold Ministers to account. Chairpersons and Members of committees are not properly resourced to do their work. There is much we can do and if we do it there will be lasting benefit to the public administration and people of the country. What is more, Government will benefit. A Minister who thinks it is wise to avoid or duck accountability and not answer questions in the House is undermining his own power and authority in his Department. It is the road to failure.</P>
    <P>There are many people whom we should thank. I already expressed my thanks to the clerk of the committee and the Ceann Comhairle and Clerk of the Dáil and all the other staff of the House who were magnificent. We were extremely well assisted by the Bar Council from the outset. Mr. Frank Clarke, SC, was nominated by the Bar Council to act <i>pro bono publico</i> which he did for the first several weeks. He was later assisted by Mary Irvine, SC, and Paul Gilligan, SC, who were very wise and committed counsels to the committee. We are extremely grateful to them and to the junior counsel, Emily Egan and Emily Farrell, who did so much good work on the avalanche of documentation. Our financial advisers, Eugene McMahon, a partner of Chapman Flood Mazars, and his assistant, Mark Kennedy, were incredibly effective and committed, working extraordinarily long hours. In addition, my staff, in particular Noreen Flynn, my personal secretary, and P. J. O'Meara, my personal assistant, both of whom were an incredible help to me throughout the inquiry; Larry Byrne, the liaison officer, and the research staff under Tony Carberry, Pauline O'Dwyer and Eamon O'Halloran were brilliant, as was the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.</P>
    <P>The work will not be completed unless and until we, in this House, urgently adopt the Oireachtas reform proposals which are such an intrinsic part of this report.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to decentralise Government Departments; the number of public servants who will be affected by these plans; the regional locations proposed for decentralised Departments and agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9370/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): In my Budget Statement I outlined the Government's intention to proceed with a further round of decentralisation which will involve, for the first time, the non-commercial semi-State sector. In the reviewed An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government had previously reiterated its commitment to a policy of balanced regional development and set the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas as a key priority.</P>
    <P>Since my budget day announcement I have initiated a process of consultation with my Government colleagues with a view to taking decisions on a significant programme of decentralisation by the summer. I am on record as saying that a new programme of decentralisation could include as many as 10,000 civil and public servants. While I appreciate that this is an ambitious target I see it as an entirely achievable one. However, I am aware that there are certain constraints which may ultimately impact on the numbers to be included in the new programme. Until the consultative process, which I recently initiated, has concluded and the Government has taken its decisions, it is difficult to state definitively the numbers which will be decentralised under the forthcoming programme.</P>
    <P>As part of the process currently under way careful consideration is being given to the selection of the centres to which Departments, offices and agencies will be relocated. I have received and continue to receive a significant amount of correspondence on the subject and it is clear that there is considerable interest throughout the country in the issue. I reiterate that in advance of the Government's deliberations, it is premature for me to comment on the likelihood of the inclusion of any particular centre in the new programme. However, in that regard I reassure those who have corresponded with me that all the centres suggested for inclusion, and some which have not, will be fully considered before any decisions are taken by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Government, the centres to which public sector agencies were decentralised seem to have been decided on the basis of which constituencies were represented by <Col N="323" /> a Cabinet Minister. Will this continue to be the procedure or has the Minister set down objective criteria for the selection of locations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A few bodies were relocated over recent years as a result of specific items on the Government agenda. For example, recently in the context of the proposals in the White Paper on Defence, a small number of Civil Defence workers were relocated to Tipperary while with regard to the Government's proposal for Campus Ireland and the new sports stadium, it was necessary to relocate a number of staff to Abbotstown. We are embarking on a major programme of decentralisation and all areas will be considered to ensure balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Every part of the country is likely to be considered, regardless of whether it is represented by a Cabinet Minister. As the Deputy will be aware, following his term as Minister during the previous Administration, that criterion came very much into consideration when, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency was relocated to County Wexford, the home of the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and a large section of the Department of Agriculture and Food was also transferred to County Wexford, the home of the then Minister for Agriculture and Food. I am sure no such considerations will ever enter my mind.</P>

Approximately 29,500 civil servants and 2,500 public servants will be involved. When the current round of decentralisation is completed, up to 14,000 people will have relocated from Dublin. Some Departments have been very good at decentralising their staff. I hope to achieve a figure of up to 10,000 and when that <Col N="324" /> is achieved the bulk of civil and public servants will work outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>In response to questions in the House on 15 February and 23 February 2000, I indicated that it would not be appropriate for me to make any statement on matters which are currently the subject of examination by the Moriarty tribunal. I further indicated that I had been informed by the Central Bank that it expected to be giving evidence to the tribunal shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Moriarty tribunal commenced the taking of evidence in public sittings from Central Bank witnesses on 7 March 2000 in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, the operation of the Ansbacher accounts. I am not in a position to say whether the taking of evidence from Central Bank witnesses has concluded. However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that additional information has been sought by the tribunal and, therefore, the taking of further evidence cannot be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot make any comment on matters which are under examination by the tribunal, which was established by resolution of the Oireachtas to inquire into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil on certain matters. However, now that the Cen<Col N="325" /> tral Bank has given evidence to the tribunal as to its state of knowledge of the system of numbered offshore deposit accounts, known as the Ansbacher deposits, I am in a position to inform the Deputy that the Governor wrote to me, at his own initiative, on 9 February 2000 on this issue. This was prompted by an editorial which appeared in<i> The Irish Times</i> on 7 February 2000. I understand that a copy of this letter was provided to the Moriarty tribunal by the Central Bank. The letter states:</P>
    <P>9 February 2000</P>

    <P>Minister for Finance</P>
    <P>Government Buildings</P>
    <P>Upper Merrion Street</P>
    <P>Dublin 2</P>
    <P>Dear Minister</P>
    <P>I refer to Monday's editorial in the Irish Times which contains a number of seriously inaccurate and misconceived statements relating to the Central Bank, including a reference to an apparent failure of the Bank to &ldquo;inform the Minister . . . and through him the Dáil that it had knowledge of [certain] banking practices . . .&rdquo;. In order to avoid any further misconception about the disclosure of information, I would like to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>You wrote to me in October 1997 in relation to the findings of the McCracken Tribunal requesting an examination of the McCracken Report and a comment on the Board's view of the adequacy of the supervisory and regulatory statutes and procedures and their implementation. This Report covered the period January 1986 to December 1996.</P>
    <P>As your letter asked that we specifically examine references to supervision in the McCracken Report, we felt it would be helpful to reply at length on the supervisory issues which were referred to in the Report and we did so under a waiver from Guinness &amp; Mahon of the normal confidentiality requirements. This allowed us to discuss fully the issues which arose in the McCracken Report, namely breaches by G&amp;M of our Licensing and Supervision Requirements and Standards relating to large liabilities to interbank depositors and to matters relating to the control and management of G&amp;M.</P>
    <P>In the reply I indicated that the system for operating the Ansbacher accounts referred to in the McCracken Report was not known to the Central Bank. These accounts were not part of the G&amp;M accounting system and could not, therefore, be detected by the supervisory process. The Bank learnt of the existence of these accounts for the first time through the McCracken Report.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty Tribunal was established in September 1997. The Central Bank has had fre<Col N="326" /> quent contacts with the Tribunal in relation to both exchange control and supervisory matters. In consideration of the Terms of Reference, the Bank made a submission to the Tribunal in December 1997. This covered the period of the McCracken Report. In addition, it included a separate section on some issues arising prior to that period which were considered by the Bank to be relevant to the work of the Tribunal. The material in this section related to matters which arose during the course of on-site inspections of G&amp;M carried out by the Bank in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the Central Bank had no knowledge of the system of numbered offshore deposit accounts known as the &ldquo;Ansbacher deposits&rdquo;. These appear to have been deliberately concealed and were maintained outside the normal books and records of G&amp;M.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's anxiety at all times throughout the various investigations of these matters has been to assist the relevant bodies established by the Oireachtas, in every possible way. To this end, evidence has been provided continuously, and up to the present moment, to the Moriarty Tribunal and the Bank expects to give further detailed evidence to the Tribunal shortly. As you are aware, Section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, imposes strict requirements of secrecy in relation to supervisory matters. Within this constraint, we have ensured that all relevant information has been brought forward.</P>
    <P>Please contact me if you require any further information.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Maurice O'Connell.</P>
    <P>In the light of this letter, the question of asking the board of the Central Bank for an explanation of the content of the letter dated 11 November 1997 from the Governor, which I read into the record of the House on 19 November 1997, did not arise.</P>

      <P>I have to confess I am completely bewildered by the response and particularly by the contents of the letter from the Governor. It does not seem to address the information that has since come to light at the tribunal. I appreciate what you are going to say, a Cheann Comhairle, in ruling me out of order, and perhaps this is something we need to pursue further elsewhere. Is the Minister satisfied, given the letter he has just read into the record of the House, that that sits comfortably with the information he has previously been given by the Governor in relation to the bank's stated knowledge about the Ansbacher accounts or what we now know to be the Ansbacher accounts? Is the Minister satisfied that he has not inadvertently misled the House?</P>

      <P>I have not misled the House because I read into the record what was sent to me. The Deputy and other Deputies tabled parliamentary questions previously on this matter and I took advice from the Attorney General's office as to what would be appropriate. The advice from the Attorney General's office is that it would be inappropriate for the Minster to seek to clarify or explain the Central Bank's position or to appear to be taking sides. He should be careful not to intrude on the tribunal's terms of reference, although there was other advice as well. The Central Bank has been at the tribunal since the last parliamentary question and it may be there again, so we should wait to hear the final deliberations of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says about the tribunal, and obviously we must not trespass upon that, but I am seeking to establish whether the Minister, in reading into the record the Governor's response in November 1997, gave what is now in effect inaccurate information or whether he is satisfied that the information he transmitted, albeit by way of reading out a letter, was accurate at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My legal advice is that it would not be appropriate to enter into discussion on the distinction. The nub of the issue is as follows: the Central Bank distinguishes between, on the one hand, the system of numbered offshore accounts, known as the Ansbacher deposits; the Central Bank has stated that these accounts appear to have been deliberately concealed and were not part of the G&amp;M accounting system; and the Central Bank has reiterated that it learned of the existence of these accounts for the first time through the McCracken report. On the other hand, in respect of the issues which arose in the course of on-site inspections by the Central Bank in 1976 and 1978 concerning back to back loans secured by offshore deposits, it would seem that these activities formed part of the G&amp;M accounting system and from the Governor's letter of 9 February 2000 it would appear that the term &ldquo;Ansbacher accounts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ansbacher deposits&rdquo;, as used in the Governor's letter dated 11 November 1997, was not intended to cover these accounts. My advice is that it would not be appropriate to enter into discussion on this distinction as this is a matter for the tribunal.</P>

The chairman recommended a certain amount of tax-free savings for credit unions as follows: a continuation of the corporation tax exemption for credit unions; the first £375 of credit union members' dividend income to be exempt from tax; any excess of dividends over £375 up to £750 to be subject to 20% tax; where dividends are over £750, the entire dividend to be taxed at 20%; all interest on deposits to be taxed at the 20% DIRT rate; no reporting of dividends or interest by credit unions to Revenue.</P>
      <P>One cannot ignore the risk of tax evasion where there are non-reportable tax free accounts in certain institutions. This issue has come to light in recent times, most notably in the Committee of Public Accounts report into DIRT, and it has been shown that when a certain level of interest income was exempt from tax in the past, a serious problem of tax evasion arose through the use of multiple accounts in different banks and branches and/or in different names, including those of relations and children. There is also general equity aspects which must be considered in relation to all financial institutions and any concessions given to credit union savers would inevitably lead to demands by corresponding savers with other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is also the issue of the complaint which has been made to the European Commission by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. This complaint relates to the current tax treatment of credit unions and their exemption from corporation tax and from DIRT. In 1998 the Commission dealt with a complaint regarding the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions. The European Commission decided not to regard this exemption as a State aid. A key consideration which influenced its decision is that the dividends currently paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. If both the credit union and its members were exempt from taxation, on the basis proposed by the league, such a proposal would have to be referred to the Commission for clearance. The Commission is dealing with the existing tax position of credit unions. If the existing position has triggered a complaint, it would be reasonable to assume that further concessions, as sought by the credit union movement, would trigger further complaints which would have to be dealt with also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste met the league on 24 February last. At this meeting the league accepted the Government's position that complaints on taxation made to the European Commission must be resolved before any further moves are made in regard to the taxation of cre<Col N="329" /> dit union savings income. Any change in the law at this point, which would give special treatment to the credit unions, could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that his remarks on Report Stage of the Finance Bill on 8 March last have been regarded by the credit unions as grossly insulting, particularly his suggestion that their proposals were an open invitation to people to put their money in savings which will not come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, and his remark that we would be inviting tax evasion if we adopted the credit union proposal, which was in effect the proposal of the chairman of the working group, and that the Deputies in this House who are supporting the credit unions' proposals are hypocrites who are advocating what they know to be a system of tax evasion for the purposes of vote catching in their constituencies? In the light of that, will the Minister now do the decent thing, apologise to the Irish League of Credit Unions and agree to meet it at the earliest possible date?</P>

A feature not unique to Ireland &ndash; it is the same throughout Europe &ndash; is that people do not like to pay income tax.

That being the case, and again noting how resolute the Minister is in his refusals, has the meeting which the Irish League of Credit Unions had with the Taoiseach any status? Is there anything to be explored as long as the current Minister is Minister for Finance?

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the increase in inflation of 4.3% in the 12 months to February 2000 is a mat ter for concern; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously, the recent increase in the rate of inflation reflects a number of factors, which include the fall in the value of the euro; the increase in crude oil prices, which have added more than 1% to inflation; the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco, which was introduced for health reasons and which has added about 0.75% to inflation; and domestic demand pressures.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, changes in the value of the exchange rate and movements in international oil prices are outside our control. It is expected that inflation will peak in the near future and begin to fall in the second half of the year. The Government's main concern is to ensure that this once-off increase in inflation will not lead to unsustainable wage developments which could damage our economic prospects. Adherence to the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is essential in this context.</P>
      <P>Enhancing competition is also important in keeping inflation low. Greater competition has put downward pressure on prices in certain sectors. The fall in telecommunications costs is one example. The Government is continuing to pursue these market-based reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulties low paid workers have in accepting that a 5.5% annual wage increase is sufficient compensation for an inflation rate of almost 4.5%? He did very little in his budget to take low paid workers out of the tax net and the increase of 5.5% will be fully subject to 22% tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy read a recent statistical commentary which showed the rate of tax and social insurance contributions paid by those earning £10,000 and upwards is much lower than that paid in our neighbouring country, the United Kingdom. The Deputy will also be aware that in the period preceding partnership in 1987, we continually awarded ourselves high nominal wage increases, which followed high inflation and led to higher tax increases. That led to a circle of high unemployment and put our public finances in a critical position. Since 1987, we have adopted the other approach of awarding ourselves low nominal wage increases, combined with tax reductions. Everybody's standard of living has increased dramatically, particularly between 1994 and 1999. Everybody's standard of living will increase further over the lifetime of the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with the terms of the pay increases and the tax reductions. That is the reason the trade union movement voted so overwhelmingly for the recent PPF agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his casual and nonchalant attitude to the highest inflation rates in the European Union is undermining the partnership agreement which he lauds? Does he realise that a more rigorous attitude to the dangers of inflation would help combat industrial relations problems, which we know from the situation on the streets of Dublin today is getting out of hand? We know that what is coming down the pipeline is set to undermine the new PPF at a very early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that most economic commentators and analysts agree with my supposition regarding inflation. The main determinants of inflation have been exchange rate led. The increased cost of oil has also led to increased inflation. At least half the inflation figure relates to those two areas and to the tobacco increases I announced in the December budget. The other factors are attributable locally. However, most analysts agree with me and it is proved by any analysis of the figures.</P>
      <P>I reject any assertions that the Minister for Finance or the Government could do anything which would have any dampening effect on the level of inflation. Taking a reasonable view of what will happen over the next year, particularly in regard to the oil market, we expect inflation to peak a little higher and then return to better and lower levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear the Government has influence over inflation &ndash; almost 1% of the 4.3% increase was due to decisions announced by the Minister on budget day. Does the Minister agree that the price of an ordinary three bedroom semi-detached house has doubled since the Government came into office? Does he not realise the pressure that is exerting on the wage front for young couples, particularly young public servants? Will he do anything about that? Or will he say, as he just has, that the Government has no influence over these matters and will continue to stand idly by, as a Fianna Fáil Government did on another famous occasion?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent statement by an economist at the ESRI expressing concern regarding the economic outlook; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in its most recent assessment of the economic outlook, forecast continued strong economic growth. For this year, growth in GNP of almost 6% is forecast. For next year, growth in GNP of almost 5% is expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to below 4.5% by 2001. These projections are broadly in line with my Department's assessment, which I presented to the Dáil on budget day last December.</P>
      <P>I agree with the ESRI that the competitiveness of the economy is a key concern. Maintaining competitive wage levels was a key objective of the recently agreed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF. I am pleased the ESRI's assessment is that &ldquo;these wage increases are reasonable and within the range the economy can afford&rdquo;. It is crucial for the economy that the terms of this new agreement are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI suggests that the commitments to cutting taxes and increasing expenditure outlined in the PPF could endanger our medium term economic prospects. It is the view of the Government that not only are tax cuts an essential part of the agreement, but they are also necessary to support increases in the supply of labour. The commitments in this programme are predicated on the Government continuing to run significant <Col N="334" /> budget surpluses. Last year we recorded the largest surplus in the history of the State. The Government intends to continue with its prudent policies while addressing the many problems we face.</P>
    <P>The ESRI also highlights pressures in the housing market. Increasing the supply of housing remains the Government's main policy response to the sharp increase in prices. Last year, almost 50,000 houses were built, compared to 21,000 in 1993, an increase of more than 100% over the period. The Government is continuing with a range of initiatives to further increase the supply of housing. Success in this area is already being reflected in moderating house price growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister give any credence to the comments of an economist at the ESRI that there should be a tightening approach to budgetary policy rather than the inflationary approach that has been pursued in recent budgets? Does the Minister take seriously what the economist said or is he totally discarding it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Economists make suggestions and advisers give advice all the time, and Governments take some of them and reject others. For a number of years that particular economist and others have recommended to successive Governments that tax relief on mortgage interest should be abolished. No Government, however, has ever abided by that advice. Other economists have recommended to me that we should not be increasing current and public expenditure, and I have not taken that advice either. The public capital programme is one way of trying to create a better infrastructure which allows economic growth to continue and will moderate any price inflation. Therefore, I do not accept the suggestion that tax cuts are inflationary. The combination of tax cuts and moderate wage increases has been a recipe for a large part of our economic success. I take into account some things the ESRI says, in that it is important to maintain competitiveness. The way we have approached this in recent years is the balanced and correct way of doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the HICP, inflation in the euro zone in February was 2%, whereas it was 4.6% in Ireland.

Will he consider taking steps to cool down the economy?</P>

      <P>I would like people to be quite clear on what some economists are talking about. As the Deputy knows, I do not subscribe to the economic textbook view of inflation as it applies in Ireland. I am on the record as having said so <Col N="335" /> for many years when I was in Opposition and I have been proven correct about it. If one accepted that one could tackle inflation by doing something in the fiscal area, one would be talking about taking not hundreds of millions of pounds out of the economy but billions if it were to have any effect, which would be very small. The only way of doing that would be to impose higher taxes rather than reducing them, or to cut current expenditure by billions of pounds. Is anyone in this House advocating that we should do that? First, it would not be politically possible and, second, it would be economically daft because it does not work like that in a small open economy such as Ireland's. That has been proven in recent years. People looking at the economy from outside should not apply textbook economic theories as they apply to larger closed economies because it has not worked like that here.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to a similar question on 23 February last, it has long been my desire that dormant funds should be transferred from financial institutions to the care of the State in order that they may be used for the common good. A similar approach was also recommended by the recent Committee of Public Accounts DIRT inquiry. To this end, I have circulated proposals to my colleagues in Government setting out my proposals in this area. As soon as the Government makes a decision on the matter, I will be making an appropriate announcement.</P>
      <P>Subject to Government approval, my Department will be consulting representatives of the financial services, including the Central Bank, with a view to bringing forward definitive proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the extent and value of dormant accounts, no overall information is available as to how many dormant accounts there are or how much is in them. Obviously, the answer would depend on how one defined the term &ldquo;dormant account&rdquo;. However, my Department, in consultation with the financial institutions, carried out a preliminary survey in the mid-1990s which indicated that there was £15 million in accounts which had been dormant in banks, building societies and the Post Office Savings Bank for 20 years or more. This did not include the value of any dor<Col N="336" /> mant insurance policy proceeds. No further estimates as to the value of dormant accounts have been made since then.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at this stage to outline the details of my proposals but, as I said in the House on 23 February, I have advocated a procedure whereby all financial institutions would be required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the lawful owners of such accounts are identified in the first instance and the funds returned to their control. The procedure I envisage would also ensure that at all stages persons entitled to dormant accounts would have the right to have the funds returned to them.</P>

      <P>Now that the Deputy mentions it, I note that there is an amount of confusion on today's Question Paper. Question No. 6 refers to &ldquo;the extent and value of doormat accounts&rdquo;. The confusion is not just around here. I presume it means dormant accounts.</P>

      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts made suggestions about this matter. Over the past 18 months to two years, however, I have initiated procedures in my Department to progress legislation in this regard. This was done both on my own initiative and following the cajoling of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe who takes a particular interest in this matter. Much of the work, therefore, has already been advanced. When we get these legal difficulties out of the way we will be able to circulate the Bill for formal observations. It should not take much longer then to bring the Bill before the House. I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to introduce a Bill on dormant accounts this year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister forming a view as to what constitutes a dormant account? He mentioned the sum of £15 million which had been in dormant accounts for over 20 years, but I recollect that an account that had been dormant for five years was similarly classified. Would the Minister be inclined to take the period of 20 years rather than five years as constituting a dormant account? I would regard five years as being much too short.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister keep in mind my concern that there should be a statutory obligation of notification of owners of accounts &ndash; it is obviously not being done on a non-statutory basis &ndash; so that we can minimise as far as possible the number of dormant accounts and make sure their owners can claim them?</P>

      <P>The figure I referred to in my reply is from a survey that was carried out by my Department in the mid-1990s. The estimated time for dormant accounts was 20 years. As regards the figure of £15 million, the estimate was that £7 million was in the banks, £1 million in the building societies and £7 million in post office savings accounts. That was a rough survey as far as I am aware.</P>

      <P>I concur with the Deputy. I have not put final proposals to Government but the appropriate timeframe might be between five years and 20 years. I would be inclined to favour the lower end of the market and I will explain why. The intended procedure, as I have outlined, given a certain number of years as constituting a dormant account, is that the bank or financial institution will be required to find out whether it is a dormant account and write to the customer. It would probably take three or six months for that procedure to be completed. After that, it would be a matter for the State. In any event, if a person turns up in one, two or 20 years and claimed an account, the legislation will provide that that person must get his or her money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been the policy of the EU Commission to extend the use of qualified majority voting to areas where this procedure does not apply. Suggestions to extend the use of this procedure to the taxation area were raised at previous intergovernmental conferences by the Commission and the proposal has been returned to on this occasion. I refer the Deputy to my earlier answer of 26 January 2000 to a similar question where I indicated that unanimity should be retained for all taxation decisions in the European Union. Ireland does not, therefore, support qualified majority voting in this area.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that the Irish position is tenable and is it supported at this stage by other member states?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission, for example, wants to introduce qualified majority voting &ndash; there is qualified majority voting in most areas except for sensitive areas such as taxation. The Government position is as I outlined, I am opposed and will continue to be opposed to it. Other mechanisms are being put forward which, if the Government went along with them, would eventually lead to qualified majority voting in taxation by the back door and I am not prepared to go along with that either. A sovereign Government should retain the rights over the taxation of its citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the view &ndash; the Minister will probably agree with me &ndash; that relating to competition policy, for example, it is suggested that Ireland is in breach of competition rules by virtue of our corporate taxation regime. We got clearance from the Commission in the relatively recent past on that, but the fact that the suggestion is made implies that our so-called veto is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Deputy in that I guess there will be further attempts by the Commission in a wide variety of areas to, what I loosely term, circumvent the question of having unanimity in taxation matters. It has long been the view of the Commission that there should be qualified majority voting in all areas and some of the major states would prefer that for obvious <Col N="339" /> and good reasons. It would be very detrimental to small countries such as Ireland. Events of the past ten years in Europe, including Ireland, should encourage Irish policy makers that had there been qualified majority voting in many areas, including taxation, we would not have the economic success we are experiencing. Deputy McDowell and I might disagree on that, but I am certain that would not be the case because a far different regime would be imposed if we had qualified majority voting. Not alone for this Administration but for future Administrations, it is a tenet that should not be very easily given up and I do not foresee a position where an Irish Government would easily forgo it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is of a similar opinion, it is a non-negotiable principle as far as we are concerned. Has the issue of non-majority voting held up finalisation of green or environmental taxes? Will the Minister give us a short summary of where that issue stands because the clock is ticking on it? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a separate question later about environmental taxation, but that also requires unanimity. I have, as I said previously, always adopted a reasonable position in terms of environmental taxation measures enunciated by the Commission, but Spain and Ireland are holding out against some of the proposals. If we were not in politically correct times, I would use a phrase that is used in County Kildare about certain matters, but I will not do so here. Any breach of allowing the principle to be broken would be very detrimental. I understand the Deputy's view and there may be occasions where in some areas we could go along with that, but any breach of unanimity would be detrimental.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 50 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Since announcing the Government's intention to proceed with a new decentralisation programme in my Budget Statement, I have more recently initiated a consultative process with my Government colleagues with a view to taking decisions on a significant programme of decentralisation by the summer. This process will involve the identification of suitable parts of Departments and Government offices and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies for decentralisation and the selection of those centres to which they will be relocated.</P>
      <P>The selection of suitable centres to which Government offices will be relocated will depend on a number of criteria. It is not possible at this stage to provide an exhaustive and definitive list of such criteria other than to say that it will be influenced by the Government's desire to promote regional development and economic growth and to create a more even spread of public service jobs around the country. The Government will also be conscious of other issues which are likely to impact on the success of the programme. These could include issues such as proximity to third level institutions, convenient access to Dublin, the scale of particular offices being decentralised, availability of services, etc.</P>
      <P>I am conscious also of the calls on me and other members of the Government to use the vehicle of decentralisation to address job losses in particular areas of the country and in that regard I note the point made about those towns which have failed to attract industry. In view of the process which is under way I would consider it unhelpful if I were to comment on the likelihood or otherwise of any particular location being included in the forthcoming programme, though I assure Deputies that all the proposals made for inclusion will be fully considered by the Government as part of this consultative process. Arising from the process on which the Government has now embarked we will, after the Government has taken the appropriate decisions, have a coherent approach which will allow us to progress expeditiously the most ambitious programme of decentralisation in the history of the State. Any decision relating to the decentralisation of part of any Department or office will be taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very welcome. It does not have to be the county town for example. Returning to the point I made about the IDA, in the case of those towns where the IDA is finding it almost impossible to attract industry, surely those towns, if they have all the services necessary, should receive preferential treatment, especially where job losses have been experienced in recent times. If the IDA gives a firm declaration that it has been striving to attract industries to these towns and cannot do so, surely the only way to proceed is by way of decentralisation, the only instrument available to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that certain areas in the country have attracted very few, if any, jobs will be one of the criteria taken into account. The loss of jobs in certain areas will also be a consideration. As I said in reply to the earlier priority question, this is particularly ambitious. We have not attempted decentralisation on this scale before, but the success of decentralisation in the past &ndash; not just for the towns concerned but for the Departments involved &ndash; has done everyone some good. Those working in the public service in Dublin see the attractions in going to other parts of Ireland in a way they would not have considered 15 years ago. I will bear the Deputy's advice in mind when towns are selected and it will be one of the criteria the Government will use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government decision to implement a further decentralisation programme. It has been part of Fianna Fáil policy for many years. Does the Minister agree that Border areas like Cavan have suffered immensely for 30 years, that there has been very little economic activity and that inward investment has been very limited? The decentralisation of public sector jobs would be a key catalyst in generating economic activity in an area that has suffered so much. Will the Minister assure me that Cavan will be given particularly favourable consideration when decentralisation decisions are made by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the Border counties suffered more in the past 30 years than any other part of the country, primarily due to the problems in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, their peripheral status meant they would not attract the same level of industry as other parts of the country. Those factors led to a poor economic situation there and I assure the Deputy those matters will be borne in mind when <Col N="342" /> the Government makes decisions about decentralisation. No area has been ruled in and no area has been ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is what the Minister says true? It is worth pointing out that virtually all Civil Service offices are in Dublin 2 and 4. Nobody seems to have given consideration to locating offices in the northern part of Dublin city. When considering decentralisation, relocation or location within the city should not be excluded.</P>
      <P>The programme of decentralisation is being derailed or is at risk of having its reputation seriously tarnished before it gets going by virtue of decisions announced by individual Ministers to relocate sections of their Departments in their constituencies. The Minister is not immune from this, having moved the State Laboratory in Celbridge, County Kildare, from Abbotstown. We are bringing the system into disrepute before it gets up and running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the people involved do not regard moving from Abbotstown across Backweston as preferential treatment from the Minister for Finance. Funnily enough, before the decision was made I received letters from some of the staff in the State Laboratory suggesting that if the sports campus was to be built in Abbotstown, the most suitable area for location was Grange or Backweston, as the latter was only a few miles away and is owned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the other issues raised by the Deputy in a reply to an earlier question from Deputy Noonan. The decisions of the past two and a half years were made in the context of specific Government tasks, such as the White Paper on Defence and the building of Stadium Ireland. The procedure we are going to embark upon is a total programme of decentralisation and, when it is over, the majority of public servants will be outside the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>Regarding areas in north Dublin, the Deputy may have seen a report in today's newspaper referring to a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party at which his colleagues in north Dublin, Deputies Noel Ahern and Pat Carey, were particularly anxious to state that north Dublin should not be excluded from any relocation of Government offices from Dublin 2 and 4.</P>

      <P>That it is proposed to relocate 50,000 public servants has whetted the appetite of every small town in the country and we want to see fair play and even-handedness. That is all we ask. We do not want the Minister for Foreign Affairs to decentralise another Department to Tullamore. We do not want the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to decentralise sections of his Department to Galway or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to decentralise more sections to Cahirciveen. Can we not have fair play? Can we have a commission to examine the merits of every city?</P>
      <P>We in Waterford are willing to take the rough with the smooth. We are being named as the town to take the first refugee flotel and we are willing to take the rough with the smooth, but we want a little recognition. If we give a little, we want to take a little also. The Minister is fair and can understand my point. We have the highest unemployment rate in Ireland; that has been authenticated by the Central Statistics Office. Will the Minister consider that and bring it into play? Why can we not have a commission instead of political cronyism? That is what the public detests. We want everyone to get their fair dues.</P>

The Minister will be aware that the western region has suffered enormously from depopulation and this is an opportunity to remedy this. An excellent case has been made by various local organisations and the Kilrush Urban District Council and was presented to the Minister. It is an unanswerable case for decentralisation and would have major impact on the economic development of the west Clare area. Will he give that case special consideration?</P>

      <P>In all of the initiatives I have taken while in Government, I never received anything approaching the level of representations I received in regard to decentralisation over the past two and a half years. I will certainly bear deprived parts of the country in mind, areas which have not benefited from industry or which have been depopulated as a result of emigration, when making a decision. Some people complain about extra houses being built in their areas when some parts of the country are crying out for development and would be extremely grateful to see even a small number of public service employees being relocated there.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to similar questions tabled by Deputies Owen and Currie on 16 February 2000. As I stated in my reply, the Government has decided that the laboratories and other facilities currently occupying the Abbotstown site should be relocated elsewhere. The State Laboratory and the other laboratories under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will be relocated to Backweston Farm which is located between Lucan and Celbridge. The Marine Institute is being relocated to Galway. The cost of relocating these facilities is estimated to be of the order of £90 million. The estimated cost is additional to the estimated cost of the proposed campus and Stadium Ireland. This estimate does not include the cost of relocating the farm at Abbotstown. This matter is being examined by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the development of the facilities on the new sites will necessarily involve upgrading to bring them into line with best modern practice. Deputies will appreciate that high technology facilities of this kind are expensive and that, in the circumstances, the cost is unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has a justifiable reputation for being a careful public spending watchdog. Perhaps the Minister will tease out this issue with me. The stated cost of the stadium is £280 million at this stage, together with a further £20 million, give or take, for the provision of a swimming pool. The Minister outlined a further £90 million in regard to relocation costs. I am sure the Minister is aware of the observation made in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that these costs tend to be understated and that, typically, the costs for the stadia which it studied tended to typically overrun by up to 70%. Would the Minister agree that an end figure in the region of £500 million would not be unreasonable and would he consider that to represent good value for money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to record my total support for the concept of a national stadium. I am aware this matter has been dealt with primarily by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation but I have long held the view that Ireland needs and deserves a national stadium. I am sure Deputy Wall would concur with the value of good sporting facilities as he is very <Col N="347" /> involved with the GAA. The time is right for Ireland to have a national stadium and the foresight of this Government will be remembered long after we have all left this House.</P>
      <P>The costs which have been outlined are the current estimates and, as shown by the study to which the Deputy referred, it is often possible that these costs can be understated. A decision was made to build an 80,000 seat national stadium which I believe the Ireland of the 21st century needs and deserves.</P>

      <P>That is like asking me the cost of the road from Dublin to Mullingar. I can only outline the estimates which have been provided to me in regard to the costs. The estimated cost of the new stadium is of the order of £281 million. The relocation of the facilities currently located at Abbotstown is estimated to cost in the region of £90 million. We intend that those facilities, when relocated, will be as up-to-date as possible; there is no point in doing a patchwork job. At this point all of the estimates are preliminary. My colleague, Deputy Cullen, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, will progress these matters. Ireland deserves a national stadium and I support its provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In last year's Finance Act, I introduced significant changes to the pension arrangements for the self-employed and proprietary directors. First, the new arrangements increased significantly the tax deductible amounts which the self-employed can set aside each year to fund their retirement benefits. Depending on age and occupation, amounts of up to 30% can now be set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, these arrangements introduced a greater degree of personal choice and flexibility <Col N="348" /> in relation to the drawing down of benefits for the self-employed and proprietary directors. The old rule which forced pensioners to take out an annuity was abolished and, instead, the self-employed and proprietary directors now have the option of choosing between purchasing an annuity, receiving the balance of the fund in cash, which would be taxable apart from the lump sum, or investing in either an approved retirement fund, ARF, or an approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF. An ARF or AMRF allows the individual control over how the pension fund is invested during his or her retirement and also allows the individual to retain ownership of the fund and to pass on any balance remaining in the fund following his or her death.</P>
    <P>I believe that these arrangements, which I introduced last year, have proven to be very popular and have been widely welcomed by both beneficiaries and also by the pensions industry. However, during the course of the last year, I received a number of representations highlighting certain issues that arose following the introduction of these new pension arrangements and also requests for an extension of the new arrangements. Consequently, following full consideration of the issues raised, I made a number of additional changes to the pension rules this year in the Finance Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Most significantly, I have introduced gross roll up for ARFs and AMRFs. This means that from 6 April next, tax will only be paid when the money leaves the fund, rather than the present system of taxation of the investment proceeds while the money is in the fund, with further tax being levied, in certain circumstances, when the money is taken out of the fund. In addition, I made a number of other changes, which are as follows. Proprietary directors who control more than 5% of the shares in their company can now avail of the new arrangements; previously the ownership requirement was 20%. Individuals whose pension date has passed but who have not yet invested in an annuity can now avail of the new pension options instead. The new pension choices have been extended to those using AVCs, that is, additional voluntary contributions, to build up their pension rights. I removed certain anomalies in the tax treatment of children who inherit moneys in an ARF or AMRF and, lastly all qualifying pension fund managers will now be subject to regulation by an independent regulatory agency in the State or in another EU member state.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the pension arrangements that I brought in last year combined with the improvements which I recently introduced, will be of significant benefit to both the individual pension holders as well as to those operating in the pension industry. It is not yet possible to estimate the degree to which those retiring have availed of the option to take out an ARF. <Col N="349" /> However, given the degree of interest and welcome shown to the new arrangements, I am satisfied that they have had considerable impact to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question to find out the take-up. I accept that there may be some difficulty in assessing this. However, surely it is possible at this stage to estimate the number of people who have taken the opportunity to invest or set aside more than the previous maximum of 15% of their total salary, in order to avail of the tax-free allowance. That information should have been available from the end of January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the details but I am sure it is not available yet. The Revenue garnered this information from the returns of self-employed persons. The year 1999-2000 is the first year in which the new rules will apply. If I remember my tax law correctly, a return for the year 1999-2000 will not have to be filed until 31 January 2000. This is the first year of the scheme and I would say the take up will be small. It will be some time before we have the information requested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

The Revenue Commissioners produced a fine booklet on the details of this scheme although it is not their job to sell this concept. The financial institutions were not hesitant in trying to sell these new arrangements. Given the changes I have made, some of which were requested by the financial institutions to make the operation of the scheme easier, there will be a greater take-up this year. It will be some time before we know the numbers but I will give any information I have to the Deputy. I am sure the Revenue Commissioners or the industry will conduct a survey during the year.</P>

      <P>As a general rule, persons who are not registered for VAT cannot claim a credit <Col N="350" /> for the VAT paid on business inputs. As a group, unregistered farmers are compensated for the VAT paid by them on their farming inputs in accordance with a mechanism provided for in the EU Sixth VAT Directive. The scheme, which is essentially a simplification measure, provides for a set amount, known as the flat-rate refund or addition, which farmers add to their prices and retain when selling to VAT registered businesses, co-ops, meat factories etc. The VAT registered business, in turn, deducts the addition as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return.</P>
      <P>The amount of the flat-rate for any year is arrived at by calculating the VAT payable on agricultural inputs as a percentage of agricultural sales for the preceding three years. The flat-rate addition for 2000 is 4.2%. The cost to the Exchequer of the flat rate is as follows: 1997, £98 million; 1998, £93 million and 1999, £103 million. Unregistered farmers who bear VAT on the construction of farm buildings, land drainage or reclamation for farming may obtain a VAT refund under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order 1993. Unregistered farmers' VAT repayments were as follows: 1997, £33 million; 1998, £30 million and 1999, £21 million.</P>

      <P>To date, approximately 1,000 public buildings, including Government offices, Garda stations, schools, heritage buildings and military establishments, have been surveyed by the Office of Public Works to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. This early stage of the nationwide survey was concentrated in buildings where, from local staff information, asbestos was known or <Col N="351" /> suspected to exist. Asbestos material of one type or another and in varying quantities was identified in 315 of these buildings. Works necessary to deal with the problem are being carried out on a priority basis.

As many qualified experts as we can find have surveyed 1,000 buildings. From the information given to me by my officials, I am satisfied that where problems have been encountered, they have been dealt with quickly. In many cases, the problem was not as bad as anticipated. Schools are a priority. We have consulted local people and dealt with the schools which suspected there was a problem. I do not know which press reports the Deputy referred to but I am certain we are on top of this problem. It is difficult to estimate the overall cost; we have spent about £2 million to date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for taking this important matter. I appreciate the Minister's phone call today explaining the Department's position. In the Kildare offices of the Department there are approximately 500 to 560 people on the live register. This comprises a number of catchment areas such as Monasterevin, Rathangan, Suncroft and Kildare town. The biggest reason for the objection to the closure is the central position of the office in relation to the catchment areas. The loss of the office will be a major financial loss to the town of Kildare in that those in receipt of social welfare payments will, upon receipt of these payments, spend the money immediately on household goods such as food and so on in the area where the money is received. The closure of the Kildare office will mean a loss of revenue to the town to the magnitude of £300,000 per year. Kildare is a small town which can ill-afford such a loss to traders.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Councillor Jim Keane, placed a picket on the office as a result of the closure. He informed me that he has received the full support of almost everyone using the office and of passersby who believe the office should not be permitted to close. I understand an offer has been made to the Department for a take-over of the franchise and this should be fully investigated and granted. Kildare has probably the best motorways in the country, however there is a great lack of transport throughout the county. This will create major problems for people living in these catchment areas who must travel to areas where the payments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in receipt of social welfare payments visit the community welfare officer in relation to other matters. If the Kildare branch closes, these people will have to travel to Newbridge, Portarlington, Athy or wherever. This will place an extra cost burden on these people who must travel to Kildare town to visit the community welfare officer and will cause further <Col N="353" /> problems for people in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has come to the House and I ask him to consider seriously my points in relation to the loss of revenue to Kildare town and the problems which will be created for recipients of social welfare payments in terms of transport and visits to the community welfare officer. In many instances this is as important as the payments these people receive. I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the retention of the office in Kildare town, even in the short-term, to allow many of the problems to be teased out. I hope many of these people will obtain full-time employment in the near future. I ask that in the short-term the office be kept open in its present form to ensure that transport for these people will not cost any more than at present and that a structure is put in place where a community welfare officer can facilitate them in the town to which they travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for his remarks.</P>
      <P>The manager of my Department's branch office in Kildare is due to retire with effect from 6 April this year. She has been employed on a contract basis as branch manager since 1 August 1973.</P>
      <P>The current position is that 590 persons are registered as unemployed at the branch office. This includes 240 people who are within the six mile radius of the office and who sign on there once a month. The remaining 250 customers, who live more than six miles from the office, sign on at their nearest Garda station and are dealt with on a postal basis from the office. There are also a number of recipients of the farm assist scheme as well as systematic short-time workers registered at the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of disruption of payments to customers of the office on the retirement of the manager, since payments under the unemployment schemes are no longer made at branch offices but rather at local post offices. In the normal course, when a branch manager retires my Department examines the position with a view to establishing how best to provide a replacement service which will meet the needs of the people living in the area, taking account of the changing needs of customers and the changes in the way services will be delivered in future. Significant attention has been given in recent years to improving the level of customer service at my Department's offices through, for example, the provision of a modern and professional information service and a higher standard of accommodation at those offices. In addition, improvements have taken place in the processing of claims and in the level of ongoing contact and <Col N="354" /> assistance provided to the people who depend on our services. It is my intention to continue to build on these improvements.</P>
    <P>The question of how best to provide a modern service to the people of Kildare town and hinterland following the retirement of the branch manager is under consideration in my Department. A decision on the matter will be made in the coming weeks and I will notify the Deputy of the outcome. I assure the Deputy, however, that there will be no disruption of service in the meantime. The claimload will be managed by the Newbridge social welfare local office, which is the parent office of the Kildare branch office, pending a decision on the nature of the replacement of the service to be provided in Kildare.

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Woods, for attending to listen to my plea on behalf of the teachers, pupils and parents at Castlelyons national school, County Cork. The Minister, being relatively new to the Department, may not be fully aware of the history of the school and this problem. The school management board has been in contact with the Department on many occasions in recent years in relation to a number of serious infrastructural problems in the school which require a positive response from the Department. The first issue relates to toilet facilities within the school which are entirely insufficient for this day and age. It is not acceptable that boys and girls must cross the yard to their respective toilets, particularly during wet weather. This should not be the case in the era of the Celtic tiger. The toilet facilities in the school need urgent improvement. Representations have been made in the matter to the Minister's office on a number of occasions and I am hoping for a positive reply.</P>
      <P>One classroom within the school is in such poor condition that it needs complete renovation. There are problems with the floor, the walls and the windows. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Department on a number of occasions and there has been no response. This problem is worthy of attention.</P>
      <P>Remedial education in the school is proving difficult because of a lack of proper accommodation. The existing remedial room is much too small for the teacher and pupils who have to use it. In this day and age of remedial education it is important that proper facilities are available in all our schools. Unfortunately, at Castlelyons the remedial room is much too small and is also in need of refurbishment. Some of the school furniture which is in place since the school was built in 1967 is in a poor condition. It has served its time and purpose and is in need of replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> The official school office is not much bigger than a car trailer at 10 ft. by 6 ft. A school which has a teaching staff of six needs a somewhat larger office. This matter has been brought to the attention of the Department on numerous occasions and a response is awaited. That type of office accommodation is not acceptable today.</P>
    <P>A valid complaint has been made that the school is in need of a staff room. That is not an extraordinary request. Currently the six staff members spend their break time in one of the classrooms. That is far from the ideal and must be remedied at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The interior walls of the building are in need of painting. The school is also in need of floor covering and furniture. Collectively all the problems outlined paint a bleak picture of the school's infrastructure. From an academic point of view, the school is outstanding, has a good record and is respected within the community. What is lacking, however, is investment by the Department of Education and Science in the school's facilities.</P>
    <P>A detailed dossier was sent to the Minister's Department in early 1999. Since then there has been a degree of correspondence but it has been one-sided. The Department's response has been inadequate. I hope the Minister will take time to look at the file, note the serious problems that exist, accept there must be an immediate response from his Department and provide the funding to ensure teachers, pupils and the people of Castlelyons have the type of school they need and deserve in 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Minister for Education and Science </b>
    </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): I am glad the Deputy has given me an opportunity to outline to the House my Department's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Castlelyons national school. The school has a staffing level of principal, four assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The school's facilities consist of five classrooms and a general-purpose room.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> My Department received an application last year from the management authorities of the school seeking grant assistance towards additional facilities and major refurbishment works. My Department's planning and building unit is currently assessing the long-term enrolment situation at the school. This process is expected to be completed shortly and further consideration will then be given to the future accommodation needs of the school. I note what the Deputy said about the need for urgent refurbishment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a large number of schools building projects on hand within my Department. Because of the priority which the Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by the management authorities of Castlelyons national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible. I have noted the points made concerning the toilets, classroom, remedial room, office inadequacy, the lack of a staff room and the problems with the interior and will follow them up.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the comments I made in the interview he refers to were in the context of my proposals to the horseracing industry that I would be prepared to examine the existing financial provisions to support racing in the event of the industry agreeing to establish a new governing structure that would achieve desirable rationalisation, efficiencies and other potential improvements in the overall operation of Irish racing as a whole. My comments related to the possibility of revenue raised from the racing industry being ringfenced for use for funding of that industry. Therefore such funding would be sourced directly from the industry itself and would no longer be an issue when future decisions were being made in relation to prioritising public spending. Government policy in regard to the prioritising of areas for public spending will continue to be decided by the Government of the day in line with the requirements of the economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 23 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the State Property Act, 1954, deals with gifts of property being made to the State, the nation or the people. Where such a gift of property is made the decision to accept or refuse the gift is one for the Government. If such a gift is accepted it is a matter for the Government to determine the State authority in whom the gift should vest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the offer of a contribution of £50 million towards the financing and development of Campus and Stadium Ireland, the Government decided, pursuant to the State Property Act, 1954, <Col N="359" /> to accept the offer as a gift to the State and, as required by section 19(3) of the Act, determined that the gift should be vested in An Taoiseach, as the appropriate State authority. I should make it clear, therefore, that the funds have not been placed at the disposal of my Department.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the drawdown of the funds by the Department of the Taoiseach are set out in the letter of assignation between a bank and the Department, a copy of which has been laid before the Dáil. Deputies will note that the letter of assignation is very specific that the money offered is to be used solely in or towards financing and developing the stadium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 27 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste met with the Irish League of Credit Unions on 24 February to discuss the league's proposals on the taxation of credit unions. The EU aspect, which affects any taxation proposals, was also discussed at this meeting. Deputies will be aware that there are ongoing complaints with the EU Commission. The Irish Mortgage and Savings Association has made a complaint in relation to the current tax treatment of credit unions. This complaint alleges that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of their exemption from corporation tax and from DIRT. The Irish Banker's Federation has also made a complaint which I understand relates to the position of credit unions in respect of consumer credit legislation.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the Irish League of Credit Unions accepted the Government's position that complaints about taxation made to the EU Commission must be resolved before any further moves are made regarding the taxation of credit union savings income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Mr Pat Cox MEP received a letter from Commissioner Monti advising him that the commission is currently examining the situation from the point of view of the State aid rules of the treaty. The commissioner stated that the examination does not in principle preclude the Minister for Finance from reforming <Col N="360" /> the credit union tax position. However, the commissioner noted that any change made to the tax position may lead to different conclusions being arrived at. Consequently, any change in the law, at this point, which would give special treatment to the credit unions, could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The legal advice available to me is that there is no certainty that the decision on the most recent complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association will be the same as that given on the 1998 complaint which specifically related to the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by the Taoiseach in his statement following the meeting with the Irish League of Credit Unions, there are also general equity aspects which must be considered in relation to all financial institutions as well as ensuring the integrity of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the chairman of the Working Group on the Taxation of the Returns of Credit Union Savings will be further examined in the light of whatever decision the EU Commission takes in relation to the complaints about existing tax law. I am advised that it is both rational and logical to take the view that if credit union interest and dividends are not taxed either in the hands of the credit union, as is currently the case, nor in the hands of credit union members as is proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the same conclusion reached in 1998 by the commission can no longer be reached.</P>

    <P>The difference between the number of cards in issue and the number of taxable cards arises because stamp duty is not payable in respect of: ATM cards not used during the accounting period; ATM cards relating to deposit accounts with an average daily balance not exceeding £10 during the accounting period; ATM cards issued to <Col N="361" /> replace lost or stolen cards during the accounting period.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty yield from ATM cards for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 is £7.4 million, £7.9 million and £8.8 million respectively.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the above figures are not based on calendar year receipts-returns but on the accounting periods of the financial institutions concerned &ndash; as per the legislation.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty rate per ATM card is currently £5 per card. This charge to stamp duty is levied on financial institutions which offer these cash card accounts. However, section 203(8) of the 1992 Finance Act entitles the promoters of these cash cards to charge the account holders the amount of stamp duty and the financial institutions usually do pass on this stamp duty charge to their customers.</P>
    <P>The revenue from this source revenue permits the easement of taxes in other areas most notably income tax. I have no plans to introduce any exemptions in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>Draft legislation providing for the establishment, financing and management of a national pensions fund is being prepared by my Department. It is envisaged that the fund will help finance the Exchequer cost of the broad range of social welfare and public service pensions over the long-term. While there are a number of important policy issues to be considered in preparing the draft legislation, I hope to be in a position to bring pro<Col N="362" /> posals to the Government shortly and to introduce a Bill in the House before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that a sum of approximately £3 billion was paid into a temporary holding fund following the passing of interim legislation last December. This was the Exchequer allocation for pension funding in 1999 with £2.4 billion obtained from the Telecom Éireann flotation and nearly £600 million representing the 1% of GNP contribution for 1999. A provision in this year's Finance Act will enable a further sum of up to £1.85 billion to be paid into the temporary fund in the current year, of which nearly £1.2 billion is from the Telecom sale and about £650 million is an estimate of the 1% of GNP contribution for the year 2000. Moneys in the temporary fund are being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency in short-term deposits and financial instruments. These monies will be transferred to the national pensions fund once this is established under legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 37, 92, 94 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> The most recently published figures for February 2000 show a year-on-year increase on inflation in Ireland of 4.3% as measured by the Consumer Price Index and 4.6% as measured by the EU-Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. EU inflation for the same period, as measured by the European Union Index of Consumer Prices, was 1.9%.</P>
    <P>The latest data for each member state of the European Union are set out in the following table. Ireland's relatively high inflation rate is primarily due to: the increase in tobacco duties introduced in the budget for health reasons; the increase in crude oil prices combined with Ireland's relatively greater dependence on oil; relatively stronger imported inflation associated with the fall in the euro because Ireland has stronger trade links with countries outside the euro-area than other members of the EU.</P>
    <P>Assuming that there is no further increase in oil prices and that the euro remains at current levels, I expect inflation to peak in the near future before declining in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the large part of the inflation differential is expected to be temporary and has no significant implications for economic policy at this stage. However, services inflation is also higher in Ireland than elsewhere due to the strength of domestic demand. The Government is not complacent about these developments and is monitoring the situation closely. The Government's main concern is that the once-off increase in prices should not lead to wage developments that could damage our economic prospects. In this context adherence to the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is essential.</P>
    <P>Inflation in Europe is regularly discussed by European Union Finance Ministers as part of routine reviews of economic developments. These reviews include the examination of stability programmes and the annual broad economic policy guidelines process and in this context the inflation performance of individual countries is assessed using the HICP methodology.</P>

      <P>I have received correspondence from the Financial Services Industry Association regarding the look-back DIRT audit currently being undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to all financial institutions in the State. Such an audit was recommended by the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the operation of DIRT.</P>
      <P>I am advised that representatives of the Financial Services Industry Association met with revenue on 25 February last to discuss the concerns of IFSC institutions. There has also been an exchange of correspondence confirming the continuation of certain procedures regarding documentation which were agreed with my Department and Revenue some years ago and which were referred to by the comptroller and auditor general in his report. These have particular relevance for IFSC institutions.</P>
      <P>I am assured by revenue that deposit-taking institutions in the IFSC will be subject to audit in the same manner as other institutions. A common-sense approach will be adopted in relation to latitude in the area of documentary deficiencies. For example, it has been suggested that an otherwise properly completed non-resident declaration would be unacceptable if a London address did not also have &ldquo;England&rdquo; on the form. This is certainly not the case. Revenue will not be unreasonable on the question of tolerances.</P>
      <P>Revenue have confirmed that each institution will have an opportunity to discuss the findings of the audit in its case, including the implications of all documentary deficiencies, before any conclusions are reached. This is a reasonable approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, nor a member of the G8. It is, therefore, as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to seek to contribute to easing the debt burden of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need <Col N="366" /> for debt relief, particularly at the multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete relief, in respect of official bilateral debt. The initiative is clearly at a crucial stage in its development both in relation to its general implementation and its financing.</P>
    <P>As originally conceived, the initiative aimed at both freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt, and offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
    <P>Following the recent review of the initiative, it has been substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled, a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular via the submissions made by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the review of HIPC which led to the improvements.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the enhanced HIPC framework is estimated at $27.4 billion in 1998 NPV terms, $50 billion in nominal terms, for 33 HIPCs expected to qualify, excluding Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan, or more than double the total cost of $12.5 billion estimated for the previous framework. Given the magnitudes involved, decisions on the enhancements to the initiative have proceeded in parallel with agreement on additional financing for the IMF's contribution to the HIPC initiative, as well as that of other multilateral creditors, and the World Bank in particular. Under the enhanced framework, the shares of HIPC Initiative costs for bilateral and multilateral creditors are estimated to remain roughly equal. Overall costs to multilateral creditors are projected to rise to $13.3 billion under the enhanced framework, excluding Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan, from $6.2 billion under the original framework.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes moves by the international donor community to address the external debt burden of the world's most heavily indebted poor countries and also the consequent effects of this burden on growth, development and poverty reduction in these countries. As a strong supporter of the HIPC initiative, Ireland contributed £12.1 million in 1999 to the debt relief package and is committed to payment of a further £2.9 million by 2008.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the enhanced HIPC initiative is the only realistic mechanism through which multilateral debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries can be achieved. Successful and timely implementation of the enhanced framework would create an opportunity for further enhancement, which I would fully support and consider vital for future growth and development in HIPC countries. In this regard, I am particularly concerned that the number of countries processed to date falls short of projections under the enhanced <Col N="367" /> HIPC framework and I am also somewhat disappointed at the amount of pledges to the HIPC trust fund that have been converted to paid-in contributions. Given these concerns, the Deputy can be assured that I will use my best endeavours to press for the full and speedy implementation of the HIPC Initiative, both in terms of the number of countries processed and also its financing.</P>
    <P>Although I have concerns regarding the progress of the HIPC initiative, I see it as a suitable framework through which viable economic and social reform programmes, including debt relief measures, can best be achieved. In this regard the Deputy should be aware that Ireland is also pressing the multilateral institutions to ensure that programmes drawn up by HIPC countries take adequate account of the social needs of these countries. We are also supporting increased co-ordination both between the various institutions involved and with a wider spectrum of society in the countries concerned to ensure that aid, including debt relief, is used in the most efficient way to promote development and protect the social sector. These efforts are bearing fruit with the recent commitment of the multilateral institutions to target their activities in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way on poverty reduction, e.g. through the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, which will form the bedrock of the bank and the fund's assistance to IDA countries, and which will also inform the partnership between these institutions and the countries concerned. They will also be a key element in strengthening the link between debt relief and poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>The HIPC initiative goes a long way towards tackling the issue of multilateral debt and poverty reduction. While it also envisages substantial reductions in bilateral debt, there is clearly scope for individual countries to go further on this and I am heartened by the indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to do so. We have been advocating and supporting this development in our international dealings.</P>

      <P>The Roundfort and Bushfield areas are situated in-adjacent to the Hollymount area of County Mayo. The area in question was excluded at design stage from the Corrib-Mask-<Col N="368" /> Robe catchment drainage scheme carried out by the Office of Public Works between 1979 and 1987.

      <P>Since the beginning of the year the euro has fallen by almost 6% against the US dollar. Given our trade links with the US, this would be expected to have an impact on the Irish economy. On the positive side, the competitiveness of Irish companies exporting to the US should improve, leading to higher exports and employment. On the negative side, these trends should push up the price of goods imported from the United States. This increase in import prices would in turn be expected to put upward pressure on inflation and, ultimately, offset any potential competitiveness gains accruing to exporters. Given that oil is priced in dollar terms a fall in the euro-dollar exchange rate tends to push up energy prices.</P>
      <P>As regards future exchange rate developments, as Minister for Finance I have not commented in the past on either the Irish pound exchange rate or the euro exchange rate and I do not intend to do so now.</P>

      <P>On 18 January last, I reluctantly accepted the joint <Col N="370" /> recommendation of the boards of ACC Bank, TSB Bank and the non-statutory board set up to oversee the merger and flotation that the process should not proceed. I reiterated my view to the board of ACC Bank and the trustees of TSB Bank that the <i>status quo</i> of both organisations could not continue and I asked each bank to urgently review its position with a view to bringing forward proposals for the future that address the need for change in order to face the increasing competitive marketplace. I also told them that that a change in the ownership structure is vitally important to secure the long-term interests of each bank.</P>
      <P>In the case of ACC Bank, the proposals of the board are awaited.</P>
      <P>The trustees of TSB Bank announced last Tuesday, 28 March that they were inviting proposals in relation to the future of the bank. When this process is completed, I would expect to receive a formal request from the trustees to approve new arrangements. An order under section 57 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, which would have to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas, would be required to authorise any re-organisation of the TSB.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in implementing the PPP process since the announcement of pilot projects on 1 June last year.</P>
      <P>An ambitious programme has been set for the delivery of the pilot PPP roads projects. The National Roads Authority is aiming to seek tenders for the Waterford scheme in late 2000 and the Limerick scheme in mid 2001. In the case of the M50-west link second bridge scheme, I am informed that negotiations between National Toll Roads, NTR, and the National Roads Authority on a design, build, finance and operate scheme have concluded, with construction to commence in 2001. The NRA is also investigating the feasibility of a PPP approach to the provision of the Kilcock-Kinnegad project. I understand that the route selection is under way and the NRA aims to be in a position to seek tenders in late 2000. The NRA is in the process of engaging both legal and also financial and technical consultants to assist in the procurement of the pilot projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has made significant progress in relation to its pilot projects. A third level project, the redevelopment of the Cork School of Music, was announced by the Minister for Education and Science on 18 October 1999 and a package of pilot second level schools has also been selected. The Department of Education and Science are engaging advisors <Col N="371" /> to assist in the delivery of these projects; the projects are expected to go to tender in mid 2000.</P>
    <P>I understand that, following consultations with interested parties, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has recently approved a pilot water supply project for Ballymore Eustace on a design, build, operate and finance basis. A further project has been approved for Clareville in Limerick on the same basis. Also, work is continuing on PPP projects in the water supply area which do not involve private finance such as wastewater treatment facilities in Dublin and Cork. Feasibility studies are under way for projects in the solid waste area. More generally, a major consultancy study for the Department of the Environment and Local Government on legal, financial and technical issues in relation to their pilot project areas is nearing completion. This will enable detailed advice and guidance on PPP projects to be provided to local authorities and the NRA, and will be another important stage in the development of the PPP process in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin light rail project, the target date for the operation of the first two lines is winter 2002. Initial preparatory construction work for the Tallaght line has begun. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise has recently obtained Government approval for a PPP approach to the operation of the project.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006, which was launched in November 1999, clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to the PPP approach. In the plan, PPPs are particularly focused on the economic infrastructure programme. Provision is included for £1.85 billion of PPP funding, including £1 billion for roads, £300 million for public transport and £550 million for environmental projects. This is a minimum target for PPPs. The responsible agencies are already actively identifying possible PPP projects, to follow the pilots above.</P>
    <P>As well as bringing pilot projects to market, further projects are being identified for possible implementation as PPPs. The relocation of the Dublin Institute of Technology to the Grangegorman site is being examined as a potential PPP project. I understand that the National Roads Authority is actively considering a further tranche of PPP roads projects, with the aim of being in a position to announce them as quickly as possible. The PPP fund for local authorities, which will provide seed funding for feasibility studies of possible PPP projects in sectors outside the main programme areas, is also an important and innovative development which will help to bring forward further PPP projects. I may add that the scope for PPPs is also being looked at positively in other areas by other Departments.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also recognises the importance of PPPs in contributing the delivery of the NDP. Under the PPF, elements of an appropriate framework to assess the appropriateness of PPPs and to guide <Col N="372" /> their implementation are to be developed by the PPP advisory group, if possible, within the first six months of the programme. In addition, standard PPP contracts and tendering conditions and procedures will be considered. Through the pilot process and using the effective framework of co-operation already in existence, we can make progress on the commitments relating to PPPs in the PPF.</P>
    <P>Finally, the structures put in place to forward the process are working well. For example, the PPP advisory group has identified key issues to be tackled to facilitate the PPP process. This work is already shaping the roll-out of the process. For instance, in the taxation area, this year's Finance Act includes a significant change to the consortium relief provisions and the Revenue Commissioners have issued tax briefing on key issues. Other recommendations are also being pursued as a matter of urgency by the relevant Departments. Within the public sector, progress is being made on key issues, both within individual Departments and under the aegis of the interdepartmental PPP group.</P>

The setting of official interest rates for the EMU area has been the responsibility of the European Central Bank since 1 January 1999 when the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union began and Ireland and ten other member states adopted the single currency. The ECB enjoys complete independence in relation to monetary policy matters. Retail interest rates are determined by financial institutions themselves according to competitive market conditions.

      <P>As the House is aware from replies to previous questions on this issue, the EU Commission presented a proposed EU Directive on the Taxation of Energy Products in March 1997. The proposed directive has been discussed at working party level and at Ecofin, but it has not been possible to reach agreement on its implementation. There <Col N="373" /> has been no discussion on the proposal during the current presidency and no dates for future meetings are scheduled.</P>
      <P>Ireland has expressed concerns on a number of occasions about the proposed directive. Our concerns related to our peripheral status, the greater dispersal of population which adds to transport costs and the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU versus third countries. My particular concern as Minister for Finance is to ensure that any measure advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such energy tax may have on the Consumer Price Index and how increased tax and new taxes would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>
      <P>The House may also be aware of the proposal from the EU Commission to impose a tax on aviation fuel used in commercial aircraft which was presented and discussed at Ecofin on 13 March 2000. While I expressed reservations regarding the imposition of this tax at the meeting, I understand that this issue may be examined in detail at working party level over the coming months. Pending those discussions, I do not propose to comment further on the issue at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to environmental sustainability. The strategy and investment priorities underpinning the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is to build on the unprecedented economic and social progress of recent years and to strengthen the foundations for further strong and sustainable progress in the years ahead. The plan is designed to strike the correct balance between protecting and preserving the environment, promoting economic growth, improving competitiveness and tackling social exclusion. The protection of the environment is a key priority under the plan and this is addressed, for example, in the £3.6 billion investment in improving water supply, waste water treatment and waste management, more than £2.5 billion in improving public transport as well as investment in areas such as the rural environment protection scheme, the farm waste management scheme and energy efficiency and renewable energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental situation in Ireland is addressed in chapter 13 of the plan and the plan itself has been eco-audited on a pilot scale and the results are set out in appendix 4 of the plan. The main environmental challenges which the plan and other policy measures will address <Col N="374" /> include protecting the urban environment, improving water quality, better management of solid waste and meeting our Kyoto commitment to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. The arrangements for compliance with EU rules on the natural habitats are being addressed in the context of the current negotiations on the community support framework for Ireland 2000-2006 between the Irish authorities and the EU Commission. The plan provides for the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation of operational programmes, the use of environmental criteria in project selection and an environmental co-ordinating committee which will monitor the environmental aspects of the implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>All relevant environmental issues have been discussed with the European Commission in the context of the negotiations on Ireland's Community Support Framework (2000-2006). I anticipate that these negotiations will shortly be concluded to the satisfaction of Ireland and the European Commission.</P>

      <P>As you are aware I announced on 1 June 1999 a list of projects to pilot the PPP process in Ireland. No projects in the Kerry area were included in the first tranche of pilot projects then announced, or in the further pilot projects subsequently selected in the education and water services areas. At this time there are no other PPP proposals being considered for Kerry.</P>
      <P>While my Department is responsible for driving the overall PPP process, it should be noted that the delivery of specific projects is a matter for the Departments and agencies responsible for the relevant investment programmes. The central PPP unit in my Department was set up to lead, drive and co-ordinate the PPP process across and in conjunction with the line Departments of Government. The Departments and authorities directly responsible for each programme area retain the responsibility of bringing forward specific projects, in co-operation with the central PPP unit in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national development plan it is proposed to undertake an ambitious programme of PPP projects between 2000 and 2006, including £1.85 billion of PPP funding. This is a minimum target for PPPs and if further opportunities to avail of private investment can be identified which meet the key criteria of meeting national priorities and demonstrating long-term value for money, they will be pursued. Precise designation of projects or parts of projects for PPP purposes <Col N="375" /> will be decided as the plan is implemented. The responsible agencies are already actively identifying possible PPP projects to follow the pilots already announced.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is seeking an update to the information which I gave on 23 February in reply to a question put down by Deputy Emmet Stagg. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the position at 27 March is as follows. The examination of the 24,095 companies which failed to reply to the notices issued by Revenue remains ongoing. A comparison of these cases with the Companies' Office list of companies which have been struck-off and the receipt of some further replies have reduced the figure for companies which have failed to reply to 20,636. A final scan of the full list involving the checking of the up to date Companies' Office record for companies that may have changed the address of their registered office is now being carried out.</P>
      <P>The 9,389 companies in respect of which the letter was returned to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the addressee is unknown have been checked against the Companies' Office list of companies which have been struck-off. After excluding companies which have already been struck-off by the Companies' Office, the number in this category is reduced to 7,907. The work in establishing whether there are any new addresses for these companies on the Companies' Office record is ongoing and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it was intended to complete all examinations by the end of March, the volume of work <Col N="376" /> has marginally delayed the program and it is now hoped to have a substantial list of companies ready for notification to the registrar by mid-April.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my reply to Deputy Nora Owen on 10 November that, as well as writing to 38,996 incorporated prior to 11 February 1999, Revenue also wrote to 8,397 companies incorporated after that date. In respect of this latter group a list of approximately 3,000 will shortly be sent to the Companies' Office for strike-off consideration by the registrar under the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999.</P>

      <P>The benchmarking exercise will cover both pay and jobs in the public service and across the economy. It will examine and compare job content, duties and responsibilities in both sectors. The examination will also be based on in-depth and comprehensive research, examination and analysis of private sector pay, across a range of employment types and sectors, and will take account of the way reward systems are structured in the private sector. Any increases which might emerge from the exercise will not take effect during the period of this agreement.</P>
      <P>The agreement makes it clear that cross-sectoral relativities are incompatible with the operation of benchmarking and, even within a given sector, traditional or historical relativities between groups will not prevent the benchmarking body from recommending what it considers are appropriate pay rates on the basis of existing circumstances. There will be only one report covering all the groups involved in order to achieve a coherent and integrated approach, and to avoid the problems of the past where an award based on the alleged exceptional circumstances of a particular group quickly led to a spiral of special pay increases right across the public service.</P>
      <P>There is a perception among some public servants that their pay has fallen behind private sector pay, while private sector employees believe that public service pay has increased at a faster rate than theirs. Public service pay cannot evolve in isolation. It has to be set in the context of pay in the wider economy to ensure equity between public service and private sector employees. The proposal to establish a benchmarking body represents a major initiative which is designed to provide a logical and coherent approach going forward on public service pay.</P>

    <P>The social partners welcome the proposed completion of the move to a full tax credit system and regard the tax credit system as an effective and equitable way in which to deliver tax reductions. The social partners believe that the role, which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare system, should be actively examined. They have agreed that a special working group, on the lines of the tax credit working group set up under Partnership <Col N="379" /> 2000, should be established to carry out this examination.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my address to the Institute of Taxation, I outlined the main elements of the substantial programme for tax reductions and reform announced in budget 2000, viz. the personal taxation measures, the amendment and extension of pension fund provisions and the changes in capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>In relation to the establishment of a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer, I explained that this was part of the Government's strategy to reduce the number of taxpayers on the higher rate of tax to 20% as promised in the Government's An Action Plan for the Millennium. I stated that this objective could only be realised by widening the standard rate band and that the best way of achieving this was by individualising the standard rate band so that persons are taxed on what they earn as individuals whether single or married. The measures in budget 2000 will ensure that the number of taxpayers on the top rate will fall by 125,000 in the 2000-01 tax year, from what it otherwise would have been. The new system will also rectify the imbalance in the tax system against most taxpayers who are single or two earner families.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 1.1.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states:</P>
      <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to proceed with the policy of individualisation to secure these objectives which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In the letter, the Commissioner advised that the EU Commission is currently examining the situation from the point of view of the State aid rules of the treaty. The Commissioner stated that the examination does not in principle preclude the Minister for Finance from reforming the credit union tax position. However, the Commissioner noted that any change made to the tax position may lead to different conclusions being arrived at.</P>
      <P>The legal advice available to me is that there is no certainty that the decision on the most recent complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association will be the same as that given on the 1998 complaint which specifically related to the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions.</P>

Any change in the law at this point, which would give special treatment to the credit unions, could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it is both rational and logical to take the view that if credit union interest and dividends are not taxed either in the hands of the credit union, as is currently the case, nor in the hands of credit union members as is proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the same conclusion reached in 1998 by the Commission can no longer be reached.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994-99 programming period ongoing evaluation of the nine operational programmes was carried out by a combination of a central evaluation unit for the Community Support Framework, CSF, a separate evaluation unit for each of the operational programmes for human resources, industry and agriculture and rural development and external consultants for the remaining operational programmes. The National Development Plan 2000-06 proposed a rationalisation of these arrangements to provide for a central evaluation unit to carry out ongoing evaluation of the plan and the new community support framework. It also allows for commissioning of external consultants where the central evaluation unit might not have sufficient expertise to carry out particular evaluations. Rationalisation of the evaluation arrangements is taking place to reflect the new programming structure and to build on best practice lessons learned from the 1994-99 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ongoing evaluation of European Social Fund co-financed activities, along with other Structural Funds co-financed activities and public expenditure generally under the national plan, will be carried out under the new arrangements. While the <Col N="382" /> central evaluation unit will be under the aegis of my Department, it will be independent in its functions. The work programme for the unit will be determined by a technical assistance monitoring committee which will comprise, among others, representatives of the managing authorities for the plan, CSF and new operational programmes, namely, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Environment and Local Government and the regional assemblies and the European Commission (DG Regio and DG Empl) in an observer-advisory capacity.</P>
    <P>The setting of terms of reference for evaluations and exercising of quality control in relation to them will be carried out by small steering committees comprising representatives of the managing authorities and implementing bodies and technical experts, as appropriate. The steering committee for evaluations of ESF co-financed activities and employment and human resources policy generally will be chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In recognition of the significance of this element of the plan and CSF, provision will be made in the staffing of the new central evaluation unit for dedicated resources to be assigned to the ESF evaluation function. The staff dedicated to ESF related evaluations will be under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will undertake the evaluations under the general direction and control of the manager of the central evaluation unit.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to set up an independent body to allocate lottery funds. The Government set up a review group in 1996 to consider national lottery funding and procedures. The group furnished its report in May 1997. It recommended that the allocation of national lottery funds for purposes approved by the Government should continue to be made by the Government rather than by an independent body.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to explain how the lottery allocations are made. The allocations to each department are decided by the Government subject to Dáil approval in the context of the annual Estimates for public spending. A special appendix listing the lottery-funded subheads is included in the Book of Estimates. Ministers must then account to the Dáil for the spending of the lottery monies on their Vote just as they do any other monies. The lottery subheads are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and included in his report to the Dáil. Thus there is a high level of transparency and accountability in the present system.</P>

      <P>The common chapter in the national development plan was drafted in agreement with the Northern Ireland authorities. It sets out a range of areas which both sides agree are suitable for cross-Border co-operation. The Community Support Frameworks for Ireland and Northern Ireland currently under negotiation with the European Commission will also contain proposals for North-South co-operation consistent with the common chapter.</P>
      <P>In addition, the PEACE Operational Programme 2000-2004 and the North-South Interreg Community Initiative 2000-2006 will also contain significant financial EU co-funded provisions in the area of North-South co-operation. The special EU programmes body will be the managing authority for both the PEACE OP and Interreg.</P>

The Irish Mortgage and Savings Association has made a complaint in relation to the current tax treatment of credit unions. This complaint alleges that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of their exemption from corporation tax and from DIRT.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendations contained in the ESRI's Quarterly Economic Commentary. The Irish economy continues its exceptional performance and the Government is committed to ensuring that this relatively strong progress is maintained. The Government will continue to use fiscal policy, as necessary, to this end.</P>
      <P>I agree with the ESRI that the competitiveness of the economy is a key concern. Maintaining competitive wage levels was a key objective of the recently agreed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF.</P>
      <P>The ESRI also highlights pressures in the housing market. Increasing the supply of housing remains the Government's main policy response to the sharp increase in prices. Last year almost 50,000 houses were built, an increase of over 100% since 1993.</P>
      <P>The tax cuts which will come into effect next month are part of a medium term strategy to deliver ongoing, sustainable, pay increases and to increase the incentive to work, which will add to the numbers of people joining the labour force and help ease the tight labour market.</P>
      <P>Despite these tax reductions, the budget will continue in significant surplus into the medium term. The commitments in the programme are predicated on the Government continuing to run significant budget surpluses, a key factor underlying the prevailing high level of confidence in the management of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation ) Act, 1993, provides that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs shall manage and control the current account of the social insurance fund and that the Minister for Finance shall manage and control the investment account of the fund. The current account is used to meet the on-going expenditure requirements of the fund and any sums standing to the credit of the account are transferred to the investment account. Whenever the resources in the current account are insufficient to meet its liabilities, funds are transferred from the investment account to meet these liabilities.</P>
      <P>For many years, the social insurance fund was in deficit and required a subvention from the Exchequer to meet its liabilities. However, in recent years, a surplus has developed which is expected to continue for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment account of the social insurance fund is held in the Central Bank and attracts the appropriate overnight interest rate. In order to <Col N="386" /> improve the rate of return for the fund, it was decided, last year, to invest part of the surplus in an Exchequer Note with the National Treasury Management Agency. Currently, some £287 million is invested in this manner, which is considered to strike the appropriate balance between security and return considerations. The remainder of the surplus, the value of which fluctuates on a daily basis depending on cash flow requirements, remains on overnight deposit in the Central Bank. As cash flow requirements permit, it is expected that further tranches of this surplus will also be put into an Exchequer Note to attract a higher interest rate.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to know that, under the NTMA (Amendment) Bill currently being drafted, it is proposed to give NTMA a formal investment management role which will enable them to manage Government funds where the relevant Minister requires such a service.</P>

To date, the director has approved codes for IBEC, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association and the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland, Irish Branch.</P>
      <P>Subscribers to either the national code or to approved codes will be entitled to display a logo. Display of the logo will inform consumers that the subscribers in question have agreed to undertake the commitments under the national code or approved codes; and the logo will include a contact point for use by consumers in any case where they consider that the commitments are not being adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although dual pricing is already happening in many instances, both the National Code and approved codes provide for dual pricing at minimum from 1 October 2001, that is, three months before euro notes and coins come into circulation <Col N="387" /> on 1 January 2002, until one month after the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins. Dual display of prices will form part of overall communications strategies designed to facilitate the changeover by consumers to the euro. In that connection, publicity about the national code and approved codes will be a feature of the euro campaign which is being planned by the Director of Consumer Affairs, and consumers will be urged to shop only where they see the logo displayed.</P>
    <P>Promoting awareness of the euro generally among consumers is currently one of the key objectives of the European Consumer Centre, ECC, which is co-funded by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the European Commission. In June 1999 the ECC published a free guide, entitled The Euro and You: A Consumer's Guide. The guide aims to raise awareness among the public of some of the practical aspects of the changeover affecting consumers, including buying goods and services, payment of social welfare benefits, wages, banking services, pensions, insurance and travel. The guide was distributed nation-wide through, e.g., Consumer Information Centres and Money Advice Bureaux. As the first run, 15,000 copies has been exhausted, the guide has now been reprinted. In addition, the ECC recently published a shorter guide to the euro, which is also free of charge and which is aimed at helping older consumers in particular to become familiar with the new currency. This information leaflet features some typical grocery items, with prices in euro as well as in Irish pounds and it sets out the EU rules for carrying out conversions between Irish pounds and the euro.</P>
    <P>Both publications are available too on the ECC's website, the address of which is www.ecic.ie.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the euro section of the ECC's website has now been adapted, with assistance from the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, to be fully accessible to the blind and visually impaired.</P>
    <P>The foregoing information is intended to give the Deputy an indication of actions taken to date in the interests of consumers. Further consolidation of the progress made can be expected, as the momentum towards the introduction of the euro increases. I am determined to ensure that there will be no information deficit for consumers, and that the changeover to the euro will not give rise to unwarranted price increases in any area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 64 <Col N="388" /> today, I have sought to inform the Deputy about the current state of play in relation to both the national code of practice on dual display of prices, and to complementary codes on dual pricing devised by business organisations and approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs. I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs intends to hold discussions with the social partners, in particular IBEC, to ensure all business sectors have subscribed to, or intend to subscribe to, either the national code or an approved sectoral code. In addition, and quite apart from codes, I am sure the Deputy will have noted that dual display of prices is becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors, ranging from till receipts in supermarkets and bank statements to tax-free allowance certificates, utility bills, TV licences and so on. In terms of awareness-raising, I might mention two initiatives. The Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign has produced a number of new guides to assist further Irish businesses with preparations for changeover for the euro. Second, the European Commission has now launched the final phase of its euro communications campaign, which will focus on SMEs. All in all, the momentum towards dual pricing may be expected to gather pace this year and to intensify next year.</P>

      <Quest> her views on whether the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour could have a negative impact on those on rehabilitive placement in supported employment or Rehab employment as productivity with or without support can vary considerably from 10% upwards and employers will now be less inclined to employ these people; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the introduction of the minimum wage to have a negative impact on people in rehabilitative employment.</P>
      <P>The employment support scheme, which is currently operated by the National Rehabilitation Board, provides a wage subsidy to employers in respect of people with disabilities whose productivity levels are between 50% and 80% of normal performance. This subsidy covers the shortfall in productivity. The scheme allows for <i>pro rata</i> increases in the subsidy as a result of wage increases. There should therefore be no disincentive to the employment of people with disabilities in enterprises to which the minimum wage applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's strategy to encourage the employment of people with disabilities in the future, my Department has committed, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to vigorously promote the employment support scheme following its forthcoming transfer <Col N="389" /> from the NRB to FÁS and to increase funding for the scheme over the period of the partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards Rehab employment, a separate subsidy is paid in respect of people in a sheltered employment programme under the pilot employment programme for people with disabilities. This subsidy, which is currently paid through the NRB, was increased from £8,520 per person per annum to £9,000 per person per annum from 1 January this year on the basis of a submission from the Rehab group which focused on wage increases.</P>
    <P>I would also like to add that, in the context of the wider labour market, the Employment Equality Act outlaws discrimination against people with disabilities in relation to access to and conditions of employment.</P>

FÁS provides funds through the community employment scheme to allow participants to pay for computer courses. Secondly, direct grants are available through the FÁS placement services to enable unemployed persons to avail of training under a customised training fund.</P>
      <P>In addition, a wide range of information technology training is provided for unemployed people through FÁS's mainstream training programmes. A significant proportion of this training is subcontracted out. For example, in 1999, 37% of FÁS IT courses were delivered by private providers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position with regard to organophosphates by reference to the areas of pesticides plant protection and veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any ban in the UK on the use of organophosphates in plant protection. A review of the registrations for plant protection products containing a number of organophosphate compounds is under way in the UK.</P>
      <P>Because of concerns in relation to possible risks for consumers, in 1998 I initiated a review of the registrations for pesticides containing the organophosphate active substances chlorfenvinphos, demeton-S-methyl, demeton-S-methylsulfone, disulfoton, phorate and quinalaphos. Only in the case of chlorfenvinphos was the data necessary for the purposes of the review submitted. The registrations for plant protection products containing the other five active substances were revoked with effect from 15 September 1998. An EU initiative involving the review of all organophosphates used for plant protection in the EU has overtaken the review of chlorfenvinphos.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000 of 28 February 2000, laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the work programme referred to in Article 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (OJ No L55/25 of 29 February 2000), a review of all organophoshate compounds used in plant protection, as well as certain other compounds, has been initiated. That regulation designated Ireland as rapporteur for three of the 70 organophosphate compounds to be reviewed, fonofos, temephos and mephosfolan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competent authority in Ireland under veterinary medicines legislation for the approval of organophosphate sheep dips is the Irish Medicines Board. This approval process covers the quality, safety and efficacy of the particular product in question. I understand that the IMB is currently engaged in reviewing the report of the UK Committee on Toxicity in order to determine what action, if any, will be required in this coun<Col N="395" /> try, particularly in relation to the safety of users of concentrated product.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, this scheme is administered on a day to day basis by the Revenue Commissioners, who, under the regulations, may consider an application for relief only where a primary medical certificate had been issued to the person concerned by the senior area medical officer employed by the appropriate health board. This certificate confirms that the person fulfils the medical criteria laid down in the statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>I must confirm to the Deputy that neither my Department nor Revenue has any role in the medical assessment of the person nor in the issue of the certificates.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central public finances, that is Exchequer receipts and payments, are accounted for on a cash basis. The constitutional and statutory provisions on which the Oireachtas levies taxation and appro<Col N="398" /> priates amounts for financing public services are cash based and consequently reports to the Dáil on receipts and expenditure must also be cash based. Since 1996 however the annual appropriation accounts prepared by Departments have been enhanced by the inclusion of some accruals features.</P>
      <P>A second line of accountability for Government expenditure exists through the EU. The General Government Balance is the system used by the European Commission and which it requires us to use. This is calculated using the European System of Accounts 1995 version, ESA95.</P>
      <P>Both measures of budgetary arithmetic count as income for Exchequer revenues arising in connection with the depletion of natural resources, to which I assume the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The ESA95 methodology does not envisage the making of provisions to reflect the depletion of natural resources, nor can such provisions be made in the Exchequer accounts, which measure flows of receipts and payments only. Exchequer outlays which are connected with the countering or treatment of pollution are recorded as expenditure under both budget definitions. Where pollution which has been caused by a third party is cleared up by a State agency, and the third party is charged for the clearing up, the payment is required to be recorded as income under ESA95 rules and as a cash receipt in the Exchequer accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government entered the talks on a new national programme with a number of key objectives in relation to public service pay. These included the need to tackle the issue of cross-sectoral relativities, to establish a greater link between pay and performance, and to advance the process of public service modernisation.</P>
      <P>The public service pay agreement which was negotiated as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a public service benchmarking body to undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public service employees<i> vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. It makes it clear that cross-sectoral relativities are incompatible with the operation of benchmarking, and that even within a given sector, traditional or historical relativities between groups will not prevent the benchmarking body from recommending what it considers are appropriate pay rates on the basis of existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement also establishes a clear link between the payment of the third phase increase <Col N="399" /> of 4% and the achievement of specific sectoral performance targets under the public service modernisation programme. It makes it clear that performance indicators have to be established in each sector by 1 April 2001 and the targets have to be achieved by 1 April 2002, with progress having being assessed at organisational level by 1 October 2002.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives to be achieved under the next phase of the public service modernisation programme is the design and implementation of performance management systems in each sector of the public service. In the civil service, a new performance management system has already been designed in consultation with staff and unions and, following the recent ratification of the programme, this system will now be implemented in each Department and office. While the programme does not address under-performance specifically, proposals in relation to this matter are currently being developed in the context of the SMI process. These proposals will follow the normal consultative process.</P>
    <P>The programme also acknowledges the need to examine issues such as new forms of work organisation embracing innovative work practices, multi-grade and cross-stream teams, and flexibility in grading, including broad-banding, complemented by imaginative reward and recognition systems including an examination of gainsharing. It recognises that these issues are likely to arise in any event from the benchmarking exercise.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that the new programme addresses each of the key objectives mentioned above in a constructive and balanced way, and provides a logical and coherent approach going forward.</P>

The EU aspect, which affects any taxation proposals, was also discussed at this meeting. Deputies will be aware that there are ongoing complaints with the EU Commission. The Irish Mortgage and Savings Association has made a complaint in relation to the current tax treatment of credit unions. This complaint alleges that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of their exemption from corporation tax and from DIRT.

However, the Commissioner noted that any change made to the tax position may lead to different conclusions being arrived at. Consequently, any change in the law, at this point, which would give special treatment to the credit unions, could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The legal advice available to me is that there is no certainty that the decision on the most recent complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association will be the same as that given on the 1998 complaint which specifically related to the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by the Taoiseach in his statement following the meeting with the Irish League of Credit Unions, there are also general equity aspects which must be considered in relation to all financial institutions as well as ensuring the integrity of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the chairman of the working group on the taxation of the returns of credit union savings will be further examined in the light of whatever decision the EU Commission takes in relation to the complaints about existing tax law. I am advised that it is both rational and logical to take the view that if credit union interest and dividends are not taxed either in the hands of the credit union, as is currently the case, nor in the hands of credit union members as is proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the same conclusion reached in 1998 by the Commission can no longer be reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month, the CSO published a document entitled Household Incomes, Regions and Counties, 1991-1997. This publication provided estimates of household incomes at regional assembly &ndash; NUTS II &ndash; regional authority &ndash; NUTS III &ndash; and county levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These estimates indicated that, over the seven <Col N="401" /> year period 1991-97, there was stability in the relative position of the two NUTS II regions, with disposable income per head remaining at 91% of the national average in the Border, midlands and western region and at 103% in the southern and eastern region.</P>
    <P>Within the BMW region, there was very little change in the relative income position of regional authority &ndash; NUTS III &ndash; areas <i>vis-à-vis </i>the national average. However, there was a perceptible change within the NUTS regions of the southern and eastern region, with the mid-east showing a marked improvement in relative position.</P>
    <P>Care must be exercised in interpreting the meaning of these results in terms of living standards and quality of life across regions and counties. In the first place, the estimation of household incomes, even at national level, is, I am informed, an inexact statistical science and the smaller the geographic area which is covered, the more inexact it becomes. Secondly, to get a view of relative living standards, you would need to assess incomes in each area in the light of living costs there.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, despite the reservations to which they are subject, the figures published by the CSO clearly indicate that there are imbalances in incomes and living standards within and between regions. In particular, the imbalance between the southern and eastern region and the BMW region justifies the successful strategy of the Government to retain Objective One status for the latter region. Consistent with this strategy, the Government has identified better balanced regional development, both between and within regions, as a fundamental objective of the NDP.</P>

    <P>The fall in the National Debt at end-December 1998 was due to an Exchequer surplus of IR£747 <Col N="402" /> million, a favourable foreign exchange impact and other nominal movements.</P>
    <P>The increase in the debt between 1998 and 1999 reflects the accounting effect of the securities exchange programme and the absorption of FEOGA debt &ndash; IR£375 million into the national debt. The securities exchange programme was carried out by the NTMA in 1999 in order to ensure the competitiveness of Irish Government bonds in the new euro trading environment. Under the programme old bonds with a high interest coupon were exchanged for a larger nominal amount of new bonds with a lower interest coupon close to current market rates. If the impact of these exceptional items is excluded the debt would have fallen by circa IR£1,360 million in 1999, principally due to the Exchequer surplus of IR£1,192 million. However, the increase in debt due to the programme will be compensated for by a reduction in debt service costs as lower coupons are paid on the increased amount of debt. In other words, the market value of the debt is not affected by the exchange of bonds. The overall effect of the programme is that the Exchequer should be able to raise funds at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The payment in 1999 of IR£3,015 million, comprising of a proportion of Telecom receipts and a contribution of 1% of GNP, to the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities is not reflected in the figures set out above. Legislation is currently being prepared by my Department for the part-prefunding of future public pension liabilities. Moneys in the temporary holding fund will be utilised for these purposes upon enactment of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The euro came into being in cashless form on 1 January 1999 and euro notes and coins will be introduced on 1 January 2002. The changeover to euro in 2002 will require an adequate supply of euro currency, appropriate preparations by the public sector and by businesses, satisfactory arrangements for the cash changeover and widescale provision of information for the public. All member states in the euro area are working to ensure that the changeover will take place as smoothly as possible. The pace of preparations is expected to increase now that the year 2000 problem has passed and 1 January 2002 is coming closer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, production of euro currency began in September 1999 and I am assured by the Central Bank that adequate supplies will be available for the changeover. In the public sector, each Department is responsible for the changeover to the euro in its operations and for making sure as <Col N="403" /> appropriate that adequate arrangements are put in place by the bodies under its aegis. Departments have assured me that they are satisfied that they and the bodies under their aegis will be ready for the changeover.</P>
    <P>As regards business preparations, the most recent survey on the preparedness of Irish business undertaken by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign was published last month. The survey found that in general terms firms are advancing with preparations for the changeover, though slowly. The Forfás campaign warned in publishing the survey that Irish companies could risk increased changeover costs by delaying their preparations until 1 January 2002. It is of course primarily the responsibility of companies themselves to ensure that they make adequate preparations for the changeover. The Forfás campaign has already distributed very large quantities of information for business as well as undertaking a wide-ranging programme of activities to raise awareness among the business community in co-operation with business and professional organisations and State agencies, and will continue to do so.  </P>
    <P>Work is ongoing under the aegis of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, which I set up in 1998, on the practical arrangements for the changeover to euro cash in 2002 and I expect to be able to make an announcement in this regard over the coming weeks. The board has already provided widescale information for the public on the euro and is working with a range of organisations with a view to increasing public awareness. Its public information work will continue and greatly intensify as we approach 1 January 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions is seeking the implementation of the recommendations of the chairman of the working group on the taxation of credit union savings. The chairman recommended a certain amount of tax-free savings for credit unions as follows: a continuation of the corporation tax exemption for credit unions; the first £375 of credit union members dividend income to be exempt from tax; any excess of dividends over £375 up to £750 to be subject to 20% tax; where dividends are over £750 the entire dividend to be taxed at 20%; all interest on deposits to be taxed at the 20% DIRT rate and no reporting of dividends or interest by credit unions to Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot ignore the risk of tax evasion where there are non-reportable tax free accounts in certain institutions. This issue has come to light <Col N="404" /> in recent times, most notably in the Committee of Public Accounts report into DIRT, and it has been shown that when a certain level of interest income was exempt from tax in the past, a serious problem of tax evasion arose through the use of multiple accounts in different banks and branches and/or in different names including those of relations and children. There is also general equity aspects which must be considered in relation to all financial institutions and any concessions given to credit union savers would inevitably lead to demands by corresponding savers with other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is also the issue of the complaint which has been made to the EU Commission by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. This complaint relates to the current tax treatment of credit unions and their exemption from corporation tax and from DIRT. In 1998, the Commission previously dealt with a complaint regarding the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions. The EU Commission decided not to regard this exemption as a State aid. I believe, a key consideration, which influenced their decision, is the fact that, at present, the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. If both the credit union and its members were exempt from taxation, as the league are campaigning for, such a proposal would have to be referred to the Commission for clearance. The Commission is dealing with the existing tax position of credit unions. If the existing position has triggered a complaint, it would be reasonable to assume that further concessions, as sought by the credit union movement, would trigger further complaints which would have to be dealt with also.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste met with the league on 24 February last. At this meeting, the league accepted the Government's position that complaints on taxation made to the European Commission must be resolved before any further moves are made in regard to the taxation of credit union savings income. Any change in the law at this point, which would give special treatment to the credit unions, could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, that the disabled person meets the medical criteria specified in the regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an employee of the local health board. In cases where the issue of the primary medical certificate is refused on the basis that the medical criteria are not met, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</P>

      <P>Organophosphates are used widely for a variety of purposes including use as ingredients in human medicines, veterinary medicines, plant pesticides, the chemical industry and the horticultural industry. Figures therefore in relation to illness and deaths caused by organophosphate poisoning in each of the past five years are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft report is currently being prepared by the Irish Medicines Board in relation to organophosphate sheep-dips which is the primary area of organophosphate use encountered by the board. The board has indicated that there were no validated reports in humans in Ireland of suspected adverse drug reactions to organophos-<Col N="408" /> phate sheep-dips in 1998 or in 1999. One unvalidated report in 1999 and two in 1998 related to organophosphate exposure but did not contain sufficient details to constitute valid reports as required by European Union guidelines and causality assessment was therefore not possible. This compared to two reports of adverse reactions received during the period 1996 to 1997.</P>
    <P>A recent published report of a fatality in a horticultural worker handling a slow release organophosphate pellet for pesticidal use has been investigated by the Health and Safety Authority but I understand that a definite causality has not been assigned to use of the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school ser<Col N="410" /> vices and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service, rather than to register. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    <P>The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and-or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.</P>
    <P>Where deficiencies are identified, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction i.e. not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months, exceptionally, a longer period may be allowed.</P>
    <P>Precise information on the number of child care places lost as a result of established playgroups being unable to comply with the regulations is not readily available in my Department. I have requested it from the health boards and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care over the next seven years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the child care measures which were announced in budget 2000. The main objective of the new measures is an increase in the quantity of child care places and an improvement in the quality of services available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to health and safety all significant research in this area is monitored here by the <Col N="411" /> Department of Public Enterprise with whom my Department liaises in regard to the human health aspects. The balance of scientific and medical research to date has not conclusive established a causal link between electric and magnetic fields associated with mobile phone masts and any significant public health risk.</P>
    <P>Mobile phone companies here are required to operate within emission levels set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. An audit of licensed telecommunications operators was carried out for the Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulations by Enterprise Ireland during 1999. The audit report was published recently and showed that all the companies audited are in compliance with the levels set by ICNIRP for general public exposure to non-ionising radiation.</P>
    <P>Research is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields. This project is being carried out over a five year period and will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments. The European Union under its fifth framework research programme has allocated 160 million for international research projects in this area.</P>
    <P>At EU level the Council of Health Ministers agreed a recommendation on public exposure to electromagnetic fields. This measure provides for the establishment of a system of ongoing monitoring of the ambient exposure of the public to electromagnetic fields from all sources including power lines and mobile phone equipment. An appropriate monitoring arrangement is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Should conclusive evidence emerge of an unacceptable public health risk, I would seek to have remedial measures put in place by the appropriate Departments and agencies.</P>

As already advised to the House, the Adoption Board is an independent statutory body established under the Adoption Act, 1952, and is responsible for the administration of adoption law. As the primary body responsible for adoption matters, it has developed a specialised knowledge of the issues surrounding adoption both domestic and intercountry. Its experience <Col N="412" /> and expertise in this area is well established.

      <P>It is the intention to further expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in the 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways with the publication this year of a further policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and waste recovery generally.

      <P>This policy statement will be informed by the recently published national waste database report for 1998. This indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that while the amount of municipal waste recycled rose by 42% since 1995 to nearly 167,000 tonnes, the overall recycling rate for this waste stream was 9%. An estimated 2.1 million tonnes of reported industrial waste was recovered in 1998, a recovery rate of 26.6%.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area. The limits take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents regarding average rents charged in the area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the health boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority revised their rent levels, with effect from 1 January 2000. The maximum rent level for a couple or lone parent with one child was raised from £476 per month to £600 per month. The maximum rent level for similar families with two or more children living in a three bedroomed house is set at £700 per month. Families with more children requiring 4 or more bedrooms for their family size will have an individual rate set for their particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>All the health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am of course aware of the tabloid newspaper article referred to by the Deputy which is misleading. I reject the suggestion contained in the article that the prisoners in question are living in what are described as &ldquo;luxury bungalows&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The prisoners in question are held in a group in a compound within the walls of Castlerea Prison which has been in operation for over three years. Accommodation within the compound is actually quite basic and there are no grounds for describing it as a &ldquo;luxury bungalow&rdquo;. Over most of this period prisoners held in the Castlerea complex have had access to kitchens in the houses where they prepared their own meals and to cardphones which they operate at their own expense. This is not at all unusual in an Irish prison context.</P>
      <P>In fact virtually all food consumed in our prisons is prepared substantially by prisoners themselves albeit with considerable staff supervision in the larger units.</P>
      <P>My unaltered position is that these prisoners will have to serve the full sentences imposed on them by the courts for their role in the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. It is not, however, inconsistent with that approach that the prisoners in question should be held in less intensive settings from a security point of view than Portlaoise Prison, which is our sole maximum security prison.</P>

      <P>It is generally acknowledged that there is an information gap in respect of the number of child care places available in this country and the demand for child care provision. In an effort to address this problem, my Department and the European Social Fund has commissioned ADM Limited to develop a national child care census and database of group settings i.e. all child care facilities and services excluding individual childminders. This project involves the co-ordination of a national child care census and the establishment of a database on child care facilities in Ireland and will provide information about the range, extent and location of services currently available in terms of quantity and quality. The county by county reports of the child care database will provide much needed facts and figures and for the first time baseline statistics on groups based child care facilities in Ireland will be available. The database will facilitate analysis of future demand for child care services.</P>
      <P>Work on the individual county reports is almost complete and I intend to publish the full reports which will be available to county libraries and county child care committees as a reference document and an executive summary will be available to the public.</P>
      <P>In addition, an interdepartmental group has been established which focuses on co-operation and co-ordinating between Departments and State agencies which have a role in childcare funding or training. This group will put in place mechanisms whereby the benefits of child care funding across Departments will be measured in terms of the numbers of child care places established and the quality of child care services and training.</P>
      <P>These measures will assist in developing baseline statistics which will be used for planning the continuing development of child care provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department <Col N="420" /> has been allocated £250 million to develop child care provision over the next seven years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The funding will support my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, details of which I announced in December 1999. The criteria and the eligibility requirements for the measures within the programme are being developed at present and it is intended to promote some of the initiatives in the coming weeks, at which stage detailed information leaflets and application forms will be available from the equal opportunities child care section of my Department.</P>
    <P>The initiatives that will be funded by my Department include the following measures. Expansion of the equal opportunities child care programme combining the following aspects capital grants to community based-not for profit organisations to support the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of child care facilities; staffing grants to assist community based-not for profit projects to fund the salary costs of child care workers; training supports designed to improve and expand the provision of child care training and support for innovative projects in the child care area.</P>
    <P>Funding will also be provided towards the development of local child care network  initiatives to provide mutual support for providers and facilitate the dissemination of information and learning materials thereby assisting the provision of a high quality service to parents and children as well as developmental support for the national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
    <P>A further element will be the provision of a new capital grant scheme for self-employed child care providers up to 20 child care places, to assist in establishing and upgrading their facilities thus helping them to provide a better quality environment for children under their care.</P>
    <P>My Department has also been given the responsibility to co-ordinate child care in the context of the national development plan. My Department has established and is chairing a National Co-ordinating Child Care Committee which will oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in a co-ordinated manner throughout the country. The interdepartmental synergies group mentioned above was established in February of this year and over the course of the coming months county child care committees will also be established to advance the provision of childcare facilities on a county basis.</P>
    <P>In budget 2000 it was also announced that the Finance Bill will provide for accelerated capital allowances at the rate of 100% in the first year on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre School Services) Regulations, 1996. The allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission. The relief applies to all child care facilities whether provided by employers or commercial child care operators and the reliefs can be used by owners of the facilities or by investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements, subject to the normal tax rules which apply to such investors. The change will take <Col N="421" /> effect in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999.</P>
    <P>Further funding has been provided for child care in budget 2000 to the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science for the development of out-of-school hours child care services; to provide grants to schools which set up and run after-school child care services and establishment of an advisory service by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Through the co-ordination structure, a system will be put in place to monitor the increase in the number of child care places and the improvement in quality arising from expenditure on child care provision by all State agencies.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that these child care measures together with the increased co-operation and co-ordination between the voluntary and private sectors and statutory agencies in the child care area will not only lead to an increase in the quantity of child care places but also in the quality of service provision.</P>

      <P>I fully recognise the staffing difficulties in the Probation and Welfare Service. Indeed, on coming into office I found the staffing situation to be unsatisfactory and instigated a root and branch review of the service. I arranged for an expert group to examine the service gener<Col N="422" /> ally and in particular the staffing requirements of the service. On foot of the expert group's recommendations in relation to staffing, I secured Department of Finance sanction for an additional 39 staff for the service. I understand that the recruitment of these staff is well under way and that offers of assignment have been made by the Civil Service Commission to over 40 candidates following a recent recruitment competition conducted by them.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in the period 1 June 1999 to date 13 probation and welfare officers have been recruited to the Probation and Welfare Service from the two recent competitions. Recruitment will continue until all vacancies and the new posts have been filled.</P>
      <P>In relation to streamlining of the recruitment process the position is that recommendations made by my Department to the Civil Service Commission have resulted in a situation whereby a certain amount of documentation pertaining to candidates is processed prior to interview stage of recruitment competitions. Every effort will be made to further streamline the recruitment process. In addition, a review of the operational staffing requirement of the service will be conducted shortly.</P>
      <P>I should add that to strengthen the Probation and Welfare Service overall I have increased the budget allocation from £16.9 million to £19.9 million this year.</P>

      <P>There are two special classes in the Mullingar area catering for children with speech and language disorders. One of these classes is located in the school to which the Deputy refers. The other special class is based in The Downs national school. These special classes operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 7:1 and are therefore capable of catering for up to 14 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as a junior school, the school to which he refers only caters for children from junior infants to second class.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have specific data on the number of children in the County Westmeath area awaiting admission to such classes. However, any application from a school in the area for the establishment of such a class will be given every consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that such classes can only be established in close co-operation with the relevant health board which has responsibility for providing the necessary speech and language therapy services for such children. The availability of such services on a full-time basis is vital to the success of such special classes.</P>

      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year those who also have a grade C or higher in honours Irish at the leaving certificate, or its equivalent, are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity. These arrangements were introduced in order to address a temporary shortage of trained teachers at primary level.</P>
      <P>Substitute teachers are generally employed for short periods on a casual basis to replace teachers who are on paid leave of absence. Temporary teachers tend to be employed for longer periods as replacements for teachers absent on unpaid leave such as career breaks, and accordingly it is deemed necessary for them to have a minimum proficiency in the Irish language.</P>
