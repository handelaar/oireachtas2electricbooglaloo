    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the Dáil on Wednesday 15 December, I attended the European Council in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December. The agenda for the meeting was ambitious and a number of potentially contentious issues were discussed. I am pleased that progress was made on all of these matters.</P>
      <P>In relation to enlargement, the European Council decided that the accession negotiation process should now include all 12 accession countries on an equal footing, each to be judged on its own merits. The Council also confirmed that the Union should be in a position to welcome new member states from end 2002. In addition, we successfully found a formula to include Turkey as a candidate country, while recognising the necessity for all candidates to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria before entering negotiations.</P>
      <P>The meeting also discussed the forthcoming intergovernmental conference. It was agreed that it should be convened in early February and conclude by the end of this year. It is likely to convene on 14 February. The agenda will focus primarily on the three Amsterdam leftovers: size and composition of the commission; the weighting of votes in the Council; the possible extension of qualified majority voting as well as a small number of related institutional changes. Other items may come on the agenda as negotiations proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following from the Cologne European Council, an issue of key interest to Ireland at the summit was the common European policy on security and defence. The report by the Presidency on this issue rightly made clear that the EU's engagement relates to Petersberg Tasks and not to the <Col N="4" /> so-called Article 5 issues of mutual defence. It was also important for us that the EU at the highest level be seen to support the United Nations and recognise the primary role of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. At my request the conclusions reflect that fundamental point.</P>
    <P>Two main areas were addressed from Ireland's point of view, capabilities and decision making structures. In essence, as to capabilities it was agreed that member states would be able by 2003 to deploy a force of between 50,000 and 60,000 capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks. I should stress that participation by any member state will be on a case by case basis as individual missions arise. I also emphasise that what is involved is not a standing European army and the conclusions from the Council explicitly recognise that this is the case.</P>
    <P>My first visit abroad this year was an official visit to Lesotho on 10 January, followed by an official visit to South Africa from 11 to 14 January. In Lesotho, I met Prime Minister Mosisili who was accompanied by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Education and Natural Resources. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation for Ireland's development assistance to his country during the past 25 years. We had a discussion on important regional issues and I took the opportunity to highlight Ireland's campaign for the Security Council. He assured me of his commitment to political reforms and the strengthening of democratic institutions within Lesotho. I also made a courtesy call on King Letsie III.</P>
    <P>I was happy to perform the official opening of the new offices of the Consulate of Ireland in Maseru, where I had the opportunity to meet political figures from Lesotho, religious leaders, members of the Irish community, particularly those working on development projects, and members of the international development aid community. I travelled with several members of the Lesotho Cabinet to visit remote areas of the country where Ireland Aid has been working to improve the lives of the people in very fundamental ways. I visited projects which are developing the social and economic infrastructure of the country and providing drinking water, education and health care facilities.</P>
    <P>In South Africa, I met President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy President Jacob Zuma. Discussions focused on: the experience of South Africa since the end of the apartheid era in 1994 and the current programme of economic and social transition; the Northern Ireland peace process &ndash; I expressed my thanks for the role played by South Africa in supporting its progress in so many ways; Ireland's economic performance and potential for the further development of bilateral trade; the EU-South Africa Trade Agreement; and regional African issues. I received thanks for Ireland's support for the anti-apartheid movement and for Ireland's ongoing development co-operation assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> On my visit to South Africa I was accompanied by a 20 member business delegation and I was happy to meet their South African business partners and to explore with them possibilities for developing trade, investment and partnerships between the two countries. At an Enterprise Ireland business breakfast in Johannesburg I addressed 150 business people on the subject of Ireland's economic performance and the development of economic relations between Ireland and South Africa.</P>
    <P>In both Johannesburg and Capetown I visited development co-operation projects which are supported by Ireland Aid, mainly in the area of justice, reconciliation and support for at-risk groups. I was struck by the enormity of the problem posed by the HIV virus and AIDS, not only in the countries I visited but, as was pointed out to me, all over Africa. Ireland Aid is already supporting a number of projects in this area. I welcome the launch yesterday of an Ireland Aid strategy on HIV/AIDS. This is aimed at increasing and making more coherent Ireland Aid's support for programmes to prevent and treat the disease. The strategy also addresses its socio-economic consequences for communities in poor countries where the incidence may be as high as 50% or more. I will remain in close contact with the European Commission and other member states regarding the EU's development aid programmes and their contribution to alleviating the problem of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>I addressed the South African Institute of International Affairs on the Northern Ireland peace process. I visited Robben Island prison in the company of Mr. Ahmed Kathrada who was imprisoned there with Nelson Mandela. The conditions during their time were very difficult but Mr. Kathrada told me that they drew inspiration from the support they received from around the world, including support from Ireland. I also met members of the Irish community in South Africa in both Pretoria and Capetown.</P>
    <P>With regard to my EU and international related programme until the end of June, I plan to visit Australia and the United States from 9 to 18 March. Preparations for this visit are being finalised at present. I will also attend the special European Council on employment in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March. In addition, it seems likely that the EU/Africa Summit planned for Cairo in early April will proceed. The final European Council of the Portuguese Presidency will be held on 19 and 20 June. I will also attend EXPO in Hanover on 28 June, the day set aside as Ireland's national day. I have made a number of visits to accession countries and will make further such visits as the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>The details of the strategic focus for the development of this country's interests and image at international level are outlined in my Department's strategy statement. In particular, the business plan for the European and international affairs division contains the goals, outputs and specific actions which are employed to achieve <Col N="6" /> this focus. The programme of international meetings which I have undertaken provides a tangible focus to this strategy. The decision to visit a particular country or meet with its representatives is taken in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the first instance, having considered our bilateral interests. Such interests include political, economic, cultural and development co-operation. The European and international affairs division is responsible for the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>I wrote to European Commission President Prodi on 22 November enclosing a copy of the national development plan. He replied on 3 January wishing the Government success with the implementation of the plan. I have had no contact with the Acting President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin, since his appointment at the end of last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome you back, a Cheann Comhairle, and wish you well for the coming session. Why has the Taoiseach engaged in the farce of answering 15 questions of a diverse nature? Does he agree that makes it well nigh impossible for Opposition Members to pursue their responsibility across the range of issues to which he has given a response? Did the Taoiseach's Department decide to answer these questions together? That is my first question and, since 15 questions were grouped together, I presume I am entitled to put 15 supplementary questions. I will not indulge in the same abuse as the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In light of what the Taoiseach saw in South Africa, is he prepared, in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill and the reallocation of resources in the budget, to increase the Government's allocation of bilateral aid to Lesotho and other countries in Africa or to increase the bilateral and multilateral aid allocation to move it towards the mid-term target of 0.45%? With regard to the 150 business people who attended the function in South Africa addressed by the Taoiseach &ndash; I am not sure whether it was a breakfast or lunch &ndash; will he indicate who selected the 150 people? Will he indicate the representative balance of that group in terms of post-apartheid South Africa?</P>
      <P>With regard to the eligibility of Turkey to apply for membership of the European Union, who will monitor compliance with Copenhagen standards and what role, if any, does the Government have in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the questions put down by Members are the same. In addition, the questions about the Helsinki summit were comprehensively dealt with before Christmas. It is not an inordinate number of questions to be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach's Department make that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>They were dealt with in the <Col N="7" /> normal fashion. I never interfere with the order of the questions. If I were to take the questions one by one&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Topic by topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or even in small groups, we would never get through them. There are almost 100 questions to the Taoiseach on the Order Paper. Today's questions are mainly on development aid projects, the South African trip and the European Council, which we have already discussed, so it is not unreasonable to take them in this manner.</P>
      <P>With regard to the aid programmes, I will not repeat what I said about their value. People have wished for a long time that the Taoiseach would see the aid programmes at first hand and I undertook to do that. I am convinced our development aid budget is well spent and is achieving an excellent return. We are already committed to reaching the UN target for all donors of 0.7%. In addition, we have set an interim target of 0.45% of GNP to be reached in the lifetime of the Government. Deputies will be aware that efforts to make progress in this area have been complicated by the high growth rate of the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>How have they been complicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Growth rates have been between 7% and 8% which makes it much more difficult to reach the target in monetary terms. That is the obvious reason. That said, the interim target has yet to be reached in the lifetime of the Government. It will mean an enormous amount of additional cash resources, but the Government has already stated its support for the aid programme. I mentioned all the valuable benefits it gives. Also, there are growing demands from countries much poorer than South Africa.</P>
      <P>On the visit to South Africa, Enterprise Ireland organised the breakfast in which I was involved. Deputies will be pleased to know the balance of the post-apartheid era was well adhered to. A number of former members of the ANC and business people still in the organisation were involved along with Irish companies. No one would have been unhappy with that. I had no involvement with the companies. They were the responsibility of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>Regarding Turkey, the European Council and the European Commission will monitor the situation to ensure the criteria are met. That will be an ongoing process and it will take a considerable amount of time to see how the various human rights issues and the criteria laid down in Copenhagen and Amsterdam are followed in the time ahead. The European Council will take a special interest as well as the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the trip to South Africa was more concerned with <Col N="8" /> promoting Irish business than improving development aid? Does he agree he should not go on these trips until such time as we have reached the UN target of 0.7%? The amount we donate at present is abysmal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have already seen these programmes at first hand and Members of the House, not to speak of the current and previous Presidents, had previously visited a number of places I visited. Enormous work is being done by the Irish aid programmes but more can be done. I was originally supposed to visit Mozambique where a 21 year old civil war has ended. There is now a huge demand there for aid programmes. Our money is being spent extremely well and on valuable work, not only in monetary terms, but in human terms as evidenced by the Irish missionary groups, by which I was especially impressed. I had read about them but did not realise there were so many. Not only are the missionaries present, but there are also NGOs and Irish people working with groups from other countries. Not all are with APSO, Irish Aid, Concern or other Irish aid organisations. They are putting in a great effort. Many receive support from their families at home and from companies which make charitable donations. The programme is extremely worthwhile and is greatly appreciated. In Lesotho, the entire Cabinet turned up to meet me at the airport for no other reason than to show their gratitude to Ireland for what it has done there for the past 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach embarrassed to any extent in his European Union work by the fact that Ireland, after many warnings, will now be prosecuted by the European Commission for what the <i>Irish Independent</i> has described as potentially catastrophic e-coli pollution of our water supplies? Is it not embarrassing that, with our levels of prosperity and revenue, we should be prosecuted because we ask people, many of them elderly and ill, to drink dirty water?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for acknowledging my question which is an important one. In his discussions with Thabo Mbeke did he raise the issue of the continuing and disastrous war in the Congo in which troops from six states are involved &ndash; Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Namibia and Zimbabwe as well as the Congo? Some of these countries, Zimbabwe in particular which is gradually being converted into a dictatorship, are unable to cater adequately for their people. I understand the South Africans are mediating. What indications did the Taoiseach receive from them as to what is being done to bring to an end this disastrous war which, if it was taking place in Europe, would involve France, Germany, Italy and Spain? It is not just a civil war, it is a major continental war, with the Congo as the battleground. Did it come up in the Taoiseach's discussions and what was the outcome?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct, it is a major war of consequence to the entire continent and it was uppermost in the President's mind. He spoke at length about his involvement. South Africa is increasingly playing a role in the region. It is the President's intention to put an enormous amount of time and effort into bringing wars in the region to an end. The war in the Congo is causing great concern because of the instability being created. During the Christmas period it spread to countries where no difficulties had been experienced for 20 to 30 years. The President did not see an immediate end to the conflict but was anxious to exert his influence. Nelson Mandela is acting on behalf of the South African Government. The Southern Africa development community is co-operating to overcome the difficulties. Its representatives have been talking to those of the United States, Europe and others. South <Col N="10" /> Africa has been playing an active role in the community. Its troops went into Lesotho 18 months ago. It is also playing a role in Mozambique. There have been atrocities and an enormous number of people have died&mdash;</P>

I join with the Taoiseach's deserved expression of praise for the work being done in South Africa and Lesotho with Irish overseas aid and I compliment those involved in the direct delivery of that aid. Does the Taoiseach agree that the level of Irish overseas aid is disgracefully low and will he say when, or indeed if, the Government intends to make any progress towards the United Nation's goal of 0.7% of our GNP going to overseas aid? Will he give a considered response to that? Other Members referred to the detail of increased allocation but I am anxious to hear the Taoiseach giving a specific commitment in this regard.</P>

The aid programme is being distributed through three main channels at present: the direct development partnerships with a number of priority countries such as those which were referred to; multilateral organisations such as the EU, the World Bank and the UN; and NGO programmes and other partner organisations for smaller development projects and emergency assistance. I referred to the NGO aspects previously.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that while the volume of money may have increased, as one would expect in an economy which has been growing at an average annual rate of 7% or 8% over the past five years, the figure has actually decreased this year from 0.35% to 0.31% according to the information I have to hand? Is he further aware that in the review of the parliamentary programme and the programme for Government between his party and the Progressive Democrats, the explicit commitment in the original programme to achieve the interim target of 0.45% has actually been diluted? Can I then conclude that the Government is no longer committed to achieving the interim target of 0.45% in the course of its term of office, whatever about the 0.7%? If the Government is committed to achieving the 0.45% target, will the Finance Bill and the rejigging of the budget which will accompany that, correct the reduction which has come about according to the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the benefit conferred by development aid from countries like Ireland is being destroyed by other European countries who supply the armaments African leaders use to slaughter their enemies, that war is one of the main reasons for underdevelopment in Africa, and that until a political solution is found to some of the conflicts that currently exist in Africa there will continue to be chronic underdevelopment, notwithstanding the aid that this and other governments give to Africa? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussions with President Prodi, has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to express Ireland's disappointment that the Food Authority for Europe is what is contradictorily described as <Col N="13" /> an advisory European food authority? Does the Taoiseach agree this is a contradiction in terms? If it is an authority, it is hardly advisory, and a body which is purely advisory is no use because it means individual countries will be able to use food safety as a means of keeping exports from other European countries out of their markets in a systematic way, as France may be doing at present. Ireland, as the biggest internal exporter of food in Europe, has an overwhelming interest in ensuring there is a single European food authority with authority to override individual member state decisions. Otherwise, our export markets will be closed to us, and that is of grave importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would highlight the point the Deputy has made. The concept is that it will be an authority that will be able to give advice but will also be able to enforce decisions. The House is aware of what has happened between two of the member states in relation to beef. Now they have to take the legal route to try to resolve the problem because the French did not respond to the Commission's request.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made a valid point in his first question. Enormous amounts of resources are being spent in at least six regional conflicts in Africa, some of which have little or no relevance to Europe. These conflicts are stopping economic development and progress and I am not sure how this can be overcome. As Deputy Bruton is aware, there is not a great amount of interest in or assistance given to some of these countries and regional conflicts continue as if nothing is happening. South Africa is probably the exception because of the deep involvement of the US, however, in other areas wars have gone on for years without anything happening.</P>
      <P>However modest, our aid programmes are very significant. In this regard I hope we will play a bigger role over time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the wars referred to by Deputy John Bruton, did the President of South Africa raise with the Taoiseach the possibility of the suspension of all European EDF funding for the participating countries as a form of financial sanction? Did he raise with the Taoiseach the possibility of using fiscal diplomacy in the same manner and with the same degree of effectiveness the IMF was able to bring to bear on Indonesia? Does the Government have a view on the possibility of using those instruments, one in which we have a direct participatory interest and on which we can have an effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, which will start on St. Valentine's Day, what is the Government's position on either a tight or a broad agenda? Is it in favour of dealing with the leftovers of the Amsterdam Treaty negotiations, as the Taoiseach originally advised, or does it support the position of President Prodi that there are additional items that need to be addressed in the context of an <Col N="14" /> Intergovernmental Conference, which is scheduled to conclude at the end of the French presidency this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Clearly there is a lack of medicines, and a lack of appliances and facilities. Some of the centres I have seen were extremely badly equipped and the facilities, even though the staff were doing their best, were far from what we would consider adequate. What was raised with me is the suggestion that the bi-lateral donors should try to get together on an EU basis to co-ordinate our effort. The effort undertaken is much appreciated but there is a feeling among Irish, English, French and German medics that far more could be done if the effort was co-ordinated. An aspect of that could include accessibility of generic drugs. I have already written to President Prodi about some of the aspects raised by these medics. While considering funding and support which is available under the EU budget for the HIV/AIDS prevention and eradication programme, we should try and get greater synergy between the donor organisations and the recipient agencies and perhaps the pharmaceutical companies as well.</P>

Does he agree that there are drugs which can be produced and made available at a minimal cost and which would save the lives of up to 23 million Africans who will otherwise die from AIDS in the next five years? Does the Taoiseach agree that the only reason they are not being made available is because of patent law being enforced by the EU and the USA? Does he agree that a solution must be found to this by providing the WHO with the means of buying out some of these patents and making them available free of charge to manufacturers in Africa who could produce these drugs? It is accepted that drugs companies must be compensated, but surely it is necessary to find a mechanism, such as the WHO providing a fund to buy out patents and compensating companies, so that these lives can be saved. These people cannot be brought back to life five years from now when the patent runs out.</P>

These regulations lay down the same minimum standards for both new local authority and private dwellings, whether rented or owner occupied. Part D of the regulations requires that works shall be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner. The regulations specify performance standards to be achieved, but are not generally prescriptive as to the detailed form of construction, including finishes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that no housing authority worth its salt would build a new housing scheme using eight or nine inch cavity blocks given that most of them stipulate that the method of construction involved should be twin insulated walling? This is the chosen methodology of all housing authorities because it is regarded as providing a much more superior form of insulation. Is the Minister concerned that an inferior form of construction is being adopted wholesale, particularly in the Dublin market where young couples pay more than £160,000 to <Col N="19" /> buy a house which does not comply with the stipulations laid down for public sector housing?</P>

The review of the regulations will be as long as I indicated because it is being done in full consultation with all interested parties &ndash; the construction industry, home builders, consumers and so on &ndash; and it is generally better that a standard should be reached on the basis of agreement. One is more likely to get adherence to it and this system has been in operation for some time. It is a good idea to continue and maintain that procedure to ensure there is full compliance. Apart from the technical guidance documents, a home bond scheme is in operation.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought is available in the housing statistics bulletin for the September quarter 1999, published by my Department and available in the Oireachtas Library. The indices for private new house prices and house building costs measure different factors. The house price index measures changes in private new house prices which reflect the supply and demand for housing. The national house building cost index relates solely to standard wage rates set by the National Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry and average market prices for construction materials and does not include items such as development land prices, planning and development levies, planning fees, legal fees, marketing costs or profits, which are reflected in house prices and any house price index. The Deputy has also chosen to ignore the index for mortgage rates in the bulletin.</P>
      <P>Housing demand has grown phenomenally in recent years due to a number of factors, including strong economic growth, historically low interest rates, increasing employment, rising levels of disposable income, and demographic changes, including high immigration and growth in the key household formation age groups. The Government strategy to moderate house price increases is based, therefore, on increasing the supply of housing. It has implemented a comprehensive range of initiatives to this end and these measures are having an effect. The trend in house price increases is moderating. Record housing output was again achieved in 1999 with new house completions nationally up more than 10% in the first 11 months of 1999 over the same period in 1998. Significantly, in Dublin, where the supply demand imbalance was most critical, the increase in output was running at 16%.</P>

He has told us for the past 12 months that house prices have been levelling off. Is he ashamed to come into the House and admit that average house prices have increased by more than 21% during that period?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy allows me to answer I will give the figures. As I said, they are published and I have used them publicly on at least a dozen occasions. The annual rate of increase in new house prices was 21.6% nationally and 21.9% in Dublin which is well below the peak rates of 27% and 37% respectively in early 1998 prior to the publication of the first Bacon report and the action on house prices taken by the Government. The September quarter cost price indices for new house prices and house building costs stood at 226 and 133 respectively, showing increases over the four quarters of 21.5% and 6.4% respectively. As I said, the house prices and <Col N="22" /> house building indices measure different things. It is not correct to make the assumption, as the Deputy has, that there is a direct link between them. As we know, the items I have mentioned, which were not included, have a major effect on the price of a house in the open market, including profits. The best and only sensible way to deal with the huge demand for housing and the market taking advantage of that by increasing prices is to increase supply. This has been pointed out in every economic report on housing. We will continue to do that and take whatever measures we can to ensure the system facilitates an increase in the output of new housing. Any suggestion the Deputy has to make regarding steps we should take to increase the output will receive every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last November I notified local authorities of their allocations for housing starts for the period 2000-03. I expect that local authorities will commence the construction of, or acquire, in excess of 5,500 houses this year and that the level of house completions, including acquisitions, will be in excess of 4,000 units. All local authorities have been requested to send specific details of their programmes for the year 2000 to my Department by the end of this month and I will then have a clearer indication of the position. Where local authorities did not fulfil their programmes last year I will allow them to carry forward into the current year any uncommenced starts but I will be critically reviewing their capacity to implement increased programmes this year.</P>
      <P>When notifying local authorities of their housing start allocations I indicated to them that the purpose of my introducing a multi-annual local authority housing programme was to enable the authorities to produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over the coming four years and a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery. Previously local authorities had no assurance as to the level of their programme beyond the current year, which led to inefficiency in terms of timing and scale of contracts and forward planning generally. I have also requested local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet higher levels of housing need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> I am very conscious of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given in tackling this need. I expect that total social housing output, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in the existing housing stock and output from the complementary social-voluntary housing measures will meet the housing needs of some 11,000 households in need of social housing this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households.</P>
    <P>My Department will support and co-operate in every way with local authorities to help them achieve their housing programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>

Does the Minister accept that is a woefully inadequate number to meet the existing demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quoted a figure which, as has been explained on a number of occasions, is not correct. One must take account of the way in which local authorities assess the housing needs of those who apply to them. Local authorities have determined that their needs can be met under the social housing programme generally and headings other than a new local authority house. I am not satisfied with the progress of the local authorities, the voluntary housing programmes or the other schemes in the social housing area. I am continuously encouraging, and am taking measures to encourage, greater output from local authorities and the voluntary sector. There are options other than local authority housing that can be availed of by those in need of social housing but sufficient use is not being made of them. I have set a very high target for the voluntary housing sector over the period of the national plan which, I hope, with the help of the special unit we are setting up, can be achieved. It is a challenge. They will provide homes for those who already qualify for local authority houses.</P>

      <P>In the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework 1994-99, it was agreed at the request of the European Commission that a study of road pricing and related issues should be carried out with reference to the Dublin area. This study, which was conducted by a consortium of consultants led by the Oscar Faber Group, was published on 5 October 1999. A copy of the report of the study is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objectives of the study were to consider progress to date in implementing the non-infrastructure measures proposed in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative; to overview the application of economic instruments, in particular those related to road pricing, in the context of other comparable cities; and assess the advantages and disadvantages of using <Col N="25" /> economic and other non-infrastructure policies, in particular road pricing, in the management of traffic in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The study is a preliminary review of the potential for introducing new transport demand management measures in Dublin. The consultants conclude that road pricing could have a role to play in transport policy for Dublin. However, they also consider the issue requires more detailed consideration in the context of an integrated approach to Dublin's transport requirements and that any future pricing initiative is likely to require balancing by a range of other measures.</P>

The DTO discussed road pricing; congestion pricing, which would vary charges according to traffic conditions in an area at a particular time; time-based pricing, the charge for which would be proportional to the time spent travelling within a specified area; and the cordon pricing Deputy Gilmore mentioned, which would involve charges applied at points&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has received a report and has asked the DTO to submit its views by way of another report. Has he put a timeframe on the DTO reporting back to him on the subject of road pricing in Dublin?</P>

It is up to the DTO to feed this into the report it is compiling in relation to the view of the Dublin Transportation <Col N="26" /> Initiative.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has asked the DTO to report again and to consult. Does he have any policy, or even a general view, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, on the principle of road pricing? Would he, as a matter of principle, consider congestion, time or length of journey pricing, or the specific recommendation I mentioned, namely, the introduction of a charge for entering a city centre cordon? Is he ruling out any of those options? It is unfair to ask the DTO to examine this matter in a vacuum without any general Government guidance on it? What is the Minister's general view of this? This is obviously an important matter and could make a major contribution to the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that, in a proper context, it could make a contribution to traffic management in Dublin but, in fairness, it would be wrong of me to refer a report like this to a body such as the DTO, which is responsible for making recommendations and decisions on this matter, and give it a guideline on it beforehand. The DTO is examining the overall picture, including the traffic management measures that need to be taken, the provision of park and ride facilities, improved traffic management and so on. It is examining this matter in its totality; this is merely one element of it. Until the DTO reports to me, it would not be fair for me to indicate one way or the other. In general terms, once I have studied it I will support any report given to me by the DTO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 114 and 571 together.</P>
      <P>The framework for the national car test, which was decided by the previous Government and continued by this Government, involves its operation on a public private partnership and self-financing basis. The NCT is required under EU legislation to provide virtually universal coverage of private vehicles. Accordingly, only minimal exemptions have been granted from its scope.</P>
      <P>The contract for the NCT has been awarded on a competitive basis to ensure a high level of service and value for money to its users. The two-yearly test, which costs £35, will provide a high quality diagnostic service using computerised testing equipment. The re-test fee has been fixed at £19.80 where use of test equipment is necessary; otherwise, re-tests will be carried out free of charge.</P>
      <P>Private motoring costs have not in the past received public subsidies, apart from VAT-VRT reliefs, motor tax and fuel tax afforded for the benefit of persons with disabilities. I do not consider the introduction of the national car test justifies a departure from the well established principle of non-subsidy of private motoring costs and, accordingly, I do not envisage a change in the current arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into account the impact that the introduction of this NCT is having on older people, particularly in rural areas, on those dependent on cars to get around and those on social welfare? Does he agree that many older people may be forced off the road if they cannot meet the cost of repairing their cars? Has the Department carried out any research into the impact this will have on older or poorer people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This car test is at an early stage. It commenced on 4 January and it will be April before the legal aspect will be enforced. Its progress will be examined and the situation will be kept under review. The Government decision was made in October 1996 and there was no question in that decision of subsidising the costs for those on low incomes, social welfare recipients or old age pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 101 and 558 together.</P>
      <P>Some 88,500 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests, an improvement of 13,400 over mid-1999. Of these, approximately 27,000 have been given test appointments and a further 15,000 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. The average longest waiting time nationally is 29 weeks, a reduction of 12 weeks relative to early 1999. Applicants who require a test for urgent reasons, however, are given earlier appointments; about 27% of applicants are tested within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>Average waiting times have not been compiled for each centre due to limitations in the information technology systems involved. The tabular statement in this reply, however, sets out the longest waiting time for each centre. Of the 88,500 applicants, 27,000 are awaiting tests in the Dublin area. The longest waiting times in the Dublin area are 50 weeks in the Finglas-Raheny centre and 48 weeks in the Churchtown-Rathgar-Tallaght centre.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at more than a third above earlier levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. In 1999 a record 154,000 test applications were made to my Department, compared to 118,000 applications in 1887.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements <Col N="31" /> and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to 202,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny.</P>
    <P>I am determined to maintain the momentum of improvement in the driving test service which has now begun and to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times. A maximum waiting time of ten weeks is being targeted by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The current figures which the Minister detailed today are similar to those of <Col N="32" /> 1997-98. We are only reaching that stage, not improving the figures. Is the Minister aware that at the current rate of testing, and in the event of no new provision for the issuance of provisional licences, it will take approximately three years to clear the backlog? If the 45% failure rate is taken into account, it will take four and a half years to clear the backlog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are not satisfactory, I have made that clear. I have worked hard to increase the number of tests substantially. As I explained to the House on a number of occasions, there was great difficulty in securing agreement about improvements through the PCW process. Out of that process, however, came a willingness to operate on an overtime basis and increased productivity was achieved. We recruited 37 new testers, some on contract and some permanent, and I am considering recruiting an additional six testers to reach the ten week target I have set.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to anticipate the number of new applications which will come in. It is tremendous that there is such demand, it reflects what is going on in the economy. It is unsatisfactory, however, that our system has not been able to crank itself up quickly enough to achieve an equilibrium in the number of applications arriving and the number of tests being undertaken.</P>

      <P>I will take some of the credit for the increase in the testing corps from 66 to 101, giving the capacity to hold 202,000 tests in a year. There would be a greater reduction in time on the waiting lists were it not for the huge increase in the number of people &ndash; 154,000 &ndash; who have applied for tests.</P>
      <P>The testers are doing a tremendous job under great strain. They have agreed to work on Saturdays and to work overtime. We have employed a number of new testers and more are being recruited. These have to be trained and more testers must be employed because of the numbers applying for the test.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is responsible for road safety policy. Does he believe it is acceptable that one in every four drivers has only a provisional licence and that some learner drivers have held provisional licences for as long as ten years? Is it acceptable that a learner driver can hold a provisional licence for four years without taking or test or even being questioned on the rules of the road? </P>

      <P>I have responsibility for road safety. I am implementing a comprehensive road safety strategy throughout the country and we are receiving wonderful co-operation from local authority members and officials, health boards, gardaí and the community. My objective is to reduce the 1997 figure for road deaths by 20% before 2002. We are on target to meet that objective although a disaster could occur on our roads at any time. The road using public are adopting a much more responsible attitude and the public bodies which are involved in the promotion of road safety, particularly the National Safety Council, are doing a wonderful job in keeping the safety message before the public.</P>
      <P>I agree that far too many people with provisional licences are driving and that the time people must wait to do the driving test is far too long in some areas. I have given instances of the worst areas. I have also given some indication of the measures taken and which I will continue to take to reduce the waiting period. The situation is not satisfactory and I do not defend it. There is great pressure on the people working in the system and I am grateful to them. More testers must be recruited to cater for the huge increase in the number of test applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin one must now wait up to a year to do a driving test. Is it the Minister's intention to bring that waiting period down to ten weeks by the end of this year? If so, can he estimate the number of driving tests to be carried out in Dublin during the year 2000 and what additional resources will be provided in the Dublin area within that period? Does it not make a nonsense of campaigns to combat drink driving and speeding and to encourage the use of seatbelts to have 85,000 people driving who are not qualified to do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what the figure is in Dublin. I can only say it is not acceptable; it is the worst in the country. It is my intention to recruit more testers, to increase the level of output and to reduce the waiting period in the Dublin driving test centres. I cannot forecast figures because I have no idea how many more applications will be received. I will continue my efforts in conjuntion with the union representing the driving testers. I hope they will agree to allow me to bring back testers who have retired to help us clear the backlog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm the total number of drivers who hold provisional licences and who are currently driving? Can he confirm that this is the only country in the EU where a holder of a provisional licence may drive unaccompanied by a qualified driver?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes up to 12 months to be tested in Dublin. Is the Minister aware that, as a result of this, insurance companies are continuing to charge very high premiums for people who hold provisional licences even though they would pass the test if they had the chance to take it? The problem is not simply one of inconvenience. The cost of motor insurance for young people is also affected. Has the Minister considered involving the private sector in driver testing on a temporary basis in order to clear the backlog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to change the system which allows young drivers and new drivers to drive on a first, second and even third provisional licence without having any form of assessment or is he happy that that system remains in place? Does the Minister have figures for the failure rate of driving test applicants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people driving on provisional licences is 24% of all drivers which is 371,000. The waiting period for the driving test can be reduced in special circumstances, for instance if it is essential for the applicant's job. The waiting time can be reduced to 15 weeks or less in an emergency. The only way to deal with this problem fairly is to reduce the average waiting time for all areas and this will help to reduce insurance costs.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to introduce a theory test this year. It will be necessary to pass this test before a provisional licence is issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been held up slightly because it has been decided to use the public private partnership method in order not to get bogged down in the future as has happened with driving tests. Consultants are drawing up the requirements and proposals will be invited for the operation of the new theory test. I hope this will be introduced before the end of this year.</P>

      <Quest>the situation in relation to the fatality and injury caused by premises collapsing at Washington Street, Cork; the situation in relation to the demolition of premises at this location; the steps, if any, being taken to avoid a repetition of these occurrences; and if local authorities have adequate powers, resources and personnel to deal with these situations.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 December last the parapets of Nos. 33 and 34 Washington Street Cork collapsed resulting in the death of one person and serious injury to another. This was a tragic accident and I am sure Deputies on all sides would wish me to convey our condolences to the victims and their families.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the maintenance of private property is a matter for the owners of such property. However, where dangerous structures are concerned, local authorities have extensive powers under the 1964 Sanitary Services Act. Under this Act a local authority may serve notice on owners of buildings requiring them to carry out specified works to prevent the building from becoming dangerous. They can also enter property and carry out work on a dangerous structure where there is an immediate danger to public safety, and recover the costs involved. Local authorities also have powers to inspect buildings to obtain any information for any purpose of the Act.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 national building regulations set out the minimum legal requirements in relation to the design and construction of new buildings and the extension to, material alteration of and changes of use of existing buildings. Otherwise, the regulations do not apply to buildings built before this date. Part A of the First Schedule to the regulations sets out requirements in relation to the structural stability of buildings.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with Cork Corporation. In response, the corporation informed my Department that it engaged consultants to advise it generally on the incident and its implications. Specifically, it requested the consultants to investigate and report on the possible causes of the failure of the parapets and to assess reports, commissioned by owners from their engineering advisers, in relation to the safety of other buildings in the locality. Cork Corporation also used its powers under the 1964 Act, including service of notices requiring buildings to be vacated and works to be carried out, including demolition of certain buildings or parts of buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that adequate resources are available to local authorities, through outsourcing or otherwise, to deal effectively and efficiently with the problems which dangerous buildings can present. The powers available to local authorities to take action in relation to dangerous buildings, which I outlined earlier, are extensive and I am not aware that any changes to the statutory position are necessary. In particular, it is important that nothing should be done that would obscure where the primary responsibility for safety of buildings lies, which is with the building owners. In conclusion, while the powers available to local authorities appear to be satisfactory, I propose to review the position generally when the report <Col N="36" /> commissioned by the local authority is available and in the light of any views which Cork Corporation might have.</P>

      <P>My heart goes out to the relatives of the young woman who was fatally injured in this accident. I also extend my sympathies to those who were injured. Let us also not forget those who are suffering continuing loss due to the closure of part of one of Cork's major streets.</P>
      <P>I do not point the finger of blame at anybody. Is the Minister satisfied that Cork Corporation has sufficient resources and assistance? Has there been a request or is the Minister able to make further help available, by way of personnel or otherwise, to Cork Corporation? I wish to raise the general situation throughout the country but I will come back to that. How long will the current situation last in Cork? Is the corporation adequately resourced to deal with the problem it is confronting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that Cork Corporation has the resources to do what is necessary. This issue is covered by the legislation so the corporation can take action under the Act. It can carry out work on a dangerous structure where there is an immediate danger to public safety and it can recover the cost thereof. It also has building inspectors and so forth.</P>
      <P>Part of the street has been closed for some time but it is hoped to reopen it by next weekend. The corporation took action on a number of matters although I am not sure I should mention them. Perhaps I could give the Deputy the information off the record. He will be aware that dangerous structure notices were served on a number of houses on Washington Street to require demolition to first floor level. Notices were served on other houses to require demolition to ground floor level. In a number of other buildings the corporation served notices to vacate in the days following the accident but remedial works were immediately undertaken by the owners to render them safe. That is the up-to-date position.</P>

      <P>There is another important aspect to this matter. The Minister referred to the 1964 Act and what can be done under its provisions. However, nobody knew this building was dangerous. Can we learn a lesson from this awful tragedy? Can the Minister think of a procedure whereby local authorities could improve the situation by anticipating these occurrences? Could they be given power to enter buildings where such occurrences might take place? They have powers to deal with dangerous buildings, but what about potentially dangerous buildings? Can anything be done from a legislative point of view or otherwise to prevent such occurrences again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The building control sections of each local authority are charged with responsibility for checking out complaints about buildings. Will the Minister ask each local authority the total number of staff within each building control section? My information is that there is a deficiency in terms of the number of people within each local authority section who can carry out these inspections to ensure quality is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the detailed information the Deputy requested about each local authority. Over the past two and a half years, however, we have ensured that local authorities have building control officers &ndash; many of them did not have such officers before then. It is also important to point out that this task does not have to be carried out directly by a local authority officer. It can be carried out, as in the case of Cork Corporation, by engaging consultants or outside bodies. I suggest it takes that route.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked the pertinent question of what might be done in light of the tragedy. That is currently subject to a review. The experience we gain from the tragedy in Cork will form part of that review. A number of suggestions have been made, one of which was the compulsory inspection of buildings. If they do not comply, they will not get a certificate&mdash;</P>

      <P>Something like that. The difficulty is that if such a policy were implemented, many buildings would be left uninsured and the victims of accidents such as the one we have been discussing would not be able to claim compensation. That is one problem. It is not easy to give the Deputy an answer that would satisfy people who have suffered as a result of this. Perhaps an increase in the monitoring of such buildings on a more regular basis and ensuring that older buildings are monitored on a regular basis might be one of the recommendations to emerge.</P>

As the medical practitioners Bill will not be published until the end of this year, will the Taoiseach consider introducing legislation to protect female patients, in this instance, who may be at risk of losing their lives if they cannot access treatment quickly and who, at the moment, do not have any statutory protection?

It is a matter of urgency that we would know when the Bill will come before the House in order that people could be removed from the vocational education committees to make room for the new representatives. Were the housing Gaeltacht (amendment) Bill to have an Irish title, it would probably be Bille um thithíocht Gaeltacht (leasú). It would give legislative effect to changes in the housing grants administered by the Department under the Gaeltacht Acts, 1929-79. This Bill has been promised since a court case in 1997.

    <P>I note we have by-passed amendment No. 1. I regret that. I appreciate that it is ruled out of order because it could involve a charge on the Revenue. However, it is very difficult to work out how one can have full and comprehensive advocacy services without legal representation. I and my colleague in the Labour Party are of the view that we should not exclude the possibility of legal representation. It is an issue to which we will have to return, particularly as the Legal Aid Board is under-resourced and is unable to provide the full legal representation that is necessary.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 2 deals with gender balance. For a long time we have been paying lip service to the notion of gender equality. Some progress has been made. However, it is time to bring this a stage further by enshrining it in Acts of Parliament. That is why I moved this amendment on Committee Stage. The Bill as it stands provides that in respect of membership of the board the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each gender is represented. There is an obligation on the Minister to ensure an appropriate gender balance. However, that is &ldquo;as determined by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;. The problem is that that leaves it at the Minister's discretion. It is possible to have as the Minister, a typical MCP who is totally unsympathetic to the notion of appropriate gender balance. I am not for a moment suggesting that the present Minister, whether he remains in that office or not, qualifies as an MCP. However, we could find that the current Minister will be over in Iveagh House tomorrow as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and who knows who would be in this ministry. I am not expecting that &ndash; I think I see the future Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, leaving the House. He was just keeping in touch with what is happening here. Essentially, it is not a matter that should be left to the discretion of a Minister. That is my main point. We argued that very strenuously on Committee Stage. We made the point that the time has arrived when we should enshrine in statute what is an appropriate gender balance. It is on that basis that I moved this amendment on Committee Stage seeking to have &ldquo;appropriate gender balance&rdquo; defined and interpreted as meaning as close as possible to a minimum of 40% men and 40% women. My colleague in the Labour Party has an amendment to section 9 along the same lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reaction on Committee Stage was to listen and to promise to take our views into account. For that reason I am glad that he has put down his own amendment on Report Stage which will involve a statutory requirement on the Minister to have regard to the objective that there be no fewer than eight members who are women and no fewer than eight members who <Col N="51" /> are men. The present interim board conforms to that standard. It has 20 members, and there are 12 men and eight women. It also conforms to the 40% rule which Deputy Broughan and I are trying to have accepted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can convince us that his way of dealing with this is better from a drafting point of view, I am prepared to take the appropriate action in relation to my proposal. It seems that the substance of the Minister's new amendment takes on board our 40% proposal. Subject to what the Minister has to say, we may be able to dispose of it on that basis. When the Minister has moved his amendment, we can make a decision as to how we might deal with the logistics.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I was very unhappy to receive the Chair's admonition that the first amendment had been ruled out of order because it could result in a charge on the Revenue. Deputy O'Keeffe and I made a strong case in favour of full advocacy, including legal representation. I accept the ruling of the House. There are many circumstances where it is unclear whether somebody should have legal representation. I particularly have in mind employment appeal tribunals and such bodies. A person might be accompanied by a workmate or a skilled trade union official. However, many workers and constituents feel there should be a legal aspect to it. The same applies to NSSB and the new Comhairle organisation. An element of advocacy brings in a legal aspect. I regret, therefore, that we are not prepared to consider this at this stage. I hope we can return to it at some future time when Comhairle is up and running.</P>
      <P> The extent of the lacuna in the area of legal representation, including the waiting lists for civil legal aid, is indicative of the needs of our constituents. We should examine this aspect as Comhairle develops. For example, some serious cases may merit the attention of a senior barrister at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is still in office and I hope he will be in a position to take Question Time tomorrow. I commend him on going some way to meet us on the question of adequate gender representation. Political parties are often asked why they do not practice what they preach. The gender imbalance in the House is a serious cause for concern. My party has for a long time implemented a gender balance policy, at least in terms of a 40% threshold for candidate selection. All areas of civil society, including political parties, should pursue this objective. My predecessor, the former Minister for Education, was instrumental in the introduction of the 40% rule by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe provides that an appropriate gender balance should mean &ldquo;as close as possible to a minimum of 40 per cent. men and 40 per cent. women&rdquo;, while amendment No. 16 in the name <Col N="52" /> of the Minister provides that the Minister &ldquo;shall have regard to the objective of there being not less than 8 members who are women and not less than 8 members who are men.&rdquo;. Given the five members to be nominated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the possible make-up of the members of the new board, the Minister will doubtless say an absolute rule would make his task very difficult. Despite this, we should adhere to the objective of gender equality, especially in this organisation. That is why amendment No. 17 in my name provides that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, &ldquo;shall ensure that at least 40 per cent. of members of the Board are men and at least 40 per cent. of members of the Board are women.&rdquo;. I intend to press this amendment because the establishment of a national organisation, such as Comhairle, will play an important representative role and in view of this its membership should reflect gender equality.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for tabling amendments and for acknowledging that we considered this issue between Committee and Report Stages and have introduced an amendment which meets the concerns expressed on Committee Stage. My amendment proposes that on making appointments I or any future Minister would have regard to the objective of having a minimum of eight women and eight men on the board.</P>
      <P>When I appointed the original board of 20 members there were 11 men and 9 women, which represented a gender balance of 55% and 45%, respectively. The changes to the membership since then reflect circumstances beyond anybody's control. There is a requirement to appoint five members to the board who represent people with disabilities. This quota has been exceeded by one, if not two. There is a need, therefore, to consider factors other than gender, such as disability, other persons and, given that Comhairle's offices and premises are spread around the country, geographical location.</P>

I see the practical difficulties involved in dealing with two Departments and the disability issue. I accept that a male disabled person, who may be an excellent member of the board, would have to be excluded if the provision was too strict. Given this, I accept the Minister's amendment. It complies with the spirit of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage by my party and the Labour Party.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to consider the establishment and maintenance of a nationwide network of accessible offices providing all necessary and relevant independent information, advise and advocacy for individuals with disabilities,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with the functions of the board, which is the core of the Bill. The purpose of the amendment is to provide for as broad a range of functions as possible for the board. On a technical point, my amendment and that of my colleague is drafted for inclusion in the Bill. We use the phrase &ldquo;to consider the establishment&rdquo;, to avoid being knocked out on technical grounds or being out of order. The second minor technical point is that the word &ldquo;advise&rdquo; in my amendment is incorrect. Whether that was caused by my bad handwriting in writing the amendment, it should be &ldquo;advice&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;advise&rdquo;, the noun rather than the verb. That can be tidied up if the Minister is prepared to go along with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must return to the main and essential purpose of the Bill. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, from which the establishment of Comhairle arises, is designed to empower and enable people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights. How best can that be done? What sort of function should be provided for the board to enable that to happen? I will focus on two aspects of my amendment. One is the need to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a nationwide network. It is important that the services of Comhairle would be just as available in Ballydehob as in Ballyfermot. I emphasise the need to have a nationwide network. I accept that every effort will be made, but a requirement to have a nationwide network should be included in the Bill setting up the body. I accept that the new body <Col N="54" /> will use the citizen's information centres of the NSSB and the premises of the NRB around the country, but should we provide the actual requirement for the nationwide network in the Bill? </P>
    <P>The second important issue and the second important word in the amendment relates to the requirement in the Bill that this network of offices should be &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;. In practical terms subject to finance etc. every effort will be made to make these offices accessible, but bearing in mind that we are talking about people with disability, we must put a higher priority on the requirement to make all these offices accessible. We should provide for that in the Bill. The accessibility arises from the point of view that these offices should be accessible to mobility impaired persons. Apart from what is in the Bill, I hope it will be a priority to ensure that if there is not full accessibility to these premises at this stage, this matter will be remedied without delay. I emphasise the need for a nationwide network and for the offices to be fully accessible.</P>
    <P>The third part of my amendment deals with the need to give independent information, advice and advocacy. We did not have the opportunity to go into the question of advocacy because of the difficulty about the motion relating to independent legal representation. The Minister, like myself, is a solicitor. How can he tell the House with a straight face that one can have advocacy and at the same time preclude legal representation? Relating to the problems of tribunals and so on, it boils down to the fact that legal representation would be absolutely necessary to ensure that the rights of the individual, disabled or otherwise, will be upheld. One needs advocacy before a tribunal and if we are specifically precluding that, how does the Minister think that we can provide the full range of advocacy? I am sorry that it is precluded particularly because of the practical problem in relation to the legal aid board and its offices, without pointing the finger at those involved in the provision of legal aid. They are absolutely overworked and under-resourced and there is not enough personnel. It could mean that somebody who received the information and advice from one of the Comhairle offices would not then be able to fully prosecute his entitlements because he would not have the advocacy available which in some instances can only be provided by legal representation. That is the third aspect to that proposal. Those are the main reasons I tabled that amendment and I ask the Minister to consider the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The key reason on Committee Stage that the Labour Party put forward an amendment, which is very close to the amendment moved by Deputy O'Keeffe, was that we were concerned that in the sectional functions in section 7, we did not use that phrase &ldquo;accessible network&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;nationwide&rdquo;, both of which are key elements which should be clearly spelt out in the legislation. Accessibility continues <Col N="55" /> to be a problem. In the discussion period leading up to the publication of the Bill by the Minister, and for a number of months afterwards, I received many letters, representations, and submissions from constituents and others in Dublin city, and from the Forum for People with Disabilities, complaining about the problems of accessibility in employment exchanges, in some existing NSSB supported offices and particularly in the transport network. This is a fundamental issue and raises a question which is the essence of this amendment. To what extent can the Minister show he is providing the necessary support for people with disability through this new organisation? This is the real fear. Deputy O'Keeffe said that the network we have should be widely available from west Cork to west Donegal and from Louth to Wexford and across the country. When we were researching this around the time of the publication of the Bill, there seemed to be great uncertainty about the existing NRB premises, of which there are about 18. At that time, about three or four months ago, it was expected that Comhairle might have eight or nine. Obviously there would be many more offices around the country, such as the groups of unemployed and the resource centres, with which many Deputies such as myself and the Ceann Comhairle would be involved, which would participate in this network and utilise publications of Comhairle. Why do we not specify in the legislation that this will be a nation-wide network and that it certainly will be accessible?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment includes some of the aspects I raised in separate amendments and he broadened the discussion from one about accessibility to the fears which staff in NRB had in relation to the levels of support the new organisation will provide for their clientele. I am a director of the Northside Partnership and the detailed monthly reports of unemployment levels recorded at local exchanges show the huge level of unemployed who have a disability &ndash; half of the unemployed in the constituencies of Dublin North-East and Dublin North Central have a disability of one kind or another. We on this side of the House worry about the extent to which the new organisation will be able to offer these people a personalised and supportive service.</P>
      <P>I note that in discussions SIPTU, for example, raised at length the problems it foresaw with the planned merger of NSSB and NRB, particularly in relation to the availability of information, support services and assisting technology to those with disabilities. I am sure the Minister received the submission from SIPTU which raised deep concerns. It stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear whether Comhairle will have anything to offer our current customers [that is, NRB customers], apart from an information service. It follows that it is equally unclear whether the experience and expertise of NRB staff will have a substantial place in the organisation. These concerns could make Comhairle <Col N="56" /> an unattractive career option for current NRB staff.</P>
    <P>The key concern is the clientele of the NRB and whether the gaps in provision and the additional resources the staff feel are necessary to fill those gaps will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>This side of the House has concentrated on the word &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo;, a word not included by the Minister. The functions of the board are set out in section 7(1)(b) which states &ldquo;. to assist and support individuals, in particular those with disabilities, in identifying and understanding their needs and options and in accessing their entitlements to social services&rdquo;. It does not say whether the Minister, the staff of his Department and the new organisation will continue to give the very detailed mentoring and one-to-one customer orientated service to those with disabilities. Neither does it say whether those with disabilities, who very often have much to contribute to our society and economy, will remain part of the monthly unemployment statistics and be unsupported in entering the work force</P>
    <P>In framing the amendments we had to use the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; because of financial implications, but I ask the Minister to look again at this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Much depends on what is meant by the term &ldquo;nationwide&rdquo;. For example, we promised we would make the mediation service nationwide. When we came into office two and a half years ago there were only two mediation offices in the country while currently there are ten. I would like to think this service is as nationwide as it is possible for such a service to be. Obviously we cannot have an office in every town and village.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, there are about 85 CICs &ndash; Citizen Information Centres &ndash; throughout the country, 35 of which are regarded as key offices while the other 50 are made up of smaller, part-time offices and mobile centres. The majority of the 35 key offices are physically accessible. The view of the old and the new boards is that as many as possible of these should be physically accessible.</P>
      <P>I cannot remember the exact funding which was available to the NSSB when I took office, but my recollection is that funding has increased by almost 100% since I became Minister. Therefore, to a certain extent there has been a huge investment in the NSSB over the past two years. The recent budget provided for an increase in the region of £750,000 with a view to ensuring the board and its staff would have the resources to progress the programme of greater accessibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7(1)(a) refers to accessibility and the need to ensure that individuals have access to proper information. Accessibility takes a number of forms other than physical accessibility and includes accessibility to modern technology, particularly the Internet, and all the other telecommunications services which are available, which are probably much more important to <Col N="57" /> people with disabilities than to those who have no disability.</P>
    <P>Section 7(1)(c) says a function of the board is &ldquo;to promote greater accessibility . of social services and of information&rdquo;. I do not agree, therefore, with Deputies who say the Bill does not provide for greater accessibility or that we are not conscious of the need for it. I cannot accept their amendments which, the Deputies have admitted, were drafted in such a way as to allow them to be discussed on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Implicitly and explicitly the Bill sets out as a function of the board that all information, advice and advocacy is accessible to all people, not only those with a disability. I undertake to ensure that physical accessibility to the board's premises forms part of any strategic plan brought forward by the board, in addition to accessibility to the various aids in terms of technology, etc. However, I do not think such an undertaking is necessary given the requirement that five members of the board are to represent people with disability. To the best of my knowledge seven of the 20 members represent people with disability, and I have no doubt that these people will have this issue as a key objective in any plans which are brought forward. In this context I ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendments and I guarantee this will form a key objective in the strategic plan.</P>

      <P>I believe that the agricultural community likes the Minister, Deputy Walsh, as a person, but at the same time has no confidence in him as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It likes him because he is likeable but has no confidence in him as Minister because he has failed to provide a real lead for the community in the face of the grave challenges it faces. The farmers' confrontation with the meat factories should never have happened. It should have been foreseen by the Minister. Instead he took the step that sparked it off through his decision to increase veterinary fees. That would never have happened when Deputy Yates was Minister.</P>
      <P>The reason for the low price for Irish beef was summed up well in a newspaper article on 24 January written by the Brussels correspondent of one of our major newspapers. The correspondent explained why British beef had begun to displace Irish beef on the shelves of an Irish owned butchers shop in Brussels. He put it down to what he described as &ldquo;Ireland's failure consistently to produce the very highest quality, to account for local tastes&rdquo; in Belgium. He said of the Irish butcher in Belgium: &ldquo;Daily, he weeds out meat cuts from Irish boxes unacceptable to his customers' tastes.&rdquo;  This Irish butcher wants to buy Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The Irish beef is not in uniform cuts to meet customers' needs. It is presented poorly and too often it comes from cattle that have not been bred for beef quality characteristics. As a result of poor marketing, presentation and breeding, Irish farmers get a deplorable price for their beef &ndash; one that is only a fraction of that paid to beef producers on the continent. The Minister has done little or nothing about this in his two and a half years in office. He has allowed beef processing to be concentrated in the hands of a few traders, who are interested in short-term margins, not long-term consumer market development.</P>
      <P>The Food Industry Development Group told the Minister two years ago that our processing industry suffers from &ldquo;over reliance on commodity-type produce&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the limited scale of many enterprises inhibits cost competitiveness&rdquo;. Forfás has predicted a dramatic fall in the number of people employed full time in farming over the next 15 years. The Minister is making no attempt to manage the changes that will occur. He is not doing anything to ensure that farming survives. He does not want to offend anyone and, therefore, does nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers and food processors represent Ireland's oldest and perhaps proudest community. They deserve honest leadership, a leadership that seeks to master the forces of change rather than just ignore them and focus exclusively on crisis management. The agricultural com<Col N="59" /> munity does not get such leadership at ministerial level. Farmers and agricultural interests deserve better than they are getting, but I do not believe they will get it from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has passed his sell-by date. He has been in Agriculture House for too long, is too dependent on civil servants, does not possess the flair, capability or understanding necessary to keep pace with a fast changing industry and does not have the moral authority which befits the position of Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in a country such as Ireland where agriculture is a very important industry. The Minister has had several opportunities to expound on his vision for Irish agriculture in this new century, but there is only a stumble from one crisis to another.</P>
      <P>Under the stewardship of the Minister there have been dramatic falls in farm incomes. More than 4,000 families leave the land each year, our agricultural colleges are only half full and many young people will not even think about taking over the family farm. Worse still, there is an utter air of despondency. There are outside influences for which no Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development could be held responsible, such as the BSE crisis in 1996. However, the hands-on approach adopted by the former Minister, Deputy Yates, during that crisis demonstrates how pedestrian the Minister is.</P>
      <P>The issues that come under the Minister's remit and are under his control are those on which he will be judged harshly. The events of the past two weeks serve to highlight his remarkable lack of understanding of just how bad farm incomes are. Two weeks ago he saw nothing wrong with increasing inspection fees from £3.80 to £5.50 for each animal killed at meat processing plants. He evidently believed that farmers should pay a greater share of the inspection fees, yet he watched helplessly last autumn as approximately one million cattle were sold at prices averaging between 80p and 82p per pound to meat factories even though they were worth more.</P>
      <P>Farmers were shell shocked after the fodder crisis of the previous year and they killed off cattle that usually would have been kept until early spring 2000. The factories knew what was happening and did what they know best, kept a lid on the price. They knew that there would be queues every Monday morning and that they were in for a large cattle kill. They also did what they have been good at down the years, they worked in concert with each other and there was not more than 2p per pound between any quotation throughout the autumn. However, the factories did not pass back the legitimate market value to the producers, which subsequently brought about their downfall. They lined their pockets at the expense of beef producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef producers and particularly winter finishers, half of whom went out of business over <Col N="60" /> the past five years, were very angry and uneasy throughout the autumn. However, just after Christmas when all the indicators at home and abroad pointed to an inevitable price increase for beef, the processors took their soundings and judged that there were plenty of cattle around, at least for the first half of January. The cartel arrangement went into overdrive again. There was no increase in prices in the new year and beef producers just could not take anymore. A blockade of the factories began and the issue of the rise in meat inspection charges quickly spread to that of poor prices.</P>
    <P>The great explosion of farmer solidarity, aided in no small way by a wave of public sympathy, helped farmers to pressurise the factories into paying 8p per pound more for cattle in most cases. The Minister must have been dumbfounded by events taking place around him. A week before he wanted to saddle farmers with an extra £1.80 per animal, yet the following week he saw farmers negotiate the inspection levy out of existence in its current form and obtain £50 more for each animal. He and his Department were able to secure a better refund system of payment for meat processors, which amounts to between 1p and 2p per pound, with greater efficiency. What does this say about the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? If he had been on top of his brief he would have known that the increase in inspection levies was morally wrong. Farmers were being robbed by the day. The Minister was unaware of efficiencies in his Department which could have been made. Had a more alert Minister been in charge there would not have been a blockade, farmers need not have done something they do not like doing, workers would not have lost pay, markets would not have been put in jeopardy and the sour taste left between the farmers and meat processors would be less intense. In other words, the Minister made a hames of the whole affair.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes in the culture that farmers will pay whatever levies are deemed necessary. He believed they would soak up the levies and pay the piper. This is the central weakness of the Minister and this Administration. By placing levies on cattle, financial penalties are transferred onto the primary producer who is not in a position to take them. In this instance the Minister sided with the meat factories. He has never laid a hand on the meat processors and why would he? He is so long around Agriculture House that he was on the platform in 1988 with half the Fianna Fáil Cabinet and Larry Goodman to announce the details of the so-called greatest ever meat processing project. Most farmers believe the Minister would be slow to take on the meat processors.</P>
    <P>However, last week changed everything. There is now a new self-esteem and pride in farmers of which any Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should take note. The Minister's incompetence was highlighted long before last week. During the Agenda 2000 negotiations <Col N="61" /> the Minister claimed a wonderful victory for farmers but many serious defects have emerged. It can be argued that based on the original EU proposal Irish and other EU farmers are better off financially than at first thought. However, what seems to have been missed by most commentators is that if the intervention which is paid at a lowly 55p ever comes into being over the next six years, the so-called financial gains of the cheque in the post will be beyond recognition. That is why the farmer blockade holds out greater hope for the industry as far as the processors are concerned. As a meat exporting nation, if we are not able to get a premium price for our product on premium markets, Agenda 2000 will unravel around us.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not care about the fate of the 42,000 sheep farmers that night in Brussels. He turned his back on them. He did not put the sheep industry into second or third division but into no division. His inept handling of the matter turned sheep farmers into second class citizens. Irish farmers must take the horrible decision to reduce the number of sheep on their farms as a result of the way in which extensification payments have been organised. As we speak, thousands of farmers who have substantial ewe flocks on mixed farms must make the heartbreaking decision whether to keep their sheep and do without extensification payments or maximise their financial intake and get rid of the sheep.</P>
    <P>This Minister did not do anything over the years to help the sheep industry. I believe he has something against it. He had an ideal opportunity to level the playing pitch as far as sheep farmers were concerned. I put on record that from April to November lambs were far cheaper than they were in the previous 12 month period. It must be remembered that is when most of the lambs are sold. The unfairness of the system can be seen by virtue of the fact that a farmer in France received £1.30 per pound for lamb last year when our farmers were taking as little as 83p and 84p. Today farmers in both countries get the same ewe premium despite the fact that it was meant to reflect the price of lamb on the continental market. Obviously Ireland has been left behind.</P>
    <P>The EU extensification payments agreed by the Minister do not extend to sheep. Sheep numbers will be calculated but farmers still will not be paid. As far as the EU is concerned, there is a stabiliser in effect suppressing prices on ewe premium which now stands at 7%. The announcement yesterday that the 1999 total ewe premium will be pegged at £17.7 per ewe brings further bad news for sheep farmers. I put it to the Minister on behalf of the sheep farmers that if sheep cannot be counted for extensification payments they should be taken out of it altogether. That is what farmers want.</P>
    <P>The Government must be serious about the sheep industry before the backs of farmers are broken. Sheepmeat is one of the few commodities that is not in surplus in Europe. As a result of the way the Minister handled the matter the next big <Col N="62" /> farmer protest will centre on sheep. The Minister knows what I am talking about. Farmers believe he let them down last summer. I wish to address this matter to the four Independent Deputies who prop up this minority Government, Deputies Gildea, Blaney, Fox and Healy-Rae. They represent the four constituencies with the biggest sheep numbers. When they vote on this motion they can show the farmers in their areas where their interests lie.</P>

      <P>I am sure they are but this will be an ideal opportunity for them to show that they vote differently from what they say locally. Under the Minister's leadership the pig industry has gone from bad to worse. Pig farmers are disillusioned. The new package the Minister is bringing in is of no use to 80% of them.</P>
      <P>One matter the Minister handled very badly is the so-called infringement by farmers of various matters relating to the payment of premia. I fully accept that there must be checks and balances and that the EU auditors must be satisfied. That is correct. I am not making a case for anyone who defrauds the Department. However, I have a problem with the disproportionate fines meted out to people for very small infringements. I know several farmers whose premium was withheld for a year or two at a cost of £3,000 to £4,000 per year. They had no disposable income as a result. A new bureaucratic industry has grown up around the premia. There must be an independent appeals tribunal located outside Dublin. If the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs can decentralise and have offices in local areas, why can the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not establish such a tribunal in a rural area?</P>
      <P>There is a great future for the beef industry if we handle it correctly. There must be competition between the live exporters and the processors. The industry has been going backwards during the Minister's time in office. I reluctantly say that if we are to make progress the Minister must stand aside. I hope by this time tomorrow the Taoiseach will have assigned him a different Department. I know he has a lot to offer but, unfortunately, it is not in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this timely debate and thank Fine Gael for sharing time with me. I will not visit all the ills of the farming community on the Minister. That would be churlish and show a lack of understanding of the farming crisis. I heralded the problems of the beef industry in this House on numerous occasions. Many people thought I spoke about them just because I was from the midlands, where beef farmers were suffering a particular onslaught, but I often heralded some of the problems we are now facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by the mission statement from the <Col N="63" /> beef industry, which the task force agreed for the beef sector. It stated:</P>
    <P>Radical and fundamental action is required by all parties involved in and responsible for the beef sector in Ireland in order to equip the industry to move forward into the 21st century. The future development of the beef industry will be based on a partnership between the various participants involved, in particular, producers, processors and industry employees, working together to (i) maximise the contribution of the industry to the economy; (ii) ensure improved returns at all levels in the sector and an equitable distribution of these returns; and (iii) provide sustainable employment in the sector. The emphasis will be on a market-led approach through the development of high value markets within the EU, meeting the needs of the consumer and more effective selling on international markets.</P>
    <P>The past week or so has thrown the beef industry into crisis. Those who are very familiar with the beef sector are well aware that this crisis has been bubbling under the surface for a long time. Minister, the catalyst for the chaos we witnessed over the past few weeks came directly from your office. A ham-fisted attempt &ndash; that is being mild &ndash; was made to impose an increase in the veterinary inspection levy. That was the spark that ignited this beef dispute but the problem was smouldering underneath. It was like dropping a lit match on a volatile substance.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports the motion. I do not often come into the House to call on a Minister to resign &ndash; some of that can be a bit churlish &ndash; but partnership was a fundamental part of the mission statement for the beef industry and on its very first test, you failed to implement that part of the commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>After this evening, I do not know who to address to get anything done in this House. The Minister fell at the very first hurdle. The essence of partnership was neglected by the Minister. He unilaterally imposed the levy without consulting the farmers. In 1996 I spoke about the people who were denying farmers a fair return for their product. I claim to be the catalyst behind the effort of the then Minister, Deputy Yates, to refer to the Competition Authority the alleged anti-competitive practices by the alleged cartel operating in the beef industry. The Minister allowed them the opportunity to unilaterally pass on the increase in the inspection levy to the weakest section of the tripod &ndash; the farming community. When the Minister decided to go for full cost recovery, there was not a factory in the country that was not prepared to recover it <i>in toto</i>. In itself, that act by the factories must give some<Col N="64" /> body food for thought and indicate that some sort of cartel was at work. Surely one or two factories are more efficient than others, with different cost base structures. Surely some of the workers are paid more than others, although they are not overpaid. Even the fixed cost element should vary in some form but by definition the variable cost element must vary, yet we found that, by some strange coincidence, there was uniformity in movement in the upward, but more than likely in the downward, direction by all the factories. I cannot say whether a cartel is operating but when we referred this matter to the Competition Authority in 1997, the Competition Authority had an onus to thoroughly investigate it. It had the statutory authority to do so.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, at the first meeting of the beef task force, the Minister stated that there was a compelling need to put the industry on a sound footing for once and for all, and to avoid lurching from crisis to crisis. Those are fine sentiments with which I agree, but if the Minister's track record reflected a real commitment to this policy, we could have avoided the chaos that befell the beef industry in the past month. Unfortunately, that was not so.</P>
      <P>The Minister precipitated this dispute through the manner in which he imposed the veterinary increase, and attempted to wash his hands of its method of implementation. This critical error resulted in the dispute being thrashed out in the courts over a number of days, and only when the entire beef sector was paralysed did the Minister take action to facilitate a resolution to the dispute. This has been an awful chapter in the Minister's tenure in the Department. He bears a significant responsibility for the hardship and anger that flowed from the dispute and it is for this reason the Labour Party supports the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>We must move on, however, because demanding parliamentary accountability for the beef dispute is only one of the challenges facing us in this House. Important as this task is, there is an onus on all of us in the House to face the fallout from the dispute fairly and squarely. Over the past few weeks thousands of workers were laid off. The sense of injustice within the farming community about a practice which exists between beef processors has been laid bare. These are the issues that need to be urgently addressed, and I hope the debate this evening will prove a starting point.</P>
      <P>There are public policy goals in relation to agriculture which we must adopt, and we must adopt long-term views in these areas. We must aim to create a competitive industry which can meet the demands of a liberalised market. We must support targeted structural and social policies which address rural depopulation and poverty, and we must take steps to ensure the protection of the environment and the provision of a safe, quality food supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three aspects to the crisis in the beef sector and I will address them briefly. The first is <Col N="65" /> the behaviour of the beef processors towards the farmers, and the allegations of a cartel and anti-competitive practices. The second is the continuing fall in farm incomes across the board and the third is the future of the farm family, and we must never lose sight of that. There is an up side to every dispute and one of the up sides for farmers, apart from getting the 5p to 7p per pound increase, which represents about £40 to £50 per bullock going through the factory &ndash; that is important from an income viewpoint &ndash; is that there is now a better understanding among the general public of the odds that are stacked against farmers. That is a positive aspect. The non-farming community now knows the price farmers are paid per pound for their beef. They are also aware of the price per pound they pay for beef in the supermarkets and they are asking who is creaming off the profits. It is not the farmers, yet the consumers are paying the price. I hope the investigation the Minister has launched goes some way towards telling us who is making the big money.</P>
    <P>It was the manner in which the beef processors operated over the years which created a <i>prima facie</i> case of anti-competitive practice. I am dismayed, however, that after three years of investigation, the Competition Authority has not been able to ascertain the facts. Farmers tell me they feel there is a cartel in operation. It might be by chance that everyone is paid the same price but hopefully the investigation will nail this problem once and for all. There are three eminent people involved and I have no doubt they will not leave a stone unturned and will report back in three months.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are of the view that they got cleaned out. The factories made £50 or £60 per beast while farmers got 82p for their O grades and 84p for their R grades. From September to December 1999 the market conditions were positive, as the Minister announced himself. There was a stronger dollar and the European markets were opening up. We were concentrating on quality but prices were in reverse. There are factors for which I cannot blame the Minister but, as Deputy Dukes said, the information gathered by the authority over the three year period must be put in the public domain. The Minister should respond to that call this evening.</P>
    <P>The ewe premium was fixed in Brussels yesterday. The Minister issued a statement but he did not comment at any stage about the difficulties experienced by sheep farmers in 1999, in spite of the fact that the ewe premium will be less than it was last year. There are also issues in relation to extensification premiums and equalisation. We will have to tackle those factors or we will get nothing.</P>
    <P>I have often talked about the administrative nightmare which exists for farmers. They are refused payments because of small, unintentional errors. We need a broadly based appeals system. Is it true that the application forms that we have in Ireland for the various premiums and subsidies <Col N="66" /> are the most complex in the European Union? That is what farmers believe. Many farmers applying for the REP scheme and the farm retirement scheme believe officials will refuse their applications if they have mispelt their names. That must stop. In the course of a committee debate, I outlined to the Minister an example of a farmer who was trying to comply with disease regulations and the REPS official told him he did not comply with the regulations of REPS. The prevention of disease in animals and the disease eradication scheme are far more important. Refusing an application because bushes were removed to ensure proper fencing is the sort of practice which must be stopped. Farmers face enough problems without imposing bureaucratic demands on them. If that is not stopped, it will create scenes comparable to those we have seen outside the factories. The Minister must act on behalf of sheep farmers because if he does not they will soon take to the streets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not believe it but it is with no great joy that I support the motion. We are reflecting the mood in the farming community at large. The Minister's tenure as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development over the last two and a half years has been particularly disappointing. Taking the cross sections of interests, cattle, sheep or pigs, with the exceptions of the dairy industry and beet production, all the main pillars of agricultural activity are in crisis. There is documented proof from the Minister's own Department of a 20% fall in incomes at a time of economic growth. That is proof positive that a serious crisis exists.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose is right. Not all the blame for that can be laid at the door of the Minister, but it is the impression of inactivity, the seeming disinterest, that has infuriated farmers most. I acknowledge the presence of two Government backbenchers in the House for this debate. It speaks volumes that those who represent rural constituencies are not here in great numbers to lend the Minister their moral, not to mention spoken, support in this debate. There is a widely held view that there is more sympathy in the Department for, and more consideration given to, initiatives for alternative enterprises such as race horses, rabbits and every other alternative enterprise than for mainstream farming activity. Those enterprises benefit only a small number of people. Those who have suffered this significant fall in income over the last two years see very little initiative on the part of those alternative enterprises to save their existence in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the motion before the House, we are reflecting the deep concern about people's futures and the lack of leadership on the part of the Department. The Taoiseach has an opportunity to do something about the problem tomorrow. As a Cork man, I would welcome the Minister's continued existence as a Minister but, for the sake of the national interest, it should not be <Col N="67" /> in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>The problems in the beef industry triggered this debate but they have been brewing for a long time. Reference has been made to a cartel. I hope the three wise men who have been appointed will bring forward proposals to end that. There is an element of restrictive practice but it is not the sole issue involved in the crisis in the beef industry. The Minister's failure to act on the cartel issue is only one of the reasons the beef industry is in crisis. Where are the proposals to rationalise the industry? Do we need 46 meat plants, most of which work one, two or three days a week to process all the cattle in the State? Rationalisation will not damage the cartel because the 46 plants are by and large owned by the three main players, the Goodman Group, Dawn Meats and Keepak. We must ask how long farmers can continue to support that level of inefficiency. There are five days in a working week and most plants work for two of those days. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that many of the cattle being slaughtered are not of high quality in terms of their grading. That is why we are not making progress in the markets which will deliver the best price. At the end of the day, the responsibility to bring forward proposals in this areas rests with the Minister but there have been no initiatives. The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation was established but there is no evidence of progress being made which will deliver income to farmers. That is what the debate is about, trying to redress that situation.</P>
    <P>The recent changes to the milk quota are further proof of good intentions but clumsy methods. The recently changed quota regime includes the proposal that farms which have quotas attached to them must be sold as going concerns. This measure will have serious consequences, particularly for small quota holders who want to sell their land and their quota. Someone will have to buy the farm and operate it as a going concern. This has serious constitutional implications because it discriminates against small quota holders.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues in the quota regime which I will make the subject of parliamentary questions in the future. There is considerable dissatisfaction among farmers and I do not have any hesitation in supporting the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;commends the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on his successful handling of the recent dispute between <Col N="68" /> beef processors and meat factories and for his handling of agricultural issues generally&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to respond to this debate. It would be better if more interest was shown in it. I commend the Deputies for their contributions which were sincerely made. There is no need to raise the decibel level or the level of insult in order to bring about a resolution of this question. I was particularly pleased to hear Deputy Penrose refer to the meat factory workers. Up to 5,000 workers in the beef industry and the general ancillary industries had no pay packets for the past two weeks and very few people commented on this. It is a pity that this dispute was politicised. I noted that a commentator in one of our national newspapers said that Fine Gael's involvement in the dispute was breathtakingly cynical. That is a pity. The dispute was serious and unprecendented but I am thankful that it is over. As Deputy Penrose said, some good may come out of it and I believe we are in a better position now than we were two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues in Government for their wholehearted support for me, both in my handling of the recent dispute between the beef producers and processors and in my handling of agricultural issues generally. I reject the Opposition motion in total and in detail. It is irrelevant to the issues which lay at the heart of the events of the past few weeks and is even more irrelevant to the development of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>While the decision by the meat processors to increase the meat inspection slaughter charge to farmers by 0.25p per lb might well have been an issue in the build up to the dispute the real and more fundamental cause was a general dissatisfaction on the part of farmers with the prices paid by the factories and a long-standing mistrust between both sides. Anybody with a basic understanding of the issues would accept that to be the case and this became even more clear as the dispute progressed.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the considerable misunderstanding and ill-founded comments about the meat inspection service. EU legislation sets down minimum requirements in relation to veterinary supervision of slaughtering, cutting and processing operations. In the case of plants which slaughter cattle, a permanent presence is required in our factories. These are, however, the minimum requirements and our customers, particularly in third country markets impose additional requirements which we must comply with if we are to continue to do business with them. While our veterinary inspection system may seem relatively expensive, it must be seen in the context of our multi-billion pound industry. No other country is as dependent on export markets and for that reason our inspection system must be one which safeguards the reputation of the industry and ensures that our exports meet the demanding requirements of our customers. In all, we export beef to more than 60 countries worldwide. Comparisons are sometimes made with countries which have their own domestic market which we <Col N="69" /> do not. We have to export nine out of every ten steers produced. Our veterinary inspection service has served the industry well, particularly in the three years since the BSE crisis of 1996. This can be seen from our success in retaining access to our major markets in spite of the upheaval which followed the BSE crisis. The fact that we have retained these markets and have been able, as we did recently in the case of Russia, to lift restrictions imposed on us is due to the in-depth audit and examination of our inspection systems. No fewer than 13 inspections have been carried out by third country customers since 1996. This is not to mention regular inspections by EU authorities and regular visits by major EU retail buyers. More and more, the retail buyers want to see our system on the ground. They visit our plants and our farms and it is important that we maintain the highest standards if we are to access and retain markets. The system has stood up to intense scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The question of reorganising the beef inspection service prior to moving to full cost recovery has been raised. There have also been suggestions that there should be a greater degree of self regulation on the part of the meat industry. As far as reorganising the inspection service is concerned, my Department commissioned a report in 1995 from Ernst and Young. This report, which was submitted to my predecessor in 1996, included a series of recommendations which the report claimed would reduce significantly the cost of the service. The main recommendations were as follows: temporary veterinary inspectors should be replaced by auxiliaries; veterinary certificates should be replaced by commercial documents; and animal movements should be computerised in order to reduce the time spent by veterinary staff in tracing cattle.</P>
    <P>The 1996 BSE crisis, however, effectively prevented the implementation of the first two recommendations. The permanent veterinary presence was a major factor in our success in retaining access to our major markets and most of our customers in the European Union insisted on veterinary certificates being retained. We are, of course, quite prepared to replace veterinary certificates by commercial documents wherever these are acceptable to the customers of our beef exporters. The third main recommendation &ndash; the computerisation of animal movement &ndash; has now been completed and its full implementation from 1 January is one of the factors behind the timing of the move to full recovery.</P>
    <P>Any move in the direction of self-regulation would require changes to EU regulations and would have to be seen in the context of various scares in the meat industry in recent years. Nevertheless, I am in favour, in principle, of transferring some of the responsibility for meat inspection to the industry itself but any move towards self-regulation would have to be consistent with EU regulations, comply with the principles governing meat hygiene and be acceptable to our major customers abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> I wish to set out the facts on meat inspection fees. The Rainbow Coalition Government decided in March 1996 to recover the full cost of meat inspection services from the meat industry on an individual plant basis. The same Government decided, in November 1996 to postpone implementation of the decision until July 1997. It is ironic that the Opposition berates me for implementing a decision taken by them when in Government.</P>
    <P>After various discussions and studies it was decided in the middle of last year to implement that decision from the beginning of this year. That decision was taken in the context of a rising price environment. I ask those who level this criticism to tell me when in the past two years it would have been a good time to implement this decision. However, implementation could not be delayed indefinitely and I am satisfied that following the implementation of computerisation of cattle movements in line with the recommendation of the Ernst and Young report it was opportune to implement the decision. There are numerous analogies in regard to paying for the cost of services provided by the State.</P>
    <P>At the core of this dispute lay the mistrust between producers and processors. Unfortunately this is deep-seated and is fuelled on a regular basis by allegations of excessive profiteering by the meat factories on the basis of cartel type activities. My predecessor asked the Competition Authority in 1997 to examine these allegations but the authority has not yet been able to amass sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution. The investigation, however, is continuing. The investigation by the Competition Authority is in effect a criminal investigation and a high level of proof is required. My Department co-operated fully with the Competition Authority in its investigation and supplied it with all the information available, particularly in relation to prices paid by individual meat plants.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to establish an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the industry and the reasons for the large differential between producer and consumer prices. This group is chaired by the former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and includes two highly respected economists, Professor Séamus Sheehy of UCD and Mr. Colm McCarthy of DKM Consultants. The group has been asked to complete its report by the end of April. This is an effective and rapid way to deal with this matter and take it off the table once and for all.</P>
    <P>The objective of the study is to establish the factual position on allegations about anti-competitive practices without having to meet the high levels of proof required by a criminal investigation. Should evidence of anti-competitive practices be uncovered, the Government will take whatever steps are necessary to terminate them. The examination of the differential between producer and consumer prices should also help to <Col N="71" /> identify the reasons for the large differential and, more importantly, whether excessive margins are being made at any points in the food chain. The results of the study should facilitate a more rational debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government also took a decision last week to establish a market price transparency mechanism based on independent verification. While substantial progress had already been made in the monitoring committee which I set up last year to implement certain of the recommendations of the beef task force, this decision will expedite progress on this matter. I expect the price transparency mechanism based on independent verification will be finalised at an early date within the context of the monitoring committee. I want to lay to rest the question of price transparency.</P>
    <P>Farming is cyclical. If prices are good, farmers are entitled to a good price and if they are bad, farmers are at least entitled to know what the market is returning. This system will provide that. I intend to publish what individual plants pay for each grade on a weekly basis so that this mistrust will be put out of the way and that a real partnership will develop. Great progress is being made in some areas, such as Deputy Penrose's, where a large differential is being paid for quality. We must move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Farmers did not object to the decision on full cost recovery of the meat inspection service <i>per se</i>. What they did object to was the attempt by the meat processors to pass on to them in full the increased cost through an across the board flat charge. It was not my Department's understanding that the increased cost would be passed to farmers through this mechanism and it was made clear at an early stage in the dispute that the processors were not entitled to increase the levy on an across the board basis. That basis gave credence to the existence of a cartel in the sector. Following a meeting with my Department on 13 December, the meat processors reversed the increase in the slaughter charge on producers but this failed to defuse the situation. This confirms that the issue of the meat inspection charge was not central to the dispute and the misguided nature of the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>While I am not defending the action of the meat processors, the increased slaughter charge imposed amounted to 25p per lb and was insignificant relative to the price increase of 7p per lb sought by the IFA. I accept the meat inspection charge is an important issue and its operational efficiency merits serious and rational consideration. We have agreed to set up a technical committee consisting of representatives of my Department to examine implementation details, including the definition of full recoverable cost and any efficiencies which can be identified in the system. It is a good credible service, which is recognised and accepted worldwide, but if we can reduce the costs, that will be done. The principle of full cost recovery has, however, been fully accepted by the IMA. In a nutshell, the levy was <Col N="72" /> not central to the dispute, a strong and credible meat inspection service is vital for our industry, the decision on the levy was not hasty and the decision to pass the full cost to the farmer was taken by the factories.</P>
    <P>As far as price is concerned, the IFA believed the meat factories enjoyed excessive profits last year, especially last autumn. In particular, it felt the benefits of the higher prices on export markets and the stronger dollar were not being passed on to producers. There was also a view among the farming community that the beef exporters were cutting each other's throats on third country markets in the knowledge that the weaker prices could be passed back to producers.</P>
    <P>The meat processors, on the other hand, rejected the charge of excessive profiteering and insisted that cattle prices were determined on the basis of market realities. They did concede, however, that we are now operating in a rising price environment because of a better balance in the EU market, the elimination of intervention stocks and lower cattle supplies in Ireland and that prices were likely to move up over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The non-price issues related mainly to trading relations between farmers and meat factories and involved, in essence, greater transparency in certain practices operated by the meat factories. I do not want to annoy Deputy Creed again but I must outline what was on the shopping list of the IFA. Price was the core issue. As far as I was concerned, getting rid of mistrust and building up partnership were the important matters but there were other issues.</P>
    <P>The IFA was seeking to have cattle price quotations by meat plants made on a VAT exclusive basis and to have the insurance scheme for rejected cattle operated by meat plants subject to separate accounting to ensure farmers were not being overcharged. It also wanted some changes made to the clean cattle policy implemented at meat plants and to appoint liaison officers to improve customer relations between farmers and meat factories. This is necessarily a simplistic summary of the issues in dispute but it serves to demonstrate that the dispute was essentially between the IFA and meat processors, a fact acknowledged by anybody with an appreciation of the reality of the matter.</P>
    <P>From an early stage I foresaw that the dispute, if prolonged, could inflict considerable damage on the industry. For this reason, I took a proactive role to bring it to an end as quickly as possible. The sequence of events demonstrate I did that. The IMA was met on Thursday, 13 January to seek to resolve the issue of the meat inspection charges. The agreement by my Department to the establishment of the technical committee, combined with the decision of the IMA on 14 January to reverse the increase in the slaughter charge to producers, effectively took the meat inspection fee issue out of the dispute. Unfortunately, since this was never a central issue, it did not succeed in unlocking the impasse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> Over the weekend of 15-16 January, I spent 12 hours mediating between the IFA and IMA. Substantial progress was made, especially with regard to transparency and building up relations between both sides. However, it was not possible to finalise all issues involved. It took more than one telephone call to get both sides together. This was a difficult dispute and court cases were taking place parallel to my efforts to mediate. The decision of the leading representatives of the IFA to resign from their positions following the judgment of the High Court on Monday, 17 January, delayed resumption of the discussions until Wednesday, 19 January.</P>
    <P>The discussions went on through the night and into Thursday morning. In total, I chaired discussions lasting 27 hours, which surely indicates my commitment to ending the dispute. I am satisfied that the progress achieved during these negotiations, particularly on price and other issues, provided a valuable framework for the successful resolution of the dispute over the weekend. Without these discussions, it would not have been possible to conclude the local individual negotiations.</P>
    <P>On price, the discussions succeeded in significantly bridging the gap between the price of 83p per lb on offer by the meat factories for O grade cattle and the 90p per lb sought by the IFA. While the meat factories' final indicative offer of 87.5p per lb fell short of the IFA's demand, it represented considerable progress and provided the basis for further negotiation on prices at local level between individual meat factories and their suppliers.</P>
    <P>It is open to question whether the price should be fully resolved centrally. Given the nature of the trade and the different markets supplied, a dispute on price could be finally settled only on the basis of negotiations between the factories and suppliers at local level. What I set out to do, and I believe I succeeded, was to establish a framework within which local negotiations could take place. These negotiations have been successful and I am pleased that normal work has now resumed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Government took a strong interest, and an active role, in settling the dispute. The Government decided, at its meeting at Ballaghdereen on 19 January, to establish a market price transparency system based on independent verification. That is the key to the dispute. No farmer will believe what a factory will tell him about price and <i>vice versa</i>. Independent audit and verification are needed. That has been put in place. The independent committee to examine the cartel allegations was an important step towards the settlement of the dispute and took an important and thorny issue off the table.</P>
    <P>Given that my primary objective in setting up the beef task force was to improve business relations between producers and processors, it is now essential that all the interests in the industry &ndash; farmers, the factories, workers &ndash; should put the recent dispute behind them. They need to <Col N="74" /> have better customer relations and to work in partnership for the overall development of the industry. The report of the beef task force which represents the distilled wisdom of the entire industry is now more relevant than ever and must remain the blueprint for the future development of the industry. This task force had farmers and processors on it and was chaired by Mr. John Malone, the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
    <P>Among the major issues dealt with by the task force which should be highlighted is the need to take full account of consumer requirements, especially concerning food safety. Also there is the need to refocus the marketing efforts of our industry on the high value EU retail sector. The blueprint for the future of the sector set out by the task force also addresses the hugely important issues of investment in processing and value-added products, and on farm efficiency. There is a need for partnership between processors and producers. The industry depends on an integrated two-way approach if it is to develop its full potential in the years ahead. If proof was needed, last week's events showed clearly how necessary this partnership is. There is also a need to encourage better breed selection in our cattle production as some 80% of cattle produced are not ideal for remunerative retail outlets in the EU. Funding to support this objective will be provided in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the recent dispute could damage relations with our customers in the EU. In view of this, I met with the chairman and chief executive of An Bord Bia on Monday last to discuss the effects of recent developments in the beef sector on the international marketing of Irish beef and to take immediate action to address the situation. I asked An Bord Bia to devise in particular a strategy to address any damage which might have been done by the interruption in supply to the servicing of our extremely important EU customers. A dreadfully difficult situation arose following the BSE crisis in 1996. A great deal of credit must be given to farmers and the industry for regaining a foothold in markets and ensuring their product was placed on supermarket shelves once again. Last year, 416,000 head of cattle were exported live from Ireland and this is alongside meat industry exports. That situation in 1996 was not easy. If any other industry were hit by a crisis such as BSE, it would not have recovered so quickly. The beef industry did and it would be tragic if it were to lose ground now because of this dispute.</P>
    <P>The debate has been worthwhile. We have had a difficult dispute which has been settled. Work remains to be done. The price transparency mechanism has been put in place. The &ldquo;three wise men&rdquo; committee has been put in place to dispense once and for all with allegations of a cartel. Liaison officers will be appointed by the IFA at local plant level. A great deal of good has <Col N="75" /> resulted. This was an unprecedented dispute to which there was no magic wand solution. My role was to create a framework to enable the industry to return to business. I achieved that and I defend my role as Minister. I am prepared to be judged on my prompt and effective mediation in the recent dispute and on my record generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent dispute between producers and processors served to highlight the fundamental problems which still persist in the beef industry. Farmers had a justifiable grievance about the prices they were receiving from the factories for their cattle. I am glad that that grievance has been addressed and that agreement on pricing has now been reached at all the plants throughout the country. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development moved calmly but firmly to defuse the crisis when it arose. He brought the two sides together &ndash; a significant achievement in itself in the circumstances &ndash; and worked hard with his officials and advisers to thrash out an agreement between them. The fact that the plants are back to normal production today is testament to the success of the approach adopted by the Minister in this dispute.</P>
      <P>The beef industry is not short of advice from experts or reports from consultants. It has been repeatedly analysed and the problems besetting the industry have been identified more than once. The industry had been making progress through the 1990s. Dependence on intervention and export refunds had been declining as processors made inroads into high-quality retail markets in Britain and continental Europe. However, the industry was sent reeling backwards by the BSE crisis. Valuable markets were lost through no fault of our own and we were forced into a renewed dependence on subsidies to get our product into third country markets.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed on the kind of beef industry we want to see here. We want a modern, well developed industry capable of selling high-quality, high-value products to the supermarkets of Britain, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. That is the kind of industry which will be able to command the highest prices on international markets for Irish beef. That is the kind of industry which will be able to return the highest prices to Irish producers and to do so on a consistent and continuing basis. This is the direction in which we want to move and I welcome the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and of An Bord Bia to help rebuild Ireland's presence in the European beef market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The recent dispute has highlighted a huge distrust between producers and processors. This is not the kind of foundation on which a strong, high-quality exporting industry can be built. We live in an era of social and economic partnership. Both producers and processors are parties to the national partnership through their representative organisations. Why can we not have partnership at industry level between producers and processors? That might seem fanciful given the ferocity of the dispute which has just ended, but both sides have a vested interest in working together if this industry is ever to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>The quality of the raw material needs to be improved, but farmers will not produce better quality without the guarantee of better prices. The quality of our beef markets needs to be improved, but processors will not chase those markets unless they can be sure they have the type of cattle which is needed. Sophisticated industries are built on sophisticated relationships between producers and processors. If the beef industry can move away from confrontation to co-operation, the interests of all involved will be better served.</P>
    <P>If we are to have co-operation, we will need to build confidence first. That is why the Government moved last week to appoint an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry. This group will report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in three months and I hope that its findings provide the foundation for a new relationship between producers and processors in the beef industry. The interests of consumers must not be neglected. The independent group has also been asked to examine why there is such a large difference between the price received by producers and the price paid by consumers.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, on the monitor and latterly to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, reading the script of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Neither put up much of a defence for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development nor an attack against the motion of no confidence in him. I listened to him repeatedly say that the dispute was about mistrust between the farmers and the meat factories and that anyone who knows anything about it is aware it was about mistrust, that it did not involve him and that everything will be rosy in the garden after the &ldquo;three wise men&rdquo; group reports. It is not like that. Anyone who knows anything about the beef industry knows it operates as a cartel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" />
    </P>
    <P>Farmers know this, as they made patently clear in recent days. The best friend of the cartel is the Minister. This has been the case for a very long time. The first thing Mr. Haughey did on his return in 1987 was to appoint the Minister to the newly created post of Minister of State with special responsibility for the food industry. His task was to kick start the beef industry. They are not my words but those of the Minister advanced at the beef tribunal. It ended up meaning giving buckets of taxpayers' money to the Goodman Group. The colleagues of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in the Progressive Democrats were as concerned as I was at the time about this. In the interests of prolonging the Government that may no longer be the case.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money was spent in compiling the famous beef development plan to which Deputy Connaughton referred. Most of us remember the 1988 press conference at which it was launched. The then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, sulked in the corner because the Minister was positioned at the right hand of the great man. The Minister was the man charged with giving leadership to the beef development plan, which was a mirage and a fantasy. Mr. Justice Hamilton quantified the cheap loans given to Goodman International as the equivalent of £30 million. A total of £112 million was provided by way of cheap section 84 loans. This was money he could not have obtained had it not been for the beef development plan. Senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach and the IDA were saying to the banks, &ldquo;You must give out this money because we have the biggest plan ever to develop an indigenous industry&rdquo;, but it never happened. As Members are aware, a brick was never put upon a brick. At the same time as the beef development plan was being advanced, the Minister was engaged with Deputy Albert Reynolds in finding third country markets for the raw material that was to be the subject matter of the plan that never happened. That was the fraud perpetrated on the people and the final piece of the jigsaw fell into place on 8 March 1988 when Mr. Haughey and Mr. Ó hÚiginn caused the IDA to drop the performance clause contrary to law as found by Mr. Justice Hamilton.</P>
    <P>On 6 February 1990, in the absence of the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister and the meat processors hatched a plan to do down a small meat importer, Emerald Meats, the details of which were the subject of a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation in recent months. The main beneficiary of this rip off was Goodman and it has already cost the taxpayer £1 million. There is a claim for damages of £7 million which has yet to be assessed by the courts. This is happening under the nose of the Minister who did nothing to stop it but he cannot afford to take action. He could not afford to take action at Rathkeale where there was grand larceny to get any of the money back. He could not do anything about the Bureau Veritas affair and now he is surprised that even the farmers are in revolt. They know they <Col N="78" /> have been ripped off by the cartel and those who make up the cartel.</P>
    <P>I have heard comments about the reference of the matter to the Competition Authority by the rainbow Government and the then Minister, Deputy Yates, but the fact is there has been minimal co-operation by the Department with the authority. The Tánaiste said little information was provided to enable it do its job. Because it is politically expedient the Taoiseach and the Minister have circumvented the authority by establishing a group to introduce a fixer's solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Last week a senior officer who had quit the Department years earlier was convicted of selling health certificates. How did he get back in? A plan was hatched in Clontarf Rugby Club between former Minister Ray Burke and a serving official of the Department&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir. A former Member and a serving official of the Department brought a proposal to the Minister to have him reinstated. Against advice he imposed this man who was convicted last week as reported in the public press on the north east division.</P>
      <P>More recently the Minister was unable to explain how a product labelled &ldquo;beef&rdquo; which was not intended for sale on the home market was on sale to domestic consumers in Clondalkin. Following investigations by Teagasc it turned out to be pork. A Minister who does not want to know the difference between beef and pork does not deserve the confidence of this House. It was the Minister's actions which triggered the latest dispute between farmers and the beef industry. He knows this. So does the House.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet decided in March 1996 that FEOGA funds should be administered by a separate agency outside the aegis of the Department. This decision was reinforced by the Government. The Taoiseach indicated on the Order of Business that the necessary Bill would be put through the House but to put it at its kindest the Minister has been frustrated by the Department. I bear him no personal ill will and do not want to make any personal allegations. I am speaking politically. The Department has subverted that decision and the Minister has gone along with it. A Bill has yet to emerge to implement the Cabinet decision of 1996, which has been supported by the Government, that the funds should be administered by a separate agency outside the maw of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no co-operation with the Competition Authority. The cartel meets every second Monday in 11 Merrion Square. At one stage the Minister sent in officials to find out how it is done. That is what is happening in the industry. The Minister is sitting on top of the heap and is the meat factories' man. It is no wonder farmers <Col N="79" /> could not expect fair mediation. I regret to say the Minister does not deserve the confidence of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be difficult to follow that. Having spoken to farmers on the picket line and workers and management in some of the factories affected during the dispute, Deputy Rabbitte's references are on everybody's lips. Whether perception or fact, people believe a cartel is operating in the beef industry for the benefit of a select group of individuals who have made millions on the backs of producers and at the expense of consumers.</P>
      <P>In page 23, chapter 4, of its report the task force established by the Minister accepted that the overall objectives of the industry will not be achieved unless producers are adequately remunerated for their labour and investment and the production of high quality products is properly rewarded. It also accepted that income improvement can be achieved only through a price structure which rewards quality, the establishment of integrated producer-processor supply arrangements and improving production efficiency and product quality at farm level.</P>
      <P>During the debate at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the height of the dispute I suggested that if the Minister required additional legislative powers all parties in the House would assist him and indicated that we objected to the softly, softly approach he had adopted. I have not previously witnessed the level of anger and frustration among producers which was evident on the picket lines. It was obvious from our debate in the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there was a perceived suspicion a cartel was operating. The Minister accepted that. It could not have been coincidental that factories were charging the same prices and that they all made the same decision to pass on the charges. The charges were necessary to ensure the examination of a good quality product. However, there is much room for improvement in the efficiencies of the operation of meat inspection on the factory floors. Veterinarians who engage in private practice come into the factories at particular times and overlap with others. There is a fee involved in the overlapping of times for killing. Those practices must stop. We are all collectively responsible for ensuring the product is produced to the correct EU standards and that someone who can be trusted to do the job properly is paid to be present at all times. This issue cannot be dealt with on a part-time basis as is happening at present. The Minister agrees that transparency is imperative in this matter. Farmers have sought transparency and the Minister has committed himself to providing it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, stated on local radio that this issue did not suddenly arise in January but was a bomb waiting to explode.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not. I would not look at the Minister of State on television. The Minister of State was on radio which was received at local level and he stated he knew this issue was going to blow up.

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing to this important debate. The turmoil of the past number of weeks has shaken the beef industry. The fall-out of the recent dispute is considerable and its implications will be felt for some time to come. Regardless of the outcome of this evening's votes or that of tomorrow's Cabinet reshuffle, the Minister who will be in Agriculture House on Friday morning must immediately turn his or her attention to the restoration of confidence in the beef sector and towards ensuring all elements of the beef industry can work effectively together to improve the quality of Irish produce and the price which beef farmers secure for their product.</P>
      <P>Before I turn to the dispute between the farmers and the beef processors, I want to raise the plight of the thousands of meat plant workers who were laid off during the recent dispute. These workers suffered a great deal in recent weeks but their situation received scant attention from the media or the Government. Meat factory workers work long and hard for a week's wages and the financial loss suffered by thousands of families in recent weeks must be resolved. I urge the Minister and his colleagues and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to immediately commence talks with SIPTU, which represents many of the workers, to try to hammer out an equitable compensation package for workers who lost out on much needed pay packets through no fault of their own. I am aware that some individual settlements have been agreed with workers and I urge the Minister to use these as a model to ensure workers are not left out of pocket as a result of this dispute.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept a great deal of responsibility for precipitating the dispute which paralysed our beef industry. The Minister's actions in relation to the increase in the veterinary charges is in direct conflict with his stated policy objectives. In various speeches and statements the Minister made since taking up office, he made it clear that the beef industry could not lurch from one crisis to another. He stated that the industry required clear goals and objectives and that all elements of the industry should work in partnership to achieve these goals. Fine words, but the Minister's actions in recent weeks conflict directly with this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister increased the veterinary inspection charge and walked away from its implemen<Col N="81" /> tation. The processors passed on the charge directly to the farming community and the Minister's belated objections were too little, too late. The recent dispute, which was one of the most serious agricultural disputes in the history of the State, brought the beef industry to a standstill. For a Minister who claims to have such a sure touch when it comes to agricultural matters, this debacle raised serious questions about his ability to forge a new future for Irish agriculture in a rapidly changing international market.</P>
    <P>The imposition of veterinary fees was the straw which broke the camel's back and the pent-up anger and frustration, which thousands of farmers throughout the country legitimately felt, came to the fore. While I do not condone farmers for disobeying a High Court injunction, they had a legitimate case in regard to the practices of the beef processors. That the price per pound for beef varies so little throughout the country can only lead to the conclusion that there is a large degree of co-operation between meat factories to the detriment of farmers and consumers. The price per pound paid to farmers does not bear any relation to the price paid by consumers in the butchers or the supermarket.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the independent group to examine allegations in regard to the operation of price cartels and I look forward to its report. If we are serious about ensuring the long-term future of the family farm, it is essential that farmers receive a decent price for their produce. One of the most serious threats to the future of rural Ireland is the decline in farm family incomes, the ongoing flight from the land and the serious depopulation of rural Ireland. Hundreds of farmers in my constituency and throughout the country face a bleak future. The land they have worked, often for generations, now generates such a low turnover that neither their sons nor their daughters are prepared to enter into farming. This is the major challenge facing any Minister with responsibility for agriculture. It is one of the major challenges facing any Government or political party which is concerned with the well-being of the rural section of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we learn a lesson from the recent dispute and ensure powerful processors are not allowed to ride roughshod over the future of thousands of farming families. We must develop our beef industry and target new specialist markets in which added value can be achieved for Irish beef. The food industry must be supported to ensure Irish workers and Irish towns benefit from the increased food production which is essential to the future of Irish rural life. In regard to heifer producers, £4 less is being received for graded R 3s than for O 3s. A vital opportunity was missed to assist this sector of the beef industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte and his colleagues for sharing their time. The massive confrontation we have seen in the beef industry was a crisis waiting to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Given the deep seated structural problems in the beef sector, the farming community and the meat factory owners were clearly on a collision course in the absence of effective Government management. Instead of that effective stewardship, we had the Government mismanagement of the meat inspection issue which was the torch which lit the bonfire.</P>
    <P>The mood of militancy among farmers throughout the State was seldom witnessed heretofore. Farmers, their families and supporters turned out in huge numbers at meat factories throughout the country. I witnessed the justifiable mood of anger and determination when I visited and addressed the picketing farmers at the Liffey Meats plant at Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, last week. There was a sense that the farmers had endured more than enough at the hands of the meat factory owners and that the time of reckoning had come. I commend the farmers on their militancy. Direct action was needed to challenge the cartel operating in the beef industry and it was remarkable that the action won widespread public support far beyond the farming community itself. That was represented throughout the length and breadth of the State.</P>
    <P>The crisis was deepened by the use of the courts against the Irish Farmers' Association by the meat plant owners. The imposition of massive fines on the IFA stands in stark contrast to the lack of action taken against those corrupt sectors of the industry exposed in the beef tribunal. The use of the courts by the factories showed a punitive approach and a lack of commitment to resolving the dispute. The farmers have now been vindicated in their claim that what was effectively a cartel was operating in the beef industry. This penalised both farmers and consumers in terms of price. I hope this IFA action and the local bargaining which has now been undertaken is the beginning of the end of the cartel. Local direct action has lead to local bargaining, an effective exercise in people power. However, the problems in the beef industry remain. The domination of the industry by the three big players, AIBP, Dawn Meats and Kepak may yet reverse the progress made by the IFA in securing 90p per pound.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a working group by the Government to examine the beef industry looks like a measure conjured up simply to be seen to be doing something. That such a working group to investigate whether there are anti-competitive practices in the beef industry and ascertain the reason for the differential between the producer and the consumer price should still be necessary is in itself an indictment of the Government. Years after the tribunal and several other investigations into the sector, we are apparently back to the drawing board once again. Successive Governments have failed to confront corruption, mismanagement and malpractice in the beef sector. The farmer and the consumer have paid the price as a result. I point the finger equally at the Minister's Fine Gael predecessor in this regard. <Col N="83" /> Mismanagement of the beef industry has been one of the glaring failures of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I must reluctantly support the motion of no confidence in the Minister. I recognise that he has a strong personal commitment to farming. I have no difficulty in stating that I hold him in high personal regard. However, it is impossible for me, as an elected Member of this House, to have confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, given the Government's role in the precipitation of the crisis in the beef industry, because the Government actually set off the chain of events which precipitated the crisis. Like its Fine Gael predecessor, it has refused to challenge the beef industry cartel. That is at the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>The crisis of the past few weeks put the jobs of thousands of meat factory workers in jeopardy. These workers must not be forgotten. They suffered significant loss of earnings. I use the opportunity this evening to call on the relevant sectors to ensure that full compensation is made to every one of those workers without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Power and Johnny Brady, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>It sometimes amuses me to hear Deputy Ó Caoláin. He does not need to explain his reasons for voting against the Government, he is being consistent. I am sorry Deputy Rabbitte has left. He mentioned the word &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo;. Let me ask him about a pedigree that dates back from the Labour Party to the Democratic Left Party, to the Workers Party, to Sinn Féin the Workers Party, and Sinn Féin, a party where they did not know that money was being printed on a printing press that came from the Stasi, the east German police. Deputy Rabbitte is such an expert on the beef tribunal, but he was three years in the Department of Enterprise and Employment as Minister of State and did not once help to define to the authority that there was a cartel. There is no proof of that in that Department. Deputy Rabbitte prefers to grab the headlines than to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address some of the issues raised in the debate. On the issue of meat inspection fees, it is evident that while this issue may have triggered the dispute between the farmers and the meat factories, it was never the central issue, which centred around cattle prices and other issues relating to trading relations between farmers and meat factories. The Opposition cannot deny that it was its Government which took the decision in March 1996 to impose full cost recovery and which reaffirmed that decision in November 1996. Contrary to the impression being given in this debate, the Government did not set down pre-conditions in relation to the <Col N="84" /> reorganisation of the veterinary inspection system. I agree that the meat processors were not entitled to pass on the full cost of the new recovery system to producers. The Department made this clear at a very early stage in this dispute. Furthermore, following a meeting with the Department on 13 January, the meat processors withdrew the increased slaughter charge. The Minister played a pivotal role in the context of the harsh words he spoke to the meat industry at that time.</P>
    <P>The price of cattle was the central issue in the dispute. This can be seen clearly from the fact that the dispute continued after the meat inspection fees issue had been resolved. The increase in the meat inspection fee, which amounted to 0.2p per pound, imposed by the meat processors paled into insignificance beside the 7p per pound increase in price sought by the farmers.</P>
    <P>The meat inspection service has served us well down the years. That has been a major factor in maintaining access for Irish beef to our major export markets. It is often forgotten that veterinary inspectors from other countries, Israel, Egypt and Iran, are happy to see stringent veterinary inspection in factories here, which complements the work they are sent to do.</P>
    <P>Ideally we would favour a greater degree of self-regulation on the part of the industry, provided the principles covering meat hygiene can be fully complied with and that it meets the requirements of our customers abroad. In any event, a greater degree of self-regulation would require changes in EU regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for failing to ensure proper competition in the meat processing sector and for failing to introduce a transparent pricing mechanism. This criticism is totally unfounded. The Minister has done more than any other Minister to progress the principle of price transparency, which was one of the recommendations of the task force which he set up in November 1998. He delegated implementation of this recommendation to the monitoring committee and, because of lack of progress within that committee, the Government has accepted the Minister's proposal for a price transparency mechanism based on independent verification. The Government has also established an independent group to examine the issue of anti-competitive practices within the meat processing sector in order to determine whether such practices exist. The complexity of this issue can be seen from the fact that the Competition Authority has been unable to prove anything three years into its investigation. However, the independent group will not be required to meet the same level of proof required by the Competition Authority, and this group has been asked to submit its report by the end of April. Its findings should help to establish once and for all whether the meat processing sector is guilty of anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the amendment proposed by the Government. The Minister deserves to be <Col N="85" /> congratulated for his handling of the dispute and his efficiency. It is not the ones who shout the loudest or who appear on television most of the time who achieve the most, but those who work quietly. The Minister worked more than 30 hours over one weekend alone to solve the dispute. The early intervention of the Department and the Minister's efforts over the weekend of 15-16 January and again over the weekend of 19-20 January produced the framework for the successful conclusion of negotiations between farmers and meat processors at local level last weekend. The Minister's intervention facilitated discussions between both sides. It brought the dispute to an end more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. There would not have been any discussions between the two sides without the Minister's intervention because of the bitter stand-off between them arising from the blockades and the legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Any objective commentator will realise that the Minister has been very successful during his period of office. His outstanding achievement was the outcome of the negotiations on Agenda 2000, decried by the Opposition, when he turned a potential loss of £1.4 billion to a net gain of £400 million. It stands as one of the most successful negotiations ever. He also negotiated a major allocation of £1.74 billion in FEOGA funding for the rural development plan, which we are proud to be implementing under the national development plan. The negotiation of £3.75 billion funding for direct investment in agriculture, food and rural areas under the national development plan was another major achievement. The huge increase in live exports last year &ndash; 416,000 animals went out of the country &ndash; is directly attributable to his efforts. He provided the ships and the customers on the other side. His achievements in the delivery of direct payments are commensurate with his success in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and he must be given full credit for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quiet and hardworking. He is a doer, rather than one who constantly wants to be on television. He does the work and the results will be apparent in the long-term.</P>

      <P>This motion is a shameful waste of Dáil time, reflected by the empty seats in the Press Gallery and in the Chamber. There is not even a Labour Party Member present and only two Members from the Fine Gael Party are in attendance. That is an indication of how seriously they take this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is from a frontbench that has little or no confidence in its spokesmen on Agriculture, Deputies Connaughton and Ring, who have been unable to map the Minister over the last two years. It is a motion of jealousy and begrudgery. The feeble attempts by the Fine Gael frontbench agriculture team at shadow boxing was such a major source of embarrassment to colleagues at <Col N="86" /> the height of the meat factories dispute last week, that the party was obliged to employ the services of two of its former Ministers for Agriculture, Deputies Dukes and Yates, to try to explain the Fine Gael position in both the<i> Irish Independent </i>and <i>The Irish Times.</i> It was an attempt to beef up the party's profile among farmers, but, as the latest opinion polls have shown, it was to little or no avail.</P>
    <P>Any objective person looking at the graph of farm income over the past 15 years can only conclude that Deputy Walsh has been one of the most successful Ministers for Agriculture the country has had.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the facts, not perception. The Minister negotiated the first CAP reform, which gave Irish farmers their four most prosperous years ever, between 1992-6, when farm incomes exceeded £2 billion for the first time in the history of the State. Incomes began to slip again during the tenure of the last Government, but when the Minister returned to office he faced the Agenda 2000 proposals, which could have resulted in a potential loss to farmers of £1.4 billion over the next seven years. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, outlined how the Minister turned that potential loss into a gain of £400 million, a remarkable achievement. The Fine Gael Party has done nothing to approach that performance.</P>
      <P>There was much criticism of the Department's decision to increase the inspection levies at meat factories, which caused the dispute between farmers and factory owners, although we all know the underlying cause of the pent-up anger and frustration among farmers was the poor price factories were paying them. The Department acted on a Government decision of 1996, made when the rainbow coalition was in power. It was the Government comprising of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left that decided the meat factories should pay for the full cost of the veterinary inspection charges. These parties then started to crib when the Department moved to implement the decision. How hypocritical can one get?</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte offered solutions to all the problems surrounding the dispute, but when there was a crisis in agriculture during the period when the previous Government was in power, his then ministerial colleague, Deputy De Rossa, refused to accept that there was a crisis and told farmers they were rolling in money. I am sure he still holds that view. It, therefore, ill-behoves the Opposition to lecture this side of the House. The Minister's record cannot be matched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael criticised the Minister for not getting involved earlier in the dispute. He was in contact with both sides from the outset and laid the foundations for the success that was achieved. He <Col N="87" /> oversaw an increase in the price offered by the factories from 82p per lb to 87.5p per lb in a very short space of time. From there it only required local bargaining to resolve matters.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Taoiseach will be obliged to make changes to the Cabinet. Deputy John Bruton would do his party much good if he took similar action with his own team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my strong support to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. He has done a superb job and Deputy Power is right to describe him as one of the finest Ministers for Agriculture the country has seen. Everybody knows this motion is blatant opportunism and nonsense. When we were on the Opposition benches we used Private Members' time to put forward constructive proposals. We developed alternative policies to deal with issues facing the entire spectrum of Irish life. By contrast, it appears the Opposition is redundant and incapable of generating even one new idea. A measure of its redundancy is its practice of the politics of negativity, or opposition for the sake of it.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows the Minister has been discharging his functions at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development effectively and well. Under his leadership the Department has preserved and developed the best interests of the farming community, the food industry and the wider agri-business sector. It is a complex and mammoth task because we should not lose sight of the fact that these sectors are the backbone of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not one to advance glib or shallow solutions to complex problems and he also knows his geography. Unlike the former Minister, Deputy Yates, he is not given to flights of fancy by pretending to be engaged in high level discussions with Russian veterinary authorities at Dublin Airport when simultaneously attending to the needs of his constituents in a pub while holding a clinic. Those on the Opposition benches who put their names to this motion appear to have excised that fiasco from their minds when they decided to embark on this episode of opportunistic posturing. I am glad to take this opportunity to remind the Fine Gael Members of the former Minister's fanciful flight into virtual reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has deservedly earned the commendation of the House. He was involved in the successful negotiation of the Agenda 2000 framework, which has put in place the policy framework for agricultural and rural development in the coming years. In the course of those negotiations, for which he was rightly praised by all quarters, he turned around a potential loss to Irish farmers of approximately £1.4 billion to a gain of £400 million. Total payments to farmers <Col N="88" /> in the food sectors in the coming years will be approximately £10 billion. If unprecedented success on this scale is the yardstick by which the Opposition Members judge failure, then they should embark on other careers, having failed dismally as practising politicians.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also had spectacular success in advancing unprecedented funding of £3.75 billion from the national development plan for direct investment in the agri sector over the coming seven years. He has negotiated an additional quota in the milk sector and put in place measures to ensure continued prosperity in the sector. He has also overseen a greatly accelerated regime of live cattle exports, with shipments now running at more than seven times the level of three years ago and he has put in place a state of the art system of processing and payment of direct income supports, with the result that the payment performance of his Department to farmers is now one of the best in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has an important job which touches on the performance of the wider economy and the fabric of community life throughout the country. He will not be deflected from this task by the parliamentary tactics of an Opposition which seems incapable of constructing policies. Why was this motion put down? It is quite clear to most people that it was put down in the hope by Fine Gael that Deputy Walsh would not have resolved this problem prior to coming back to the Dáil following the recess.</P>

This motion of no confidence is the latest manifestation of the continued strategy of no policies, which has been pursued by Fine Gael since it returned to its customary position of complacent indifference on the Opposition benches. Fine Gael's policy seems to be to do nothing, say nothing and criticise everything. It has succeeded in establishing its party in the public mind as a party which stands for nothing and against everything. Bereft of any policy initiatives, Fine Gael seems to have been reduced to filling its Private Member's time with hopeless motions of no confidence which serve as a wholly inadequate substitute for positive policy development. As a parliamentary strategy, Fine Gael's non-initiative is, to say the least, lacking as a contribution to the political life of this State.</P>

At the start of the 21st century Fine Gael is an &ldquo;expect <Col N="89" /> nothing and you will not be disappointed&rdquo; party. It has come to personify the vacuum which exists on the Opposition benches and has become little more than an empty vessel making expected noises. Its recent pronouncements suggest that thoughts given to its utterances are almost exclusively retrospective. Tonight's motion is an attack on a decent, hard-working and successful Minister by a party which has substituted soundbites for substance. It is the embodiment of the politics of nihilism, a motion to fill space which should be occupied by policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Minister is acutely aware of the importance of our beef industry to the national economy. More importantly, his Cabinet colleagues actively support him in this regard. Farmers are fortunate that this is the case. I do not need to dwell on the situation in the previous Government. This motion comes from those who had their hands tied while in Government and treated Irish farmers with contempt. It is obviously difficult for those people to acknowledge that the Government has given substantial support to farmers. This support was very necessary because of the unforeseen difficulties that beset the industry in the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the IFA, other farming organisations and individual farmers on persevering in their efforts to secure better deals from the factories. Their action has gone some way towards restoring dignity to producers. By their stance they have shown that they are taking control and demanding a fair return for their work. The year 1999 was a record one for cattle kills and the industry continued to make huge profits on the backs of producers. I compliment the Minister on his efforts in the negotiations with meat industry chiefs. Meat factories over the years have passed on every levy to the farmer and used every excuse to cut prices. The Irish Meat Association represents the factories who for too long have treated farmers as sacrificial lambs. They have tried to do likewise with the IFA. As a result of Deputy Walsh's efforts, we will now be in a position to monitor individual factory payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision to appoint a committee to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices by the meat plants. Transparency in pricing and grading will ensure that the factories do not return to their own way of doing things. The incomes of all those working in farming will be maximised and this major national industry will continue its important contribution to the national economy. Since becoming Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh has worked tirelessly on behalf of farmers. The outcome he achieved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations secured the long-term future for farmers' incomes. Through his tough negotiating stance he achieved a complete turn-around on proposals which would have destroyed our farming industry. The overall commitment of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to the support of agri<Col N="90" /> culture, food and rural development is very clear and beyond doubt. His wide-ranging support for all sectors speaks for itself. I will give a few examples.</P>
    <P>During last year's fodder and weather crises, he introduced a farm assist scheme targeted at low income farmers and a range of initiatives to encourage the early transfer of land to young, trained farmers. He reintroduced on-farm investment schemes, with an increase in the level of installation aid for young farmers. In regard to exports, he has taken necessary action since the Government came to office, when there were no beasts being exported live out of this country, and last year more than 400,000 live cattle were exported. The policies being developed by the Government have brought about an economic situation where those wishing to obtain employment to support their incomes from farming find it easier to do so. I am confident the Minister has ensured that there will now be an adequate mechanism in place to guarantee that prices in the future will represent market returns.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by the Opposition to mislead the country and the farming community. First, I congratulate Professor Seamus Sheehy on his appointment as head of the anti-competition group to examine the pricing structure of the beef industry. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh on bringing about a speedy conclusion to the IFA and IMA problems over the weeks. It was a difficult time for the Minister and the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and they all worked closely together in resolving the problem. I am glad everyone has gone back to work. I want to commend the workers on going back to work and also the service industry who also suffered much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all well aware of the success of the beef industry since this Government took office. Last year was very successful for the beef industry, when about 600,000 tonnes of cattle were slaughtered and about 545,000 tonnes of beef exported to 60 countries around the world. We have only a 10% consumption of beef produced, which is very small and marginal. We have to export practically all our beef which comes off Irish land. We have the largest beef export industry in northern Europe and, while other countries may have the same volumes of beef, they do not have the same export content. We slaughtered in the region of 2.5 million animals last year, which was very progressive. Of the total left in Ireland, 1.6 million heifers and steers and about 400,000 culled cows were killed or slaughtered and there were 400,000 live exports &ndash; it was the most successful year ever for live exports. A total of seven ships were licensed under the Minister's aegis and many problems arose, but they were handled very successfully. The Opposition often cries about live <Col N="91" /> exports, but this is a successful and expanding business.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the beef industry ? No solutions have come from that side of the House. The food development group and the beef task force were set up. The national plan provided for £41.5 billion. We have set out targets and areas which are important for the beef industry. There are 40 plants slaughtering animals. A new plan and structure for the beef industry is necessary if it is to be modernised.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the quality of our beef. However, quality has gone astray since the previous Government, of which Deputy Sheehan was a member, got rid of bull licensing and re-introduced to rural areas what we call scrub bulls.</P>

I compliment farmers for what they have done in the area of breeding, particularly in terms of sucklers. Some of the finest cattle and weanlings ever seen are being produced by suckler herds. We have the basis of a very strong and vibrant beef industry, but we will have to examine its structure and plan for the future.</P>
      <P>I compliment Bord Bia, the promotion agency, for the outstanding work being done. I am well aware of the difficulties which arise on the foreign markets and Deputy Walsh and I have been to more supermarkets, shops and facilities than any previous Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled the other night to hear Deputy Rabbitte make accusations in the House and attack an officer of the Department. There was no basis for his allegations in relation to the officer who was not reinstated by my Department at any time. Such false allegations do not do the <Col N="92" /> beef industry, the Department or the country any good. We should be more prudent in what we say.</P>
    <P>Since taking office food safety has been addressed. We are now examining the area of quality, which is vitally important. In this context not one single damaging thing has happened our beef industry while other countries throughout the world have had to deal with dioxin, ecoli 1057 and other difficulties. Ireland has remained protected from such problems since the Government took office in 1997 because it has worked hard, systematically and in a business like and efficient fashion, thereby saving the Irish farmer and the food industry.</P>
    <P>Last year we exported foodstuffs to the value of £5 billion and hope to increase this business. Beef is one of our major exports. We exported 230,000 tonnes of quality beef from dairy herds to Egypt and other north African and Third World markets. We reserve the right to examine continental breed crosses which are so important in terms of the French, Italian, Dutch, British and Scandinavian markets.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be in the House and am appalled that the Opposition has made such an attack on the Minister and the Government which is so successful in terms of agriculture. The Opposition does not have the answers. The Members opposite rant about agriculture. Our Minister was not in Enniscorthy when he was supposed to be in Dublin Airport. The Minister goes to where the problem is, and the Opposition should not make statements to mislead the public. Those now in Opposition failed when in office, are failing tonight and will be defeated in this motion. I assure the Opposition that the Government will be around for a long time.</P>

      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to speak tonight. We do not like tabling motions to the effect that we do not have confidence in a Minister. I like the Minister &ndash; he is a nice guy and I do not like having to table this motion.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State that Fianna Fáil backbenchers were telling farmers last week when they met them on the picket lines, that they were sorry to be in Government at this time and to have such disastrous Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This is not what Fine Gael was saying, but rather what Fianna Fáil backbenchers were saying. Tonight only one Fianna Fáil backbencher is in the House to support the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked why this motion had been tabled. A week is a long time in politics and farming. The motion has been tabled because farmers had to blockade every factory last week because of a cosy cartel. Every Sunday evening the cartel arrived in Punchestown or wherever &ndash; I am not a racing man but the Minister knows all about racing, he guided the helicopters to the racecourse. We all know about Larry. Our situation <Col N="93" /> is not unlike that depicted in the American soap opera where J.R. Ewing was in the oil company cartels. Here we have Larry and company in the cattle industry cartel. On a Sunday evening at a race meeting they would put £1,000, £2,000 or £5,000 on a horse and did not mind if they lost. They would then decide what to pay the farmers the following day, whether it should be 79p, 80p or 81p. That went on for a long time. If one kicks a dog for long enough, it will bite. The farmers were being kicked for long enough by the beef barons and they said &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>In 1988, before I became a member of the Dáil, the former Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey and the Fianna Fáil parade went around the country like Duffy's Circus, from Ballaghdereen to Cork accompanied by Larry, or &ldquo;J.R.&rdquo; saying Larry was the man who would revive the beef industry. The media would not tell the people what would happen. The only person who objected in 1988 was John Bruton, who was spokesperson for agriculture, I think. The Fianna Fáil people had to hold Larry back from attacking John Bruton at a press conference. John Bruton was right: he identified the problem then and knew what the problem would be in the future.</P>
    <P>I was delighted the <i>Irish Independent</i> covered a question I tabled in the Dáil. The last three priority questions I raised were covered as two exclusives in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> which did not even think it worth its while to mention my name. However, I have no problem with that. The <i>Irish Independent</i> ran a front page story on brucellosis as a result of a priority question which I tabled but this debate will not receive much coverage in the daily papers.</P>
    <P>The media does not have much interest in agriculture, but I will explain what the Government is doing. Everybody will remember the culled ewe scheme. There were three categories of culled ewe &ndash; boned, condemned and commercial. The Department provided money for those which were boned, condemned and commercial. The largest price was paid for the condemned category which included 77,967 culled ewes and for which in 1999 the Department paid £887,637 to factories.</P>

There is a cosy cartel and the poor farmers are being squeezed left, right and centre with nobody doing anything about it. We raised it in the House week in and week out and that is why there is a vote of confidence in the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something rotten in the Department. When the beef barons receive almost £1 million from the Department, we are entitled to a few answers, although that speaks for itself. Since the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="94" /> O'Keeffe, took up office there have been crises in the beef, sheep and pig sectors. All we can do in Opposition is highlight the deficiencies of the Government. Deputy Connaughton is not the Minister and I am not the Minister of State, and it does not matter what we say. It is up to those in Agriculture House to introduce policies and whatever else is needed to deal with these problems. There were more people in the agriculture industry prior to Fianna Fáil taking up office, and that is why we had to table this motion.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that this issue was a defining moment for farmers. I met them on the picket lines at the Charleville and Rathkeale meat plants and participated in two special agricultural debates last week. It was important that farmers took a stand. The increase in the meat inspection levy, totalling £400 million, led to this dispute, but it is worth bearing in mind that the beef industry has a bad reputation. The problems evolved in the early 1990s following the report of the beef tribunal. It is easy to understand why it is widely perceived that a cartel operates within the industry when the three main players control 65% of it. Larry Goodman's company has 25% while Dawn Meats and Kepak have 20%. In the early 1990s there was a frantic rush to pass legislation through the House to save Larry Goodman's company after it incurred £500 million in debts in the Middle East, but last year it made £12 million profit on a turnover of £680 million. There is a perception that there is a political affiliation between the beef industry and Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The recent dispute was a defining moment for consumers. I was surprised by their appreciation of the prices paid to farmers for beef and the prices they pay for meat when they go to their local butchers. The Competition Authority set out to review the beef industry in 1997 and it was disappointing it did not successfully probe the cartel that exists. I wish the expert authority luck but I am concerned that it does not have a statutory foundation similar to the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not mind if he is transferred to another Department in tomorrow's reshuffle. He will accept, as I said to him last week at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that he has been in agriculture for a long time and knows the beef industry much better than many people, but unless he has the steel, mettle and determination to take on the industry, given that it is a formidable and powerful player, he should step aside and allow somebody else to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Government in order to ascertain whether a better deal can be obtained for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers will not accept a fall in prices again and I hope those which were agreed last week will be looked upon as the floor prices for the different grades of beef because I hate to think about the likely action that would result if prices <Col N="95" /> were to drop. Fine Gael and the Labour Party were right to table this motion because this issue should be addressed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great time for the Minister as he is a constituency colleague, but he has not got his ear to the ground in regard to the grassroots of the farming industry. He was active in Opposition and criticised the former Minister, Deputy Yates, when Ireland was hit by the scourge of the BSE crisis. He seemed to have all the answers then whereas now he seems to sit idly by. What is the status of the new farm retirement scheme? Farmers are completely mesmerised at the lack of detail. The Minister was well aware that a new scheme was due to come into operation on 1 January 2000, yet the application for same was not sent to Brussels until the first week of the month. I am amazed by the lack of speed in the Department. It has known for the past two years that the old scheme would conclude on 31 December 1999, yet it took all that time to send the information to Brussels for the new scheme. We have been told that the earliest date for the introduction of the scheme is 30 June, but an official in the Department informed me last week that it could be 30 September. Farmers who want to retire will have to wait nine months. There is no vision in the Department.</P>
      <P>Competition is the lifeblood of trade and I am astonished the Minister has not stood over the promise he made in the lovely document he circulated around our constituency prior to the last general election &ndash; Message from Fianna Fáil to the Farmers and Farm Families of Ireland &ndash; which had a picture of the Minister and the Taoiseach on the front. It stated:</P>
      <P>Confidence at home must be followed by sales abroad. Supporting our farm enterprises will be a political priority for the next Fianna Fáil Government. We will oversee a concerted political push to re-open foreign markets for the live trade.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach would have been better served if he stayed at home rather than going to South Africa and allowed the Minister to take the Government jet to Libya and Egypt to try to re-open their markets for the import of live cattle from Ireland. Without competition the factories will play hide and seek with farmers. I am surprised the Minister is doing nothing about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers were driven by sheer desperation to picket factories to highlight the injustice inflicted on them by the Minister who allowed meat processors to impose a further £1.80 slaughter fee on them, which amounted to £400 million. That was the last straw and it broke the camel's back. Meat factories were paying between 70p and 82p per pound. Necessity is the mother of invention. If the factories need cattle to fill their export and <Col N="96" /> home markets, they must be prepared to pay a realistic price to the producers, not 20p per pound less than that paid to English producers or 45p per pound less than that paid to French producers. Action speaks louder than words.</P>
    <P>The Minster is a nice man, but pious words butter no bread. The farming community is desperate and the Minister's message during the election campaign in June 1997 has not been heeded. The Minister has done nothing to establish what has been given to them. They voted for him and his Ministers of State, Deputies O'Keeffe and Davern, thinking they would be genuine but, alas, the Minister misled the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael tabled this motion because farmers have lost confidence in the Minister. They do not see him as someone fighting their corner. Many of them have lost heart. The resilience which was the hallmark of the Irish farmer has been destroyed. Farmers are deeply hurt. They have devoted their lives to agriculture like their fathers and grandfathers before them who had to fight and agitate for the right to own their land and not be rack-rented for improving it. This spirit is disappearing rapidly. At one time farmers cajoled their sons and daughters into staying on the land. Now in many cases they are doing the opposite. The implications for rural Ireland are frightening and unthinkable. Apathy, depression, demoralisation and an exodus from rural areas is now the order of the day.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sheehan said, the straw that broke the camel's back for sheep farmers was the introduction by the Minister of an additional levy of £1.85 on animals slaughtered which would obviously be passed on to the farmer. At a time when farmers need every financial support they can get, this was one of the most insensitive decisions ever made by a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. No doubt, during the Minister's 11 years in office he has had his moments. He introduced schemes the benefit of which I saw during my time in that office. However, Agenda 2000 will not go down as one of the Minister's great achievements. It is obvious that the Irish stood idly by and watched the sheep sector being decimated in those negotiations. It was not even considered. The Minister is familiar with the problem of butter fat which is relevant to my county. He had a marvellous opportunity to do something about that matter, but nothing was done.</P>
      <P> This debate is more than a motion of no confidence in the Minister. It is about the future of agriculture. I do not like to be personal in my remarks.</P>

      <P>As a person, the Minister is a nice man, but unfortunately for beef barons nice men do not produce the goods. I congratulate the IFA and the farmers. Many of those who supported the blockades had little or no involvement with the IFA for many years. They had lost faith in that organisation because of the Minister's failure to deliver.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that the workers needed to be compensated and I do not have a problem with that. I am glad they are at work this week, providing meat for foreign markets. If the Minister remains in office how does he intend to compensate farmers for the millions of pounds they have lost? It is clear from the negotiations the Minister started and the farmers finished there was an increase of £50 per head. Multiply that by the millions of cattle sold over the past two and a half years and we have some idea of the losses sustained by farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has appointed Professor Seamus Sheehy and others to look at the industry. I hope he does that job a little better than he did when he looked at the problems in Monaghan. All he did was read the literature provided. Although I asked him to visit the county and my parish, he did not do so and we know the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig industry has been mentioned. Pig farmers along the Border did not get compensation, they got a promise. I sat with one young man until 1.30 a.m. trying to see what he could gain, but there was no hope for him. The methods put forward to claim the paltry £1 million of the £5 million that was needed means that his family is doomed. There are 95 pig farmers in the Border regions. If the Taoiseach leaves the Minister in that office, he should try to get some device to pay the money. Pig and sheep farmers deserve the same kind of inquiry as the livestock sector and I hope the Minister will bring that to the <Col N="98" /> attention of the Tánaiste to ensure that cartel is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil backbenchers made out that the Minister is doing a good job and young farmers have total confidence in him. They have so much confidence that the agricultural college in my county, which was doing very well up to three months ago, is now closed. Other colleges are also closed and more will follow suit. Young farmers who are the future of this industry have lost confidence in it. Five hundred farmers crowded into the Riverdale Hotel in Ballybay, as they did in locations all over the country. I attended the meeting and have never witnessed such deafening silence or seen how frustrated and anxious they are about their future. Husbands and wives were present to see if it were possible to get through the morass of difficulties presented by Agenda 2000. When the Department officials were asked how it was intended to monitor it, they said the farmers' end was sorted out but not the rest. Agenda 2000 will go down in history as spelling the end of farmers who do not have sufficient education to deal with all the paperwork the Minister has forced on them.</P>
    <P> Small meat factories are being closed to make room for the barons. I ask the Minister to ensure that proper veterinary supervision is available to small factories as they provide a service to local industry as well as exporting pigs and cattle. He should ensure they are not screwed into the ground as is the case at present.</P>

      <P>On numerous occasions during the last session of the Dáil I raised the matter of poverty on small dry stock farms. That is on the record of the House. I told of the poverty and of children going to school in need. I saw Ministers and Government backbenchers sniggering when I made that statement. I repeated it on a number of occasions but no action was taken. We hear of a scheme of aid for small farmers. I referred to social welfare workers coming into the farm kitchen and counting the number of eggs on the dresser when assessing farm incomes, which is humiliating and degrading. Nothing was done for those people. The Minister stands guilty of that.</P>
      <P>Pig farmers from Mayo and other areas had to picket the Dáil when they should have been at home looking after their animals. On numerous occasions I raised the issue in this House. The Minister stands guilty. Pig farmers had to come from my constituency and other areas to picket the Dáil when they should have been on their farms looking after their animals. I raised this issue here on numerous occasions but it was not until I had the House adjourned in uproar, for which I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Minister decided something must be done and a package was put together. I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, talk about the package but to this day, not one penny of that package has reached those farmers, and they are desperate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> There is a more serious charge. On the six o'clock news last Monday evening, Philip Lynch, Chairman of An Bord Bia, paid glowing tribute to the quality of the Irish beef being exported to Europe. He stated clearly that in consumer tests carried out in supermarkets across Europe, Irish beef came out on top nine times out of ten for quality, texture and flavour. Nine times out of ten, Irish beef beat all other European beef placed in those supermarkets. In blind tests, where consumers volunteer to be blindfolded and sample the product, Irish beef came out on top. I believe Philip Lynch, the Chairman of An Bord Bia. I come from a farming background and I know we have good cattle, but contrast that statement with the statement from the beef barons who claim time and again that the quality of beef being produced here is not marketable. I would not like to use strong language and call them liars, but they are telling untruths. I believe Philip Lynch, not the people who are engaging in propaganda which allowed them to trample on the farmers while the Minister stood idly by. He did not challenge them. The Minister stands guilty.</P>
    <P>Many farmers with reasonably sized farms of 100, 150 and 200 acres are now tenants in their own farms. They are feeding cattle for the beef barons. We are back to the days of the landlord, and who is responsible for that? The Larry Goodmans and others who creamed off the money, bled the farmers and then took over the farms while the Minister and the Government stood idly by. The Minister and the Government had a duty to protect those people who were up against multi-millionaires who could not care less and who fixed their prices on a Monday morning. A cartel existed and out of sheer desperation those honest, decent people were driven to picket the beef factories. They got urban support for that because people realised, looking at the protesters on television, that these were honest, decent people seeking nothing less than to protect their livelihoods, provide for their families and save their farms, but the Government sat idly by. The farmers had to do the job themselves. Congratulations to the IFA.</P>
    <P>This problem has not been solved. Ninety pence has been offered but who will get the 90p? We will give you the birds of the forest but you can catch them yourself. I am open to contradiction but I understand there are now ten grades in respect of beef animals. Who will police this grading system? Will it be left to the beef barons or will there be independent grading? I do not wish the Minister any harm but we have lost confidence in him. The farmers have lost confidence in him. Whoever is in power should police the grading system and restore to farmers the confidence they are entitled to have in the beef industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister fuelled the blockade on the factories, then sat back and did nothing about it for five days. He has shown gross <Col N="100" /> incompetence in dealing with this problem and in dealing with the Competition Authority which has done nothing for the past three years. The Minister has not even requested information from the Competition Authority for the past three years and now, following the Cabinet meeting in Ballaghadereen, he has decided to set up an expert group to look into the cartels in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>Many of my colleagues have spoken about the problems in the beef industry but the Minister is not the only one to blame. His two colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Keeffe and Davern, are to blame also. They are the Ministers with responsibility for food and cattle breeding. Not only should the Minister resign, but he should bring his two colleagues with him. He has run farmers out of agriculture.

      <P>Deputy Connaughton will wrap up the debate on the Deputy's behalf. I want to wrap up the debate on the Government's behalf. The record of this House will show that while in Opposition, I set out the health and safety authority we should have, because of the need to ensure that health and food safety went to the top of our agenda as a result of the post-BSE situation that arose during the tenure of the previous Government. We stand over that, and the first decision taken by Government in June 1997 was to ensure that Authority was set up. Having worked with Deputy Joe Walsh as Minister, I can assure the House there were not any turf wars between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure that basic insistence on quality was achieved through the setting up of the Health and Safety Authority. It is an Authority which has been replicated in other countries in Europe because of the way we set it up and the balance it has introduced to ensure that the consumer focus on agricultural production is brought to the fore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that we produce nine times more than we export in beef. It is a volatile market. We sell to 60 countries and we want to add value. The live trade has been replaced in the main by a processing trade but the need for a live trade remains. We do not process our beef to the extent that we should. We have meat traders in the main rather than big processors, and we need to add value. We need to get into markets to attain higher margins so that producers can stay in the beef business. We all face that situation. The approach of Deputy Joe Walsh, as Minister, in every agriculture ministry he has held, and particularly in the senior ministry he now holds, has been one of partnership. We faced serious challenges on the Agenda 2000 negotiations but we approached those on the basis of partnership, and we succeeded. There are people representing farm families throughout the country, like Tom Parlon, who had the good grace to acknowledge the negotiating achievement of Deputy Walsh on the basis of the national interest being upheld. In relation to the way we implement the outcome of <Col N="102" /> Agenda 2000, he has put in place review groups and monitoring committees which allow the people in the industry to participate. More than anything else, this dispute has highlighted the need for everybody to be in possession of accurate information so that people can come to a common language. Let us be honest with people. Continued conflict in the beef industry will not bring better prices and will not ensure a better industry and maintain farm families on the land. It is only through partnership and co-operation that we will be able to identify those markets and insist on price transparency, the fundamental conclusion of the report of the beef task force set up by the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the fundamental issue. We have discussed the vagaries of the beef industry on an ongoing basis. Successive Ministers have made valiant attempts to improve the situation. There have been improvements, particularly when one considers that there is not a single kilogram of beef going into intervention, that we are selling what we produce to the market. The problem is that we are not selling to markets which are profitable enough, to the consumer in the European Union who has the disposable income to pay a higher price. It is difficult for us to do that because of the BSE problem and I do not minimise the problems which faced the then incumbent in dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>The role of the Opposition is to put forward the best interests of the State. I ask people to look at the debate which took place in this House when only the Minister and I, as spokesman, were present, when I spoke about the need to re-organise the Department, to focus on consumers and to ensure that Teagasc worked with farmers to ensure beef was of high quality. That was what we had to do and that is what we are doing. To suggest that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is the cause of the problems in the beef industry is so facile and idiotic that it insults the intelligence of those trying to earn a living from a beef industry with margins which are tighter than ever.</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh has made immense achievements. The response of the then incumbent to an alleged cartel was a Competition Authority investigation, a criminal investigation requiring very high standards of proof. That investigation is ongoing but that policy initiative does not get to the bottom of a perceived problem. We can get to the bottom of the perceived problem by acting on the report of the group set up by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, which will report by 1 April. Then we will see the anti-com<Col N="103" /> petitive practices. We must get to the bottom of this problem. No one holds the brief for the primary producer. Everyone with a head on his or her shoulder knows that a producer without a market becomes a non-producer and a marketeer without producers becomes a non-marketeer. We need co-operation. We must move beyond this dispute and learn from it.</P>
      <P>Farmers are entitled to the required price transparency. We must ensure that the beef processing industry, as is set out in the national development plan, becomes involved in marketing promotion and capital investment so that the industry is rationalised and can meet the demands of a sophisticated consumer market. If the beef industry follows the example of the dairy industry, an integrated industry feeding into a sophisticated consumer market with added value products which can compete with the best in the world, we will see a future for beef farmers and the beef industry.</P>
      <P>What is the easiest thing to do, the thing for which there will always be a ready ear? It is to talk about the limitations of the problem, about how difficult the situation has been. That will not solve the problem. We must work on a co-operative basis, the hallmark of this Minister's approach. The bigger picture demands that whatever difficulties exist in the industry at any given time &ndash; on successive occasions different Ministers have had difficulties with the sheep, pig, beef and dairy sectors &ndash; we must acknowledge that the Agenda 2000 task force reviews in relation to beef are the way forward. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has provided leadership and it is in the interests of everyone to have the recommendations implemented to ensure price transparency is achieved and get on with the business of rebuilding the beef industry.</P>

      <P>The House will permit me a wry smile when I think of the Minister for Health and Children, soon to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking about agriculture debates when he was Opposition spokesman because, while it is true that he put forward proposals for a food safety authority and other matters, he was not behind the door when it came to political opportunism in that job. He clearly tried to simplify issues to the culpability of the Minister for all the ills of BSE. It is rich to hear from him now how these debates should be conducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>As an office holder in Agriculture House, it is my opinion that a beef cartel in the <Col N="104" /> meat processing sector has existed and does exist. On two occasions in my experience, one with the DSP and the other with the top up premium, which were both hard won, the meat factories deliberately tried to collapse the price by 6p per lb to pocket some of the premiums to be paid directly for price drops. They aggregated with the price the money to be paid by the Minister. There was no market justification for that. They did so in a concerted fashion.</P>
      <P>They have not tried to convey the flat VAT refund to the primary producer. In any price league for O grade cattle there is such consistent uniformity that there is a clear-cut case to show there is a cartel in operation. It does not surprise me that the Competition Authority in undertaking its investigation will be light years behind the fleet-footedness of those operating in the meat processing industry. One only has to read the proceedings of the beef tribunal to know that these individuals do not leave their footprints in the sand. I am shocked, however, that the Competition Authority has been so ineffective in its operations to date.</P>
      <P>It is true that I brought a memorandum to Cabinet on the full recovery of the cost of the meat inspection fees. I was absolutely determined that the grossly ineffective rosters and costs of the meat inspection service would be radically re-organised. I heard of cases where slaughtering would finish at 3.15 p.m. and a new roster of veterinary staff would start at 3 p.m. and be paid a full day's pay. It was illogical, irrational and inefficient and cost an outrageous amount. My intention was to first reform the structure and then introduce one which could not be passed on. That would have meant that a different levy would be levelled on each meat factory, making it impossible to pass it on on a <i>pro rata</i> per animal rate.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the farmers won. The problem is that producing beef at 82p per lb is uneconomic, with the prevailing rate of special beef premiums the same across the 15 member states. That is the core issue. The Minister must go to Commissioner Fischler and tell him that our primary producers are not being protected and that we need to introduce a system of export refunds so that when a price is pre-fixed, it is based on a producer price. The meat processors play ducks and drakes with volumes to manoeuvre the price, but if they pre-fix at a given level set by the Beef Management Committee, that will be reflected in a basic minimum price to the producer. Then, and only then, should they be able to avail of the benefits of the export refund scheme. Those genuine meat processors who focused on the European supermarket shelves will then be rewarded but those who have gone for the commodity based approach will have to reflect the proper price which Europe would like to pay our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week's dispute was totally unnecessary. The meat processing factories inflicted an outrageous situation on their staff and their suppliers. They were penny wise and pound foolish. <Col N="105" /> I sincerely hope this has been a defining moment which will mark a shift in the balance of power between beef producers and beef processors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a unique record in recent agricultural politics. He has been Minister for or Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture for 11 of the past 13 years. During those years he has gained wide experience of the agriculture industry and I am sure the Minister feels confident of his brief. The problem with the Minister is that after 11 years in Agriculture House he has become complacent. Eleven years in the same Department has institutionalised him. His civil servants know him inside out and he knows what he should and should not do to make life comfortable for himself and his Department.</P>
      <P>So confident was the Minister in his ability to steer a steady, uninspiring and unconfrontational course for his Department's ship that he cleared the bridge, switched on the auto-pilot and retired to his cabin. What other reason can there be for the debacle of the past three weeks, a period in which we have seen our prime national industry stopped in its tracks, the main farming representative group rendered leaderless and thousands of rural people forced to protest in an act of sheer desperation? </P>
      <P>The spark that ignited this upheaval was the decision of the Minister and his Department to recoup the total meat inspection costs through the meat processing plants from the farming community. It has been widely acknowledged for many years that the meat inspection service needed overhaul. Major inefficiencies were pointed out as far back as 1995 in the Ernst and Young consultancy report carried out jointly for the industry and the Department. One of the most recent Government reports prepared by the former Secretary of the Department of Finance said that &ldquo;the meat inspection service was difficult to justify in its present form&rdquo;. Only days ago the Secretary General in the Department told the Committee of Public Accounts that the inspection service was high cost and rigid and that the Department was prepared to engage in discussions with the beef plants to increase the flexibility of the service. Was the Minister not aware that the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the Department's service was highly unsatisfactory before he made the decision to recoup all departmental costs? If the Minister was aware of the problems with the meat inspection service, did he not feel it would be prudent to implement immediate reform before looking at the refund of the cost?</P>
      <P>The Minister had no knowledge of the undercurrent of resentment and frustration swelling up among beef farmers. If the Minister had a proper grasp of the problems in his Department, never mind the problems of the beef industry at large, he would not have sleep-walked himself and the industry into the current mess.</P>

      <P>While listening to this debate I was amazed to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who represents a rural constituency, argue that this motion relating to the serious dispute between the beef farmers and meat factories is a waste of parliamentary time. Is agriculture of such little importance to the Government it is even impatient with a debate on the industry? Is it any wonder the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development did not appear to know of the frustration of beef farmers, that it took him three or four days to realise the seriousness of the protest and that he was unable to solve it.</P>
      <P>I will state three facts. The Minister caused the dispute by approving the increased veterinary charges which were passed on to farmers. The Minister allowed the dispute to escalate by his inaction at the initial stages and the Minister failed to resolve the impasse as farmers had to go home and negotiate with their local plants on their home ground.</P>
      <P>This dispute is an embarrassment to the Government. It should never have happened and it could have been avoided. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, should have listened to the farmers and farming organisations, read the <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i>and listened to Opposition politicians who warned him of the impending crisis in the beef industry. Many speakers on the Government side of the House have declared the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to be the best Minister for Agriculture ever. Yet, under his stewardship farm incomes have declined, young people refuse to consider farming as a career, more than 50% of farmers farm on a part-time basis and farmers are selling site after site to try to make ends meet. This is hardly a successful list.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown appallingly poor judgment and an incredible insensitivity to the plight of beef farmers. I regret that the future of farming is at risk under his stewardship. He may be Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but he is not Minister for farmers, and without farmers we have no agriculture industry. I am glad the farmers won but the victory is theirs alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has failed to deal with the crisis in agriculture. The Minister's decision to increase the inspection charges precipitated the crisis. He quickly backed off but he was too late. The frustration and discontent which was building up in the agricultural community found a medium of release. The media listened and reported and the circumstances in which the farmers found themselves received unprecedented public understanding and sympathy. The Minister tried to solve the problem by the presence of his authority at the negotiating table between the farmers and beef producers. He made regular announcements of imminent agreement and raised expectations, but failed dismally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> The beef producers attempted to break the farmers and the IFA with the strong arm of the law but they too failed dismally. Farmer solidarity was never more strong. Thousands of farmers came out on the picket lines in sympathy and solidarity with their farmer leaders who were forced to resign their positions to protect their organisation. A message should go out to those who set out to destroy the IFA that the organisation will not be destroyed.</P>
    <P>Farmers are under siege. People are leaving agriculture at a growing rate. Many farmers are forced to make their occupation secondary in the family income. The Minister must urgently examine the situation and ensure that agriculture is put back in its position as an important national industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this important debate. I ask the Government a question on behalf of 100,000 farmers who have beef cattle. Had farmers not blockaded the meat factories last week what price would they be getting for their beef today? They would be getting 82p per lb. They could not expect any more because that is what they were being paid before the dispute. Had they not blockaded, what would they be paying as meat inspection levy? They would be paying the increased price of £5.50 per annum. The Minister did not have hand, act or part in what happened and it is a mockery to try to persuade farmers that, in the 27 hours of negotiation in Agriculture House, he somehow settled the dispute. The Minister was pulled into the negotiations screaming. What else could a Minister for Agriculture do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy <Col N="108" /> Cowen, made an excellent contribution to the debate but I have been listening to what he said for years. Ministers talk a lot but they are unable to keep their promises. Half the beef producers in Ireland left the industry in the past five years. One cannot produce beef for sale at 82p per lb because that will not make a profit. That is why the farmers in the Ministers' constituencies have left.</P>
    <P>The problem is one of price, credibility and the profitability on the chain. How can processors expect to make a profit if the producers at the bottom of the chain are losing money? The problem also extends to the consumer. I agree with most of what the Ministers have said, but their actions do not support their words. They cannot do so because, for some historical reason, they have never been able to deal with the meat processors.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to propose this motion of no confidence. Everyone knows the Minister is very easy to deal with and this is to his eternal credit. However, one has to take notice of his record and it appears that the Department is running on auto-pilot. He does not have the flair to do what is needed. He has had almost 11 years to take the necessary action and we cannot hope he will take it in the next year or two. It is time for a change. Were it not for the solidarity farmers showed with each other, they would not be receiving 90p per lb for their beef. The Minister had no part in achieving that price for farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope we achieve the target of profitability, consumer demand for a product that meets their requirements and a good living for Irish farmers. Unfortunately, under the stewardship of the Minister, that is not happening.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Adjournment Debate." RHead="- Milk Quota">
    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Milk Quota.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed changes in the milk quota-super levy regime in Ireland relative to the transfer of milk quota and the clarification in relation to transactions due to be introduced on 1 April 2000 and the effects it will have on the livelihoods of the huge number of farmers concerned is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>The farmers concerned are compliant and tolerant people. However, they cannot stand idly by and watch their future being destroyed. They are very dependent on milk production for their livelihoods, whether as active or dormant producers. In 1983, producers with milk quota did not find themselves in this position by accident. It came about through years of hard work and dedication. Since 1983, milk quota has acquired asset status. It is both legally and morally wrong for this Government to force people to sell this asset, especially at a capped price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now outline the main points of contention. Private leasing should be allowed for the new farm retirement scheme, otherwise the scheme will prove futile. Those who are already participating in the scheme and who entered it in good faith now find themselves in a catch-22 situation when their lease expires. The rules have now changed so much to their disadvantage that they do not have any option other than to go the legal route. The restriction on land and quota sales, where it has to be operated as an independent going concern, should be removed. There should not be any enforced sale of quota which <Col N="113" /> has been recognised as an asset by the Revenue Commissioners in the past and has been treated as such for capital taxation purposes. This view has been reinforced recently by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is the view of quota holders that temporary leasing where milk is available at a realistic price is an important lifeline for both the small and medium producer and the lessor. People with a vested interest in the winding down of temporary leasing, for example, large producer groups, have recently stated that the scheme is illegal. This allegation does not stand up, nor does it comply with the view of independent experts who state that if the scheme is properly defended at EU level, it will be allowed to continue as long as the quota scheme lasts, provided we would otherwise manage our national quota properly. It would be in the national interest to defend temporary leasing at EU level and it would directly benefit more than 75% of our quota holders.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the scheme has served both the lessor and the lessee well. It allows for flexibility on the part of the lessor and the use of his or her own land, together with revenue generated from the quota, has proved attractive. The advantages of flexibility are that temporary leased quota can be financed from cash flow and does not involve borrowings, as would happen with the purchase of reallocation quota. As the users of temporary leasing, namely small producers, do not have a taxable income, a tax concession for the purchase of reallocation quota is not an advantage. The scheme created opportunities for the lessor to participate in off-farm employment, together with rent received and the use of his or her own land amounts to an attractive package. The result is that farmers have a sustainable income and, by implication, maintain rural populations.</P>
    <P>If temporary leasing is wound down and replaced by the sale and purchase of reallocation quota, this quota will end up with large producers because small producers lack the capacity to finance its purchase. As the quota system is unlikely to continue beyond 2006, many producers would be reluctant to purchase even if financially able to do so. It is a grave injustice and may be unconstitutional to force dormant quota holders to sell their quota, given that it is a capital asset which was created by them prior to 1983 and, as such, contributed to the national quota. The demand for such changes has not come from the current scheme participants who are dormant, small or medium producers. Rather, it has come from the large producer sector which raises obvious questions about its possible motives.</P>
    <P>The participants in a temporary leasing scheme want the scheme to remain in its current form. Collectively, these producers comprise 75% of all quota holders. Temporary leasing in its present form is ideally suited to dormant quota holders in cases of sickness or death as it allows farmers to continue to educate their children while at the same time providing an opportunity for a family member to return to milk production. If tempor<Col N="114" /> ary leasing were to be wound down, as is proposed, it would rapidly hasten the depopulation of rural Ireland. I cannot see the logic in outlining 31 clauses in the new changes in the milk quota-super levy regime in Ireland. They will only baffle the farmers further. Common sense should prevail and the new regime should be reorganised before being put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe):</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Sheehan has a worthwhile suggestion in this, I will be happy to examine it. The changes being made to the operation of the milk quota regime with effect from 1 April reflect concerns on the part of the Government for the livelihoods of Ireland's dairy farmers and the long-term future of the dairy sector. In the past, producers were often unable to expand their enterprises and realise the full potential they have to offer because of the uncertainty within the quota system and the unavailability and cost of additional quota.</P>
      <P>The changes being proposed for the management of the milk quota regime in Ireland are necessary if the dairy industry is to successfully position itself to face the competitive challenges which will emerge from the enlargement of the EU and the WTO negotiations. These have been decided after wide consultation.</P>
      <P>The measures to break the rigid link between land and quota in the transfer of quota are designed to give more flexibility and certainty to milk producers;  greater priority access to quota for small and medium scale producers; and more opportunity for competition in the milk production sector. These new arrangements will give active, committed producers greater access to quota over the coming years at a reasonable cost. The existing system of quota transfer linked to land meant, in many cases, that producers were required to take on additional land which they did not need for their farming operation in order to acquire extra quota. This imposed an additional cost and made it particularly difficult for small and medium scale producers to acquire quota.</P>
      <P>The option of temporary leasing quota was even more precarious in that it operated only until the end of each quota year and active producers could not rely on it to expand their dairy enterprises. I am aware that there is some concern among people who are no longer involved in milk production and whose quota has been leased into the temporary leasing pool on a continuous basis. I would like to clarify the position in relation to these people. It will no longer be possible for such quota holders to temporarily lease their milk quota where the quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years, 1997 to 1999, or for a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000 such quota holders will have the option to resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year or to sell the milk quota into the 2000 <Col N="115" /> milk quota restructuring scheme. In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>
    <P>The new milk restructuring scheme will allow for the sale of quota without land in a structured manner and in line with priority categories. This will help to reduce the cost of acquiring additional quota, with a consequent beneficial effect on production costs. My officials are now in the process of drawing up, together with the Office of the Attorney General, the necessary legislation to give effect to these changes and are consulting on an ongoing basis with the various players in the dairy industry to ensure the smooth introduction of the measures. I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this very important issue, which is topical at present. The Government is caring in its approach and is prepared to listen to suggestions. The milk industry is vital to the economy and to rural communities.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this important motion. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, for being present as he has a certain amount of responsibility in relation to the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>James Dillon who, as Minister for Agriculture, visited flood victims in 1954 to view the extent of flooding, told his officials to treat the people with dignity and respect and to err on the side of generosity. Dillon gave clearance to the local authority, with the approval of the Government, to appeal any legislation or regulation which created obstacles or hindered the alleviation of the suffering of the people at that time. This winter flooding was the same as in 1954. Some of the Minister's colleagues do not seem to realise it, but the water level at the Shannon weir in Athlone reached the level it reached in 1954 when the worst floods on record were experienced by the people in the Shannon basin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dumbfounded this evening by a response I received from the Minister in relation to compensation for farmers. The Minister stated: &ldquo;I have no plans for a special fodder compensation scheme&rdquo;. Will the Minister tell me how I can go back to my constituency, to my parish, and tell a farmer that all he has is his home with a foot of grass around it? His hay shed is under two feet of water. All his round bales of silage are gone. <Col N="116" /> His whole farm is gone and he has to lease land from his next door neighbour for his cattle. How am I to tell him he will not be compensated? He is only one of a small number of farmers who have been severely affected by flooding.</P>
    <P>Every year we see flooding in the Shannon basin. No one is amazed at that. What we are talking about is the extent of it this winter, not just over the Christmas period but last September when many farmers lost fodder. There is no case of flooding in the Shannon basin in the history of this State when the State did not compensate farmers. However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has this evening decided not to give compensation to farmers.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine received a response this evening, I believe from the Department of Finance, to the effect that there is no need for a Shannon authority. Will the Minister of State explain why, given that the ESB, the Office of Public Works, Dúchas, Bord na Móna, Roscommon County Council and four other local authorities, the Inland Waterways, Shannon Fisheries and Coillte have an element of involvement in relation to the water levels of the river Shannon, there is no need for a Shannon authority? The Office of Public Works has reneged on its responsibility to maintain the channel of the Shannon. It has carried out arterial drainage in the past. The Office of Public Works has been given credit for those works. However, it has let water flow into the Shannon without putting maintenance in place. There is a four-mile stretch of the river from Banagher to Meelick where silt, muck and dirt that has gone into the river over the years has to be cleaned up. No one will take responsibility for water levels on the Shannon, for maintaining gates on the Shannon, yet the Government is telling us that there is no need for a Shannon authority. There is a need for immediate funding to compensate farmers and for maintenance of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Regarding the level of the roads in the Shannon basin, two weeks ago an elderly man had to go to Portiuncula Hospital, but the ambulance could not get to him. He had to be taken out on a buckrake and two bales of hay. That is not acceptable in the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten. In regard to the Minister's reply to a Dáil question, there will be outrage that the Minister has refused point blank to compensate farmers for fodder lost in the recent extensive flooding that occurred in December last year and January this year throughout the Shannon catchment area. Many householders and rural dwellers also suffered losses and should also be paid compensation.</P>
      <P>This refusal by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to pay any compensation whatsoever will cause considerable anger among the farming community who have, through no fault of their own, again incurred extensive losses of fodder, damage to their property and homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> Flooding across the Shannonbridge area was three to four miles wide. It came right into the village of Shannonbridge. The gardens at the backs of the houses were flooded. Across the whole area of Offaly in the Shannon catchment area considerable losses were incurred by farmers. I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to request Teagasc to carry out a survey of the losses incurred and I am disappointed that not alone will he not have a survey carried out but he will not pay compensation.</P>
    <P>We need a River Shannon forum as a statutory authority with responsibility to monitor flooding, maintain the river channels and regulate water levels. There is a necessity also to provide funding to ensure that at least the channels are cleared. It would be a positive move if a certain amount of work were carried out. The reply today will cause considerable upset. I ask the Minister to undertake further examination of this matter at ministerial level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this matter and Deputy Enright for his contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and I are acutely aware of the inconvenience and distress caused by the recent flooding of the Shannon and elsewhere in areas such as south Galway, Donegal and Ennis. While many of these areas are subject to annual flooding, the recent problems have been exacerbated by unusually high levels of rainfall. According to the Meteorological Office, rainfall last month was twice the normal December average. In addition, there were particularly high levels of rainfall in September and October. These conditions contributed significantly to the flooding of the Shannon catchment area where, I understand, flooding levels were at their worst for 50 years. In Jamestown, on the upper Shannon, water levels have been recorded at a historic high level. I appreciate the damage, loss and inconvenience caused, particularly in relation to the flooding of property, the loss and marooning of animals and the disruption caused by a number of access routes being rendered impassable.</P>
      <P>The Government is keeping the situation under review and will, where necessary, bring forward appropriate measures. It is not helpful at this stage to discuss what measures might be considered other than to say that what both I and the Minister for Finance would like to see is clear evidence of increased co-operation on the part of those agencies which have interests in and responsibilities for various aspects of the river. However, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance, said today in reply to a parliamentary question, there are no immediate plans to introduce a compensation package in respect of those affected by the recent flooding along the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the Shannon is that there has been a consensus over a considerable <Col N="118" /> period of time that capital works to relieve flooding are not viable and there is no evidence to suggest that this position has changed. As no arterial drainage works were ever carried out on the river, my office has no maintenance responsibility for the river. However, I am conscious of the problems experienced in and around Athlone during the recent flooding and my office has been in contact with Westmeath County Council in this regard. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, visited the area and was in contact with me during the flooding.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the position in relation to the Shannon, my office is actively involved in addressing the flooding issue elsewhere in the country. The office has a statutory responsibility to maintain or complete arterial drainage works and will spend £7.5 million on it this year. An independent review, undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers and published last year, concluded that this work was very worthwhile, especially with regard to the relief of urban and town flooding. A further £7.5 million will be spent on the alleviation of flood problems in built up areas. These will involve the design and construction of urban flood relief schemes in Dunmanway, Cappaghmore, Carrick-on-Suir and Kilkenny and schemes will be advanced in Clonmel, Carlow and Waterford.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the Minister for Finance allocated £2.5 million in the budget for special works in south County Galway. A steering group has been set up to bring forward specific proposals aimed at alleviating the problem. The group is chaired by my office and includes representatives of Galway County Council, the IFA, the ICMSA and Dúchas. I strongly endorse the kind of co-operation being demonstrated here and I am confident it will result in measures to relieve the flooding which has the support of all interested parties.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 in excess of £600,000 has been paid out to 14 families who, following the particularly bad flooding in south County Galway in 1995, were relocated under the home relocation scheme. I assure Deputy Naughten of the Government's concern about the difficulties experienced by so many after the recent flooding and I reiterate the commitment made by the Minister for Finance to keep the situation under review and, where necessary, to bring forward appropriate measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Student nurses gathered outside the gates of Leinster House today to highlight <Col N="119" /> their grievance that they are the only undergraduates in the country who have to pay university fees, despite the fact that third level fees have been abolished since 1997. They were angry and frustrated that they have been denied equity and fairness and they are determined to seek justice. I support their claim.</P>
      <P>It is in the public interest that student nurses are provided with the highest possible level of education and training to enable them utilise their skills for the maximum benefit of patients under their care. It is only in recent years that the need to modernise and revitalise the training and education of student nurses has been addressed. The new diploma course was first introduced in Galway in 1994 and this model is now offered to up to 30 nursing schools nationally. The continuation degree course was introduced in 1998 in the NUI, Galway and since then, the students have had to pay the fees for this course.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that nursing students must pay fees for their degree courses, unlike every other third level undergraduate. For too long the area of responsibility has been kicked back and forth between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. Neither has been willing to take responsibility for this injustice. It is unacceptable that these nursing students, mainly female, are being victimised and penalised while all other university students avail of free education. The Government is treating student nurses in a sexist manner. It is another example of its discrimination against young women and the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>Some 107 nurses were registered for the Bachelor of Nursing Degree at NUI, Galway, at a cost of £2,317 each in terms of course fees. Between 40 and 60 students have refused to pay this unfair and unjust demand. This situation is not of the college authorities' making. As the closing date for the payment of fees, 17 January, has expired, it is unfortunate that the talks between the representatives of the student nurses, SIPTU, and the Department of Health and Children officials have not yet found a solution.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to push young people into debt? Why can they not receive the same benefits available to every other student nationally? It is time to stop interdepartmental games. The imposition of these fees amounts to an unjust financial penalty on young people. Student nurses must have their fees paid. Their wish to continue their studies to degree course standard is being denied. If this is his last day as Minister for Health and Children, it would be a magnanimous gesture for the Minister to finally decide to pay these fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with other Deputies who said the issue on which the student nurses protested outside the gates of Leinster House needs to be urgently resolved. Time is of the essence. The date for registration is passed and <Col N="120" /> technically some student nurses who protested this afternoon could have the services of the different colleges with which they wish to register withdrawn or refused to them because they have not paid their fees. The situation is outrageous. I and the Labour Party and the Union of Students in Ireland, SIPTU and many other members of the public support their very reasonable demand.</P>
      <P>Student nurses are volunteering for a profession that is in grave shortage of skilled people. One cannot question the vocational motivation of those who have decided to choose nursing as a career. Such people are not in the same position as those who, say, volunteer for an MBA and who would afterwards seek to sell their services in the private sector, financial services or whatever. They are committed to nursing and the degree qualification they seek does not cover a range of subjects, but is specifically related to the vocational practice they have chosen. The public, therefore, benefits from their choice, their work and their qualification.</P>
      <P>The fee of £2,317 per annum can only be understood in the context of people who, if their remuneration is averaged over a year, will only get between £60 and £65 per week. It has been suggested by those who consider this subject in bureaucratic terms that the student nurses are being maintained by the health boards. They only maintain those who are in permanent full-time employment for more than three years. Given this, the student nurses are in an anomalous relationship to every other student who has benefited from the abolition of fees. Many other students from the same parish will also be in receipt of a maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The recent nurses' dispute was complicated, but it gave people an opportunity to appreciate what happens within hospitals, the different levels of responsibility in nursing and how nursing has so radically changed. It is clear from this that we need more nurses in better conditions and with better remuneration. Most importantly, we need better morale. The present situation is damaging to morale, especially that of younger people. At a time when so many people are choosing, and are under pressure to choose, individual careers that will remunerate them and give them very high future income, it is important to appreciate that people are opting for the public service. I applaud that. I was in hospital recently and it was wonderful to see the dedication of these younger people who, acting out of character from the prevailing culture of individualism, are choosing to serve in such a dedicated way.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous to suggest this matter cannot be resolved. It is possible for the Department of Education and Science to pay the college and to seek a complete refund from the Department of Health and Children. I was a Minister and I am aware of numerous examples of how an allocation from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Education and Science could be ringfenced to ensure there are no knock-on effects on the funding of other degree courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> Deputy Burke mentioned the equality dimension to this matter. It is most welcome that there are young men now volunteering for nursing but it is still overwhelmingly a female labour service. For all of these reasons I appeal to the outgoing Minister and the incoming Minister, whoever that may be, to simply resolve this issue equitably soon. It is worse for people to let this linger and do even further damage to morale that is already in short supply in so many places in a very important profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State is here with good news for us. He is aware, as we are, that there are up to 100 degree course nurses protesting outside the gates of Leinster House today. They have a legitimate complaint. The Government got away with this for the past two years. A degree course was set up in University College Galway three years ago whereby nurses who had completed the three year diploma course could then go on to obtain a nursing degree by a further year of study in University College Galway. On the surface this might seem all right, and similar to the position of other students who had completed their diploma course in a college of technology. The only difference is that the nursing student is being charged £2,317 in college fees for the privilege of the one year course while all other degree students are exempt from this fee and if living 15 miles away, they may also qualify for a maintenance grant as well.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised to ask the Minister to correct this serious anomaly and discrimination against people doing a degree in nursing. For the first three years of training, student nurses on the wards earn about £60 a week which is less than the unemployment assistance rate. This does not even cover their accommodation and living expenses, so how can they afford £2,317 for the degree course? I appeal to the Minister to give them fair play and abolish the third level fees for all third level students. If this is done it will enable the nurses completing their training to have the choice of continuing to do the degree year and the option will not be prohibited by the cost of fees. About 1,000 people are undertaking the nursing diploma programme every year but only about 100 of them are going on to the degree course. This £2,317 fee should be abolished to give everybody fair play and eliminate this anomaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Burke, Higgins and McCormack for raising this matter. There are two nursing degree courses on offer at the National University of Ireland, Galway: a one academic year course and a part-time course that can be undertaken over 18 or 24 months. Following the Government meeting in Ballaghaderreen last week, the Taoiseach and my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, met a delegation of nursing students wishing to undertake the former course, who are seeking to <Col N="122" /> have their fees paid. In response to representations made by the students, Deputy Cowen undertook to ask his officials to investigate whether anything could be done for them. The students concerned have successfully completed the three year nursing diploma programme and are entitled to register as nurses with An Bord Altranais. While undertaking the diploma programme, their third level fees were paid by the relevant health agency and they also received an annual non-means tested maintenance grant and other supports. The difficulty with the one academic year degree course is that it is outside the scope of the funding arrangements agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of pre-registration nursing education.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Nursing has recommended that no third level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the academic year 2002-03. Since a degree in nursing is not at present a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, it is regarded as an optional post-registration qualification.</P>

      <P>It is, however, open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Most health agencies have a continuing nursing education budget and the funding from this budget is used to help nurses wishing to undertake further education. The Department of Health and Children has given further consideration to the position of the Galway students wishing to undertake the one academic year degree course. Unfortunately, it is simply not possible to ringfence any arrangements for these students.</P>

      <P>There are currently some 3,100 nursing students participating in the nursing diploma programmes at various third level institutions around the country, and it is expected that there will be an additional 1,500 students next autumn. It would be inequitable to meet the fees of the students who have enrolled for the degree course being provided by NUI Galway but not make similar provisions for all the other nursing students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concession being sought by the Galway students, if granted, would also give rise to a legit<Col N="123" /> imate expectation on the part of registered nurses undertaking degree and other courses on a part-time basis that they should also have their fees paid in full. It is important to remember that there are currently in the region of 1,000 nurses undertaking such courses. A further factor that must be taken into account is the importance of the newly qualified nurses who have successfully completed three year nursing diploma programmes, entering the workforce as soon as they are registered. If students were to delay their entry by a further year in order to undertake a degree course on a full-time basis, then this would exacerbate the difficulties that some hospitals are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>

      <P>In all the circumstances, and having regard to the wider financial and other implications involved, the Department is not in a posi<Col N="124" /> tion to meet the fees of those students wishing to undertake the degree course at NUI Galway. We are, however, anxious to ensure that flexible arrangements are in place so as to afford some choice to these students. The degree course in question is structured in such a way as to allow the students to undertake part-time nursing work. The Department understands from the Western Health Board that some of the students who did the course last year worked an average of 20-24 hours per week and earned between £150 and £300 per week. It further understands from the health board that part-time work can be offered to this year's students on a similarly flexible basis so as not to interfere with their attendance at the university. As has been said already, the Minister is looking for other ways around the problem but that is the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 32, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attended the inaugural summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in London on Friday, 17 December last. I was accompanied by my colleagues, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Prime Minister and I welcomed the establishment of the British-Irish Council which will enhance the excellent working relationship that our two Governments have long enjoyed. The council is particularly relevant in the context of the extensive devolution which has taken place in the UK and will allow us develop stronger links with the recently devolved administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh.  I am circulating with my reply to the Deputies the communiqué which issued after the meeting.</P>
      <P>At the meeting we agreed a number of issues for early consideration by the council, including drugs, social inclusion, the environment, transport and the knowledge economy. These are issues of particular importance and concern and I look forward to the benefits that this kind of co-operation will bring.  We also agreed an indicative list of other issues which would be appropriate to the council's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same day, I attended the inaugural meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in 10 Downing Street. The same <Col N="127" /> Ministers who attended the BIC accompanied me.</P>
    <P>The conference will play an important role in promoting bilateral co-operation across the totality of relationships but with a strong focus on non-devolved Northern Ireland matters. At the meeting we agreed a programme of work around two initial lists of issues which are set out in a communiqué that I am circulating with my reply to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Regarding my recent meeting with the British Prime Minister in Helsinki, I would refer Deputies to my statement to this House on 15 December.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we have now achieved the implementation of the institutional aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. The new executive in Northern Ireland is a significant achievement and the North-South Ministerial Council an important milestone in our island's history, but there are still many challenges ahead as we seek to give full effect to the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcomed the statement made last week in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, on the implementation of the Patten report. The Government has always maintained that early and effective implementation of the report's recommendations would form an essential aspect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole. In this regard, it is very encouraging that the British Government has accepted and is to act on the great majority of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are those who have difficulties with some of the changes being proposed, but what we have now is a unique opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland.  The measures announced by the Secretary of State last week when completed satisfactorily through legislation will ensure that there will be a police service which is capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole and I would hope that Nationalists will then apply in great numbers to join the new Police Service of Northern Ireland. I look forward to seeing a detailed implementation plan emerge over the coming weeks and early publication of the necessary legislation, which must be fully in line with the thrust and spirit of the Patten recommendations.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I look forward to the publication shortly of the next report of the International Commission on Decommissioning. Decommissioning is an essential component of the Good Friday Agreement and it is clearly necessary that the international commission be in a position to report progress on the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, as envisaged in the outcome of the Mitchell review.  </P>
    <P>I continue to maintain contact with the British Prime Minister and parties in Northern Ireland and last Thursday, 20 January, I met with the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble. We had a use<Col N="128" /> ful discussion on matters relating to the Patten report and decommissioning.</P>
    <P>There are no current plans for me to visit Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although plans are at a tentative stage, I can confirm that I will be visiting Australia and the United States in the week around St. Patrick's Day this year. My Department is at present engaged in advancing the necessary arrangements and in putting together an itinerary for the visits in close association with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassies concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to progress in implementing the Agreement, I am circulating with my reply to the Deputies a communiqué issued on Monday, following the first meeting of the NSMC in sectoral format, dealing with the Trade and Business Development Body. In addition, meetings in the following sectoral formats are envisaged over the next three and a half weeks: education, health, the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and special EU programmes. A schedule of further sectoral ministerial council meetings is being prepared and it is expected that a first Council meeting in all the sectoral formats agreed to date will have taken place by March, and that they would meet quarterly thereafter. A first meeting of the Council in institutional format is envisaged for March.</P>
    <P>There is a momentum in the implementation of the Agreement which we all want to see sustained across all aspects of the Agreement, in line with the wishes of the people. It is important to maintain this momentum and it is for all participants in the Agreement to ensure this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In my statement of 16 December last, I detailed the arrangements proposed for inquiring into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outgoing Chief Justice has agreed to conduct an examination and assessment of all aspects <Col N="129" /> of the bombings and their sequel. The terms of reference remain to be defined precisely following consultations, including with the Chief Justice and relevant groups of relatives. The Chief Justice will commence his examination on 31 January. The duration of the examination will clearly be related to the amount of material to be reviewed. However, the Government envisages, and believes it would be very desirable, particularly from the standpoint of the relatives concerned, that the Chief Justice's report should be available for consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights when it recommences its activity after the summer break, next September. We will, of course, await the Chief Justice's assessment of the volume of the task and his proposals as regards the timing for the completion of the report.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice will conduct his examination in offices in Government Buildings. He has requested that he be provided with research and other staff and arrangements are being made in that regard. However, the Chief Justice has indicated that he will not be able to give a precise estimate of the resources he will need to carry out his work until he assesses the volume of his task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 to 39, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would initially like to clarify my role in relation to the National Archives Act, 1986, and, in particular, in relation to the transfer and withholding of files due for transfer from my Depart<Col N="130" /> ment to the National Archives. Such powers as are specifically conferred upon me as Taoiseach by the Act are contained in section 8(11) and section 11.</P>
    <P>Section 8(11) allows me to prescribe by order a particular named class or classes of records which are to be withheld under section 8(4). This provision is designed simply to save the laborious task of individually certifying all records of a particular class where each and every one is required to be withheld for identical reasons. The decision to actually withhold the files is made by the designated officer as defined in section 8 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows me to direct that records which have been withheld under section 8(4) be released for public inspection. I have not exercised this power to date.</P>
    <P>Any other powers conferred on me under the Act were transferred to the Minister responsible for arts and culture by the Arts and Culture (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1993.</P>
    <P>The total number of files or part files of my Department which have been withheld under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act is 573. As these files are generally of a sensitive or personal nature, it would not be possible to list these without indicating the contents. The decisions to withhold those files are of course subject to review every five years, under section 8(6) of the Act.</P>
    <P>The number of files, including file parts, relating to 1969 which were passed to the National Archives in 1999 amounted to 112. An earlier transfer of 969 files, covering a span of dates from 1965 to 1969, took place in February 1996. In total therefore, almost 1,100 files covering the period 1965-69 were transferred, the vast majority of which were made available for public inspection. Only 40 of these files or file parts were withheld under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act. The overwhelming reasons for files being withheld were privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Under the Archives Act, the National Archives and the National Archives Advisory Council are two separate bodies. It is the National Archives that receives records from Government Departments and makes them available for public inspection. The statutory role of the National Archives Advisory Council is to advise the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on all matters affecting archives and their use by the public and includes any matters relating to the National Archives. Therefore, while officials in my Department liaise on a regular basis with staff of the National Archives, including the director, who regularly attends meetings of the council, there has been no direct contact between my Department and the National Archives Advisory Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 to 50, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met each of the pillars in early December to hear, at first hand, their priorities and concerns, particularly in the context of the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are proceeding intensively at present. While, obviously, it would be inappropriate to go into any detail at this delicate stage, I can say that all sides continue to make strenuous efforts to move the process towards ultimate agreement. It is my hope that we will be in a position to conclude successfully in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>Given that possibility, it therefore would not be feasible to seek to widen representation at this stage. However, all the major issues and concerns facing society will feature in any new agreement and, therefore, it will be as inclusive as possible of all interests and perspectives.</P>
      <P>The final NESC strategy indicates very clearly the potential breadth and depth of a new agreement and, certainly, the Government is committed to the strategy as the general underpinning framework. I might make the general point that the strategy represents a compromise view between all the NESC members on a huge variety of issues and concerns and, as such, I am somewhat reluctant to comment on any specific view.</P>
      <P>As a principle, the Government is positively disposed to making society, including the policy and decision-making processes, as open and transparent as possible. Much progress has been made in recent years but, no doubt, there will always be scope for further improvement.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the Irish Farmers Association, I can assure the House that the association will continue to play its full role in the negotiations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> A working group on the implementation of the recommendations of the Nally group report commenced work in November 1999. The group comprises representatives from the Office of the DPP, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office. It is considering the staffing levels and structures necessary in an enhanced prosecution service. I understand that considerable progress has been made but I am not yet in a position to set out any new arrangements. The staffing and grading issues in the Chief State Solicitor's office are being considered in parallel with proposals for the staffing and grading of the new Office of Solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Regular discussions with staff side representatives have taken place and are continuing both in relation to internal CSSO matters and on the implications of the Nally group recommendations.</P>
    <P>I understand that steps have been taken by the CSSO to address the workload problems in some sections. The numbers at recruitment level in professional and technical grades have been increased by five over the past six months. Furthermore, additional promotional posts have been created to provide a more attractive career structure for new staff. Also, counsel are being engaged in some larger cases to prepare books of evidence.</P>
    <P>The industrial action is creating general inconvenience and is slowing down the preparation of cases for court. At this stage, I would prefer not to comment further.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the Information Society Commission's business community survey were published in December last. Overall, the results suggest that Irish businesses are making strong moves to embrace information and communication technology and are more engaged in e-business. While businesses now have a very positive attitude to e-commerce, actual levels are still relatively low. It is also apparent that small and medium enterprises, in particular, need to do more to keep up with technological changes in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main findings of the survey are that the vast majority of Irish businesses are now familiar with the terms and services relating to new technology; one third of Irish businesses have more than 75% of their employees using computers; Internet access in the business community compares competitively with the UK, Germany, <Col N="137" /> France, Italy, the USA, Canada and Japan; use of websites for on-line sales by Irish businesses is still relatively low; Irish businesses are more enthusiastic about the information society than their international counterparts; businesses are concerned about IT skills shortages but need to do more to provide training for their staff; and small and medium enterprises are more at risk of being left behind in the e-economy.</P>
    <P>Some of these findings have been confirmed by other studies carried out recently, including one by Andersen Consulting, entitled eIreland Takes Off. The findings relating to SMEs are a cause for concern. A range of awareness measures have been put in place, including a national awareness campaign for SMEs run by the commission with IBEC, which involves a series of seminars around the country with the objective of demonstrating the importance of e-commerce to SMEs. Enterprise Ireland has also enhanced the services it offers to SMEs in the e-commerce and information society area.</P>
    <P>Turning to the fasttrack to information technology initiative, the Information Society Commission has no direct involvement in this scheme, though it did welcome it in its most recent annual report, saying that it provides a model which can be applied to other sectors and other regions.</P>
    <P>The fasttrack to information technology initiative, also known as FIT, aims to provide training and employment in the IT industry for 3,500 people in the Dublin area over three years. The scheme, aimed primarily at the long-term unemployed, is being driven by the IT industry itself, which is assisting in a number of ways, including the development of training curriculums, providing internships, contributing to operating costs and, ultimately, providing jobs and career development paths for the trainees.</P>
    <P>I announced this scheme in March of last year. Since then, over 700 people have entered training courses, which are being provided by FÁS and the vocational education committees. More recently, around 60 people have moved on from training into full-time jobs, and the scheme is on target to meet the original first year projection of 900 trainees.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks a formal board of the FIT organisation was established. Many senior industry people are on this board, and representatives of the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment will shortly join them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 7 December, the National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past year.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, a training programme for the development of partnership in the public sector workplace was launched. The programme is called Working Together. The programme is designed to help managers, trade union representatives and employees to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop a partnership approach at the level of the workplace.</P>
      <P>The training programme is of use to trainers-facilitators who are working with partnership groups, especially with groups that are getting started. The programme is available without charge from the NCP through attendance at half day briefings on the materials and their usage. To date approximately 100 organisations have attended these briefings.</P>
      <P>For the private sector, a 13 module joint partnership training programme together with a supporting 25 minute video, was launched by me in Dublin Castle on 14 July last. This programme was developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a very substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership.</P>
      <P>A business plan which has been approved by the board of the centre for the joint delivery of this programme is being implemented at present. The business plan sets out clear parameters for joint delivery of this programme, together with a monitoring system to measure progress.</P>
      <P>The programme is still at a pilot stage and is co-ordinated by a steering committee comprising senior representatives from IBEC, ICTU and the NCP. This committee meets regularly to review progress against agreed objectives set out in the business plan. The steering committee reports progress to the liaison group and board of the centre. There is a provision in the business plan for an independent evaluation to review the overall effectiveness of the public and in-company pilot phase of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> As I have previously mentioned, in addition to the ongoing work of the NCP, an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is currently under way in my Department. It is expected that the consultants engaged to carry out this evaluation will submit their report soon. This will form a useful backdrop and context to assist the ongoing post Partnership-2000 discussions. The timescale for publication of the report and the manner of dissemination will be informed by this process.</P>

      <P>The National Millennium Committee was set up to advise the Government on projects for inclusion in its millennium programme. A total fund of £30 million was allocated to this programme, covering the years 1999 and 2000. Following a national advertising campaign, over 2,000 proposals have been submitted to the committee for consideration. Over the past 12 months the committee has considered the proposals received and has made recommendations on projects to the Government on a regular basis. The recommendations of the committee reflect particular themes, for example, children, youth and the elderly, the environment and the celebration of Christianity. In addition the committee has also endeavoured to ensure a wide geographic spread of projects.</P>
      <P>To date the millennium committee has made recommendations on projects amounting to nearly £29 million. This figure includes £3 million for 193 locally based projects around the country under the millennium recognition awards, an initiative administered by Area Development Management Limited. It also includes £3 million for 1,959 millennium events awards, administered by local authorities. To date just over £6.4 million has been drawn down in respect of the millennium programme.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee is supported by a small millennium office, the operational budget of which is included in the overall millennium fund.</P>
      <P>At this stage millennium funding is virtually fully committed. The National Millennium Committee is now in the process of finalising consideration of outstanding projects with a view to allocating the remaining funds available. The committee is approaching this final task with due regard to ensuring a broad thematic and geographic spread, consistent with its previous recommendations to the Government.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to address the quality of drinking water supplies in group water schemes following the recent decision by the European Commission to initiate legal proceedings against the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office I have increased the annual level of investment in rural water supplies by over 450%. Last year some £39 million was spent compared to the £8.5 million in 1996. As a further measure of the Government's commitment to resolving water quality and related difficulties confronting the group water sector, a record £420 million is being provided in the National Development Plan, 2000&ndash;06 for a vigorous rural water programme.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the extent of the quality problems in group water schemes, particularly those using private sources, and have never made any attempt to minimise them. By and large these schemes, which supply some 50,000 households nationally, lack any form of water treatment or disinfection. This is at the heart of the problem and is the focus of the extensive measures I have initiated to help bring groups into compliance with drinking water standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1998 I set up the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, representing the group scheme sector, the rural organisations, the local authorities and my own Department, to advise me on the policies needed to bring rural water supplies up to a satisfactory standard and to oversee the implementation of these policies by local authorities. Based on the plan of action subsequently drawn up by the committee, comprehensive county level strategies are now being developed to tackle the quality issue. These involve detailed examinations of all rural water supply systems, identifying the need for appropri<Col N="143" /> ate upgrading and renewal works, prioritising objectives and optimising the use of public and private water infrastructure to give the best service to rural consumers. In tandem with the county plans, new water treatment technologies are being piloted in group schemes at some 30 locations. These pilot projects are expected to show the way forward for group schemes to deal with water quality problems.</P>
    <P>The Government has set as a clear objective its intention to tackle, once and for all, the difficult and complex task of improving rural water supplies through an agreed strategy between the main stakeholders, properly researched and planned infrastructure measures and, most importantly of all, adequate financial resources to cover the necessary investment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that, against the background of the enormous and genuine efforts being made on the ground to improve the quality and efficiency of rural water supplies, the Commission should now be contemplating court action against Ireland. The Commission itself acknowledges that the Government is moving in the right direction after what it describes as &ldquo;years of neglect&rdquo;. This is an extensive problem, involving complex issues, including the issue of private ownership of group infrastructure, which cannot be resolved overnight.</P>

      <P>The community warden service which I propose to establish will focus generally on improving liaison between the local authority and the community, particularly on enhancing the environment through better enforcement of a range of regulatory functions for which the local authority is responsible. It is also proposed that it will have duties in relation to traffic and litter management.</P>
      <P>I have decided that the best way to progress the proposal is to pilot the service in a small number of authorities with a mix of urban and rural responsibilities. To this end, I am currently securing the commitment of selected authorities to the pilot service. They will then be required to put representative and expert task forces in place to develop detailed pilot implementation proposals.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the pilots will commence in the latter part of this year and will operate for a period of three years, whereupon they will be evaluated before deciding on wider introduction of the service.</P>

      <P>In the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework 1994-99, it was agreed at the request of the European Commission that a study of road pricing and related issues should be carried out with reference to the Dublin area. This study, which was conducted by a consortium of consultants led by Oscar Faber Group was published on 5 October 1999. A copy of the report on the study is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the study were to consider progress to date in implementing the non-infrastructure measures proposed in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative; overview the application of economic instruments, in particular those related to road pricing, in the context of other comparable cities; and assess the advantages and disadvantages of using economic and other non-infrastructure policies, in particular road pricing, in the management of traffic in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The study is a preliminary review of the potential for introducing new transport demand management measures in Dublin. The consultants conclude that road pricing could have a role to play in transport policy for Dublin; however, they also consider that the issue requires more detailed consideration in the context of an integrated approach to Dublin's transport requirements and that any future pricing initiative is likely to require balancing by a range of other measures.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has been asked to consider the study, in the context of the wider update of the DTI strategy now being finalised by it, and as an initial step has invited public comments and submissions in relation to it.</P>

      <P>My Department met last year with the Conference of Religious in Ireland, the representative body of the Church of Ireland and the Irish Episcopal Conference regarding land or property surplus to these bodies' requirements and which could be converted <Col N="145" /> to residential use or development. This initiative was undertaken in the context of the need to increase housing supply, particularly the utilisation of serviced development land in central locations. The purpose of the meetings was to make an estimate of how much surplus land or property might be available and to achieve an understanding that such land would first be offered to the relevant local authority on terms agreeable to both parties.</P>
      <P>All of the religious bodies were supportive of releasing any surplus land or property for social and affordable housing projects at agreed terms and gave an undertaking to carry out a survey within their organisations of the lands which may be available. The general view of all the bodies, however, was that there was unlikely to be a substantial amount of surplus land or property available in the near future.</P>
      <P>A reply was received from the Conference of Religious in Ireland this month which indicates that the amount of land likely to become available in the near future is small, with only five instances of available land or property being identified. In these cases the religious orders concerned are willing to enter negotiations with the relevant local authority or have already made arrangements with local authorities or voluntary housing bodies regarding the disposal of the land for social and affordable housing. Replies from the representative body of the Church of Ireland and the Irish Episcopal Conference are still awaited.</P>

Roimhe seo reachtáladh vótaíocht gach lá ó Mháirt go Satharn, gan aon treocht inaithinte ó lá go lá i líon méadaithe vótálaithe. Sula ndéanfaí vótaíocht a aistriú go dtí an deireadh seachtaine, bheadh machnamh aireach de dhíth ar réimse cúrsaí, ina measc iomaíocht le himeachtaí spóirt; deacrachtaí teacht ar fhoireann toghcháin; méadú ar na costais fhoirne; an líon mór daoine a bhíonn ag obair sa tionscail séirbhíse ag an deireadh seachtaine anois; daoine a bheith as baile; agus deacrachtaí ar chúiseanna reiligiúin.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 544 and 578 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has indicated its commitment to developing the public-private partnership approach as a major instrument in the future development and provision of infrastructure. In the case of water and sewerage schemes, local authorities are required to assess the suitability of all projects for possible use of design-build or design-build-operate contracts. Local authorities are also encouraged to group smaller projects for procurement purposes to facilitate the PPP option and as a means of reducing design, planning and tendering costs. Decisions on the method of funding and procuring of schemes continue to be made on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Thomastown sewerage scheme, my Department requested Kilkenny County Council to consider the feasibility of grouping the project with other schemes so that possible alternative procurement options could be explored. The council has recently submitted a response to my Department indicating that it favours proceeding with the scheme by the traditional procurement route. This response is at present under examination and my Department will be in touch with the council in the near future. The scheme is included in the water services investment programme to be advanced through planning and its status in the programme is not affected by the current correspondence.</P>
      <P>Contract documents for the Graiguenamanagh sewerage scheme, on a traditional procurement contract basis, have been approved, and the scheme will be advanced to construction on that basis.</P>
      <P>A revised preliminary report for the Kilmacow sewerage scheme is awaited from the council and consideration will be given to the most appropriate procurement method when this is received.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 99, 138, and 595 together.</P>
      <P>Infringement proceedings have been notified by the European Commission in respect of environmental directives affecting certain policy areas within my Department's remit.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, proceedings have been initiated before the European Court of Justice in respect of failure to implement Directive 97/68/EC concerning emissions of pollutants from engines in non-road mobile machinery. My colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Dan Wallace, made the European Communities (Control of Emissions of Gaseous and Particulate Pollutants from Non-Road Mobile Machinery) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 396 of 1999) on 14 December 1999. These fully transpose the directive into Irish law and I expect they will enable the court proceedings to be concluded without further action.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Commission has initiated court proceedings in respect of failure to implement Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended, on waste, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, with regard to the making of waste management plans. Ireland was originally given until 13 January 2000 to lodge a defence. The Attorney General's office has, with the support of the Commission, formally requested an extension of time which would allow the now advanced waste management planning process to be fully completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> A press release by the European Commission on 11 January, 2000 indicated its intention to initiate court proceedings relating to two directives; formal notification of these proceedings has not yet been received in my Department. The first of these concerns drinking water quality problems associated with private group water schemes and the adequacy of national regulations, having regard to the requirements of Directive 80/778/EEC. I refer the Deputies to the reply to Question No. 77 on today's Order Paper in which I have outlined the extensive programme under way, and substantial funding in place, to resolve quality problems in rural water supplies.</P>
    <P>The second relates to the incomplete transposition of Article 7 of Directive 87/217 EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos. This is now the responsibility of the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that regulations to complete the implementation of Article 7 of the directive are currently being examined by the Office of the Attorney General. The regulations have been prepared by the Health and Safety Authority and it is anticipated that, when made, they will fully address the Commission's concerns in this case.</P>
    <P>Proceedings at an earlier stage, by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union, have been notified to Ireland by the Commission in relation to specific issues arising under Directive 76/464/EEC on the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances, Directive 75/442/EC, and amendments, on compliance with waste legislation and Directive 91/692/EEC on the submission of reports on the implementation of water directives. A reply has issued in each case and the Commission response is awaited.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the construction industry has the capacity to meet the construction needs set out in the national development plan particularly having regard to the concerns expressed in the document entitled Framework for Action on Infrastructural Development including Public and Private Partnership; the action, if any, being taken to expand the construction sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1576/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the construction industry has shown remarkable capacity to meet demand, having doubled output since 1994. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that the construction industry may now be operating at or close to existing building capacity; and that this capacity will need to expand further to ensure the delivery of the national development plan 2000-2006. In considering this issue, it <Col N="150" /> must be borne in mind that Ireland, as part of the EU internal market, has access to building capacity outside its borders. There is already substantial participation in building projects from construction firms and workers located in other EU member states, and especially from Northern Ireland. The size of the investment in the NDP and the promotion of public private partnerships should encourage greater participation by firms from other EU member states in the design and construction of projects.</P>
      <P>The Government, in partnership with the industry, has already taken a number of steps to expand domestic building capacity, including the supply of serviced land.</P>
      <P>The intake of apprentices into the building trades has doubled from 2,300 in 1993-94 to 5,600 in 1999-2000. The employers' training levy of 0.7% of payroll, announced in the budget, should allow FÁS to cater for the increased intake of building trade apprentices.</P>
      <P>No problems are currently foreseen in ensuring that there will be adequate supplies of building materials and plant. Again, the NDP provides the building product manufacturers with a firm medium term basis for undertaking investment to expand capacity.</P>
      <P>However, the Government are not complacent in regard to the challenges posed for building capacity by the NDP &ndash; which contains building projects with a value in excess of £22 billion. In September, 1999, I asked the forum for the construction industry to expedite a study of the capacity of the industry. I am pleased to inform the House that I have recently received an interim report and recommendations from the forum which I will publish shortly. The forum's final report is due by the end of July next.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> The results of the assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last, indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other measures including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes. Details of the results of the assessment were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 5 October last.</P>
    <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was approximately 3,700 and the level of local authority house completions is expected to be in excess of 4,000 units this year. I also expect that authorities will commence the construction of, or acquire, in excess of 5,500 houses this year. I will have a clearer indication of the overall position when my Department receives from all local authorities their proposed housing programme for the current year. Authorities have been particularly asked to front load their programmes as much as possible where housing needs have escalated significantly.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is, of course, only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met and I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of over 11,000 households to be met this year, compared to some 9,700 last year.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given in tackling this need. The introduction of a multi-annual programme will enable authorities to provide a better and more effective mechanism for meeting social housing needs.</P>

In so far as private rented residential accommodation is concerned, the operation of the legislation is one of the areas being examined by the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector which I established last July.

      <P>In pursuit of its policy of more balanced regional development as set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government has mandated my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy over the next two years. On foot of this mandate, my Department has established a spatial planning unit, which will manage the preparation of the strategy. A team of staff assigned to work in the unit will be supplemented as necessary by outside consultants to work jointly with the Department on the strategy. It is intended to have the first phase of the process, identification of the scope of the strategy and the issues it will address, completed by the end of March.</P>
      <P>I believe that a strong &lsquo;bottom-up' consultative process is required to develop a high degree of consensus around the scope of the strategy, the principles and criteria to be applied and the proposals for applying those principles. I am, therefore, establishing contacts and putting in place arrangements for wide-ranging consultations with the relevant local, regional and sectoral interests. I am also establishing interdepartmental and cross-sectoral groups to oversee the process of preparing the strategy. In addition, discussions have taken place with the National Economic and Social Council and Comhar &ndash; the National Sustainable Development Partnership &ndash; with a view to availing of these partnership forums to channel input from the social partners and other interests represented by these bodies.</P>
      <P>A successful national spatial strategy will also require the understanding and support of the general public. I am, therefore, taking steps to improve awareness of and provide information about the proposed strategy and to promote informed public debate as the process evolves.</P>

In April 1998, my Department wrote to planning authorities asking that they avail of the opportunity presented by planning fee increases, which were effected by new regulations at that time, to consider the possibility of employing more professional planners. My Department again wrote to local authority managers in July 1998 asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional-technical and administrative-clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. The Department has approved almost all such requests for additional professional planners.</P>
      <P>Details of additional posts in local authority planning departments sanctioned by my Department during 1999 are set out in the table which will be included in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's only planning school is in the National University of Ireland, Dublin &ndash; University College Dublin and I have written to the president of that college indicating that the expansion of the economy has made for a greatly increased workload on the planning system and there is evidence of a shortfall in the number of professional planners to meet present requirements. I further outlined in that letter that the Planning and Development Bill and future EU requirements will confer further functions and place new obligations on planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála. I indicated that all these <Col N="155" /> developments will call for increased professional planning resources in this country and any increase in the number of planners qualifying would be welcomed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call made by Focus Ireland for annual expenditure of £39 million over the next five years to deal with the problem of homelessness; the plans, if any, he has to respond to this call; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the call reported in the media which was made by Focus Ireland for annual expenditure of £39 million over the next five years to deal with the problem of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a comprehensive response to homelessness was acknowledged in the establish<Col N="156" /> ment of the cross-department team on homelessness under the aegis of my Department whose remit includes health, education, employment as well as accommodation. The team is well advanced in the preparation of its report and it is expected that they will present their report in the near future with firm recommendations on how the problem of homelessness is to be tackled.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that homelessness can be a complex social problem and addiction can sometimes play a large part in people becoming homeless. In such cases, the provision of accommodation will not, on its own, suffice and accompanying support services will also be required. For this reason, a special £5 million allocation over the two years 2000 and 2001 was made in the recent budget for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction and is being made available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for these purposes. This allocation will supplement the £4 million allocation in the public capital programme for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is open to voluntary bodies to avail of funding under my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes to provide hostel and sheltered housing accommodation for homeless persons. My Department encourages voluntary bodies to avail of these schemes for the provision of voluntary housing accommodation and the financial provision for these schemes has been increased from £45 million in 1999 to £68 million for the present year. The upper unit cost limits under these schemes have also been significantly increased.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme also provides housing accommodation for homeless persons. The programme is being expanded to provide 22,000 additional units during the period 2000-2003 at an estimated cost of £1,585 million.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in introducing theory testing for provisional drivers; when he will introduce this test; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to driver theory testing which is being procured on a PPP basis. Consultants have been engaged to assist in the preparation of tender documents to this end, in the evaluation of tender proposals and in the drawing up of appropriate legal and contractual arrangements for the appointment of a contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the tendering process can be completed and a contract awarded in July 2000 <Col N="157" /> with a view to mobilising the new service as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 98 of 16 November 1999, an estimated 371,000 provisional licences were current as at 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>In order to attain this longer term goal, the short-term priority must be to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. I have already outlined, in the reply to Questions Nos. 81 and 101 and 558 on today's Order Paper, the significant additional measures and resources now being deployed to support this process.</P>
      <P>Measures have been in place for some years, and will be maintained, to limit the indefinite holding of provisional licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The first progress report of the high level group on road safety, was published in July 1999 and details progress with implementing the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. Copies of the progress report have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report notes good progress in 1998-99 towards the primary target of the road safety strategy of reducing road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002: 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997; 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997: this represents the lowest number of serious injuries for the last decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least 20% reduction.</P>
      <P>More recent provisional data from an Garda Síochána indicate that there were 413 road deaths in 1999 compared with 458 in 1998. This would represent a reduction of some 13% in road deaths relative to 1997 in the second full year of operation of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress towards the supporting targets of the Government strategy has also been made: car and truck speeds were slightly down; there were fewer <Col N="159" /> fatal accidents in the night-time hours (commonly drink related); engineering measures to reduce accidents were implemented at 93 national road locations in 1998.</P>
    <P>The report also describes progress on key strategy actions scheduled for early implementation, including the use of automatic speed detection systems, the introduction of evidential breath testing for drink driving and the extension of on-the-spot fines. Measures to prepare for, and/or give effect to those actions, are now well under way.</P>
    <P>In addition, the scheme of a new Road Traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide for a penalty points system. This will be brought before Government shortly with a view to publication of the Bill by mid 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 137 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the increase in emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases concerned, and I am aware of projections for increases of up to 59.5% in emissions of CO2 above 1990 levels by 2010, balanced by projections for lower increases in emissions of other greenhouse gases. This implies a net increase in overall emissions, on a business as usual basis, in the range 36.5% to 40%. These projections are being re-examined, including in relation to CO2, prior to finalisation of the national greenhouse gas abatement strategy for Government approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective policies are being developed to ensure that Ireland will meet our Kyoto target. <Col N="160" /> Measures previously put in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors were outlined in detail in Ireland's second national communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia, </i>address climate change.</P>
    <P>For purposes of the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol, a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland was published by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise in June 1998, as a basis for public consultation. Subsequently, the two Departments held a discussion forum for interested bodies, organisations and individuals who made submissions on the report. The submissions made, and the wide-ranging discussion at the forum, were utilised in the development of a draft national greenhouse gas abatement strategy.</P>
    <P>Last autumn, I invited Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnerships to consider and make recommendations on the draft strategy. Work is now proceeding as a priority within my Department, with appropriate interdepartmental input through the green network of Government Departments, to finalise the strategy for Government approval, having regard to the views of Comhar and other developments including the recent green paper on sustainable energy published by the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>As part of the development of an overall policy to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target, I also established a consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading to assess greenhouse gas emissions trading as it affects Irish policy formation. The group is, in addition, examining the option of a domestic emissions trading market, and the implications for Ireland of an international trading regime.</P>
    <P>In April 1999, I received an interim report from the group concerning the formulation of an overall EU policy regarding the use of concrete ceilings on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be traded under the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms, including international emissions trading. A copy of this interim report, together with my response to it, are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I understand that the group is now preparing its main report and I hope to receive it as early as possible in 2000.</P>

      <P>These forecasts of continued strong population growth and particularly growth in the number of new households together with strong economic growth point towards continued high levels of demand for housing.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Part B of the second schedule to the Building Regulations 1997 sets out the legal requirements relating to fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings and the reconstruction of existing buildings. The building regulations themselves do not place a restriction on the types of materials or the method of construction which can be used provided that the requirements of the regulations are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 12 comprehensive technical guidance documents which accompany the building regu<Col N="163" /> lations provide guidance on how to comply with the regulations. Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety (1997 edition) &ndash; provides guidance on requirements for fire resisting construction, either of a combustible or non-combustible nature, in particular situations, e.g. party walls between buildings, walls and floors which divide a building into fire compartments.</P>
    <P>The combustibility, or non-combustibility, of elements of construction such as floors and staircases is just one of a number of considerations which go towards the provision of fire safety in a building and the use of combustible materials may not in itself constitute a fire hazard.</P>
    <P>Wood is a traditional and environmentally sustainable building material. I understand that wood is used widely in Europe in the construction of staircases and bedroom floors. I am advised that the current technical guidance in relation to staircases and bedroom floors, including the use of timber in particular situations, is adequate. Accordingly, I have no plans to change the current guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Analysis on the extent of the problem of climate change is provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, IPCC, which is the authoritative source of scientific information in this regard. The IPCC second assessment report &ndash; SAR &ndash; in 1995 concluded that &ldquo;the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate&rdquo; and that &ldquo;climate is expected to continue to change in the future&rdquo; as a result.</P>
      <P>The IPCC best estimate, based on their mid range of emissions scenarios, projects a global mean surface air temperature increase of about 2º centigrade and a 50cm rise in sea level by 2100 relative to 1990. The high/low range in each case is 1º centigrade to 3.5 centigrade temperature increase and 15cm to 95cm rise in sea level. The IPCC concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that climate change will cause a maximum surface warming in high northern latitudes in winter, an enhanced and more vigorous global mean hydrological cycle, with increased precipitation and soil moisture in high latitudes in winter, prospects for more severe droughts and-or floods in some places and less severe impacts in others, and increased precipitation intensity, suggesting a possibility for more extreme rainfall events.</P>
      <P>The SAR indicates that cuts in global emissions of CO2 of the order of 70% over the next 100 years and beyond will be required to ensure stabilisation of CO2 concentrations at twice the pre-industrial levels.</P>
      <P>The IPCC third assessment report on climate change is due to be published later this year, and I will give careful consideration to its conclusions when available.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the IPCC first scientific assessment of climate change 1990, my Department commissioned a study &ldquo;Climate Change Studies on the Implications for Ireland&rdquo; (B. McWilliams ed., November 1991). This examined the potential impacts on agriculture; forestry; Ireland's flora and fauna; hydrology and freshwater resources; sea level changes; and fisheries and shell fisheries in coastal waters. A copy of the study is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

On 30 November 1999 the Government approved measures for the early grant of a large number of new taxi licences in Dublin, involving the offer of one additional taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each individual who held a licence at end 1999, as well as 500 further licences to be granted to applicants under the current points assessment system. Some 500 of the licences to be granted will be in respect of wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meetings were held at their request with taxi representatives in December 1999 and this month at which details of the measures to be implemented were explained. In addition I have <Col N="166" /> responded in writing to a number of stated concerns presented to me by taxi interests.</P>
    <P>On 13 January 2000, I made regulations which establish an application process for all existing taxi licence holders in Dublin to apply for the grant of either a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence from Dublin Corporation. Individual notice to this effect has issued or is issuing to each existing licence holder, and applications must be received by the corporation on or before 18 February 2000. It will be possible at that stage to indicate details of the number of licence applications.</P>
    <P>The regulations also provide for the making of an offer to grant a wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each licence holder who expresses a preference for the grant of such a licence and who complies with the requirements of the regulations. The remaining licences, including those to be offered to applicants under the current assessment system, are to be allocated in accordance with a scheme which I will shortly finalise.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by the president of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute regarding falling standards in the home construction industry; the steps, if any, being taken to ensure that all houses are constructed to an acceptable standard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding standards of new houses expressed by the president of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute. I understand that the IAVI president suggested that there was a decline in the standards of finish in new housing in her comments, with particular reference to lengthening snag lists. This is an issue that has been taken up by the Director of Consumer Affairs and my Department will be pursuing the issue further with the Director and the Irish Home Builder's Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was also posed by the IAVI president that, if standards of finish are falling, whether there should be concerns regarding structural standards. The primary responsibility for ensuring that proper construction standards are met in housing rests with developers, designers and builders. HomeBond, the national house building guarantee scheme, inspect newly constructed houses before offering their ten year warranty, which of course covers major defects of a structural nature. My Department's housing inspectors inspect new houses, for which new house grant applications have been lodged, for compliance with the grant standards. Both HomeBond and my Department's inspectorate are, <Col N="167" /> therefore, well placed to observe whether construction standards, particularly in relation to major structural defects, are declining and neither my Department nor HomeBond have found evidence of a decline in structural standards of construction.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has received no reports, from members or practices, of any significant decline in construction standards for new houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department lays down no specific standard for construction of local authority housing other than that the form of construction used should comply with the building regulations. Traditionally, local authorities and many private developers and builders have favoured cavity wall construction while some private developers and builders, mainly in the greater Dublin area, have opted for hollow block construction.</P>
      <P>The building regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, provided the performance requirements of the regulations are met e.g. in relation to thermal performance, structural stability, etc. It is a matter for building owners, designers and builders to ensure that their buildings comply with the regulations and to select the form of construction and product which best meets their needs in achieving this.</P>

      <P>The secretary to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution wrote to me on 12 July 1999 seeking a copy of my proposals for a change in the electoral system. I replied on 20 July 1999 indicating that I had not finalised any proposals in my capacity as Minister because the committee had been given <Col N="168" /> the task of examining this issue as part of their examination of the institutions of State.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, I informed the secretary to the committee that I believe that we should change our electoral system to one using STV in single seat constituencies. I also believe it would probably be necessary to have some list element included in order to ensure proportionality and representation for smaller parties and individuals. I have not asked the committee to report in a specific timeframe. I look forward to the report and recommendations of the committee which will, I hope, provide a basis for an informed public debate on our electoral system and the scope for reform.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be met from their own resources, and information is not available in my Department on the number of local authority houses which do not have a central heating installation. However, where capital funding is being provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates, the <Col N="169" /> installation of central heating in these houses may form part of the works undertaken. In addition, some authorities have been granted approval, on foot of specific proposals, to the use of their internal capital receipts to provide central heating in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were advised in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority housing as part of the overall cost of the schemes. The choice of heating system and fuel should be determined by the local authority primarily by reference to expected capital and running costs, including possible servicing and maintenance costs, and the preference of the likely occupants. social housing design guidelines issued in September 1999 also advised that the most usual choice of heating system will be a standard central heating system based on a single boiler for dwellings and heat distribution by hot water to radiators. Irrespective of the main space heating system and fuel used authorities have also been advised to give consideration to providing a secondary means of heating in the main living room.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the existing funding arrangements.</P>

Preliminary testing of equipment supplied by a number of companies is continuing and will be completed next month. I will be further considering the general question as to the use of electronic equipment at elections.</P>

    <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including the serving of notices under section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, to prevent or control pollution of waters, rests primarily with local authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency is also responsible for water management and protection in so far as activities licensable by the agency are concerned, and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes and the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment. The functions of the EPA in this regard include supervision of the performance of statutory environmental functions by local authorities. Data are provided to my Department by local authorities in relation to their activities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990, including the serving of notices under section 12 of the 1977 Act.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Bill 2000 is at an advanced stage of drafting and is scheduled for publication in the current Dáil session. The Bill is substantial with more than 200 sections; it will consolidate and modernise local government law, implement a range of reforms and generally underpin the programme of local government renewal. The Bill will <i>inter alia</i>, include provision for the direct election of cathaoirligh of county and city councils from the next local elections in 2004. As part of the programme of local government renewal a whole series of initiatives designed to transform local government have already been taken; and action is well in hands across a range of fronts. A new funding system is in place, a major planning Bill is before the Oireachtas, constitutional recognition has been accorded to local government, together with a fixed electoral cycle; the partnership model is being introduced via the strategic policy committees, modern financial management, accounting and VFM systems have been developed; strengthened management structures are ready for implementation; the first element in <Col N="173" /> a training programme for councillors is complete; funding was provided for a one stop shop initiative; the next phase of SMI for local authorities is about to be launched; county-city development boards will be established shortly. All in all these and other initiatives represent a major programme of action for the renewal of local government which the Local Government Bill will support and underpin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The DTI strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-ring; other improvements in public transport such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures. Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructural projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the DART extensions and the southern cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas, the Dublin Port Tunnel and the south-eastern and northern motorways. By end-1999, an estimated £500 million had been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, which endorses most of the investment proposed in the Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-06 published by the DTO in September 1999, more than £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The DTO short-term action plan, published in September 1998, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. Detailed objectives include: completion of 12 QBCs and 180 kms of cycle tracks by end 2000, provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £26 million, additional rolling stock for DART, lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms, and upgrading by end 2000 of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the short-term action plan. For example, the programme of platform lengthening has commenced; contracts have been entered into for the additional DART rolling stock; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network with three QBCs now in <Col N="174" /> operation; and all 150 of the new buses have been delivered.</P>
    <P>In addition, the office of director of traffic, Dublin Corporation, has been established to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration within the city and has already achieved significant improvements in parking enforcement and traffic engineering.</P>
    <P>For the longer term the DTO is currently updating the original DTI strategy. This will lead to the publication by the end of March 2000 of an updated strategy for the period 2000-2016.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 75 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Regarding the measures that have had a positive impact on house prices, I would draw his attention to the range of measures introduced by the Government in its policy documents, Action on House Prices and Action on the Housing Market. The Government's strategy is to maximise housing output where demand is greatest and remove bottlenecks to residential development whether in, for example, the supply of serviced land or the planning process, etc.</P>
      <P>Output under the serviced land initiative is expected to exceed original estimates and other key infrastructure projects are progressing well. Additional planning staff have been recruited by local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to remove bottlenecks in processing planning applications. Further initiatives include guidelines to local authorities on increased residential densities to ensure more efficient use of land without compromising on quality of design and the measures proposed in Part V of the Planning and Development Bill 1999, which will require local authorities to prepare housing strategies and to zone sufficient land in their development plans for housing. Authorities will be required to estimate the amount of housing required in their area and up to 20% of land to be used for residential purposes must be made available for social or affordable housing. Measures introduced to assist affordability for lower income and first-time purchasers include the withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty rates, a lowering of the capital gains tax rate from 40% to 20% on the sale of land for residential development to speed up the sale of land with development potential, the introduction of the local authority affordable housing scheme and improvements in the local authority shared ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> A co-ordinating housing supply unit has been established in my Department to drive and effectively deliver all elements of the housing supply strategy. The range of Government measures are having effect in moderating house price increases and this effect will be increasingly evident throughout the coming year.</P>

      <P>The water scheme is ninth and the sewerage scheme eleventh on the list of projects submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request for local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the need for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment programmes for this and future years under the national development plan 2000-06.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 526, 567 and 569 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, primary responsibility for the development and implementation of responses to litter pollution rests with the individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that local authorities generally are using the extended powers available to them under the 1997 Act to take a more pro-active approach to combating litter. Local authority enforcement figures for the first half of 1999 &ndash; the latest national figures available &ndash; show that over 8,200 on-the-spot fines issued in this period; 859 prosecutions were taken and there were 354 convictions. These figures represent significant improvement over earlier periods. Detailed statistics on the number of litter wardens employed, prosecutions, convictions, and on-the-spot fines issued and paid are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Despite the improvement in local authority enforcement action, the extent of the national litter pollution problem remains a major concern. I have, therefore, been pursuing a programme of action to support more effective local authority action against litter, including increasing the on-the-spot fine for alleged offences under the 1997 Act from £25 to £50, with effect from 3 January 2000; allocation of £350,000 in grant aid to local authorities to co-fund public anti-litter education and awareness projects. This brings the total grants allocated to local authorities for anti-litter initiatives in the last three years to almost £1 million. A similar grant scheme will operate in 2000; financial support for the An Taisce led project, national spring clean, which aims to raise public awareness and participation in local anti-litter clean-ups and awareness actions to improve the local environment. It includes a central role for local authorities and will be an on-going annual event; development of a national litter pollution monitoring system to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action and to advise my Department on litter management planning at national level. The system will be implemented over the coming months; establishment of a national anti-litter forum last July to promote greater sectoral involvement, in particular on the part of the business and commercial sectors, in anti-litter initiatives. The forum is reviewing the current actions targeting litter pollution and developing a programme of measures to enhance and extend those responses. It is due to report next month.</P>
      <P>I will continue to work actively with local authorities and the various sectors to secure effective implementation of the range of ongoing measures and to develop new anti-litter initiatives.</P>

      <P>Based on staffing returns supplied to my Department as at 31 December, 1998 &ndash; the most up-to-date information available to my Department &ndash; the number of staff including part-time staff in the local authority service is 27,168.78 whole-time equivalents; the number of staff with disabilities is 732; the percentage of local authority staff with a disability is 2.7%. The commitment in Partnership 2000 that the 3% quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the local authority service be met during the lifetime of the partnership has been brought to the attention of the local authorities which have not yet reached the 3% quota; they have been requested to make every effort to ensure that the quota would be achieved by the end of the period of the agreement. The 1999 staffing statistics should be available later in the year.</P>
      <P>I also launched in September last a new code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the local authority service. This code was developed after extensive public consultation, including disability interests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Acts the Office of Public Works is empowered to undertake drainage schemes in response to flooding from any <Col N="180" /> watercourse for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing incidences of flooding. Other responsibilities in relation to certain navigable waters rest with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Waterways Ireland, the new cross-Border authority. While local authorities are empowered under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, to execute works affording relief or protection from flooding, my Department has no substantive involvement by way of grant assistance or otherwise with these provisions.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is not a matter for my Department to formulate a response to the problem of flooding in the Shannon catchment. Grants from the Environment Vote to local authorities for public water supply and sewerage schemes address flood relief requirements only in the context of measures to relieve overloading of existing sewerage networks in built up areas.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that flooding risks may be taken into account in the development process, the Planning and Development Bill 1999, will allow local authorities to make it an objective of development plans to regulate, restrict or control development in areas at risk of flooding whether inland or coastal.</P>

      <P>Due to legal doubts expressed about the terms and conditions initially advertised for the post of DPP, it was decided to extend the time for applications and to publish a revised advertisement which did not refer to the fixed term non-renewable nature of the post.</P>
      <P>Section 2(7) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, provides that candidates for appointment to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions shall be selected by a committee of which the senior legal assistant in the office of the Attorney General shall be a member.

    <P>Pursuant to the Act, on 20 May 1999, I requested the members of the committee, including the then senior legal assistant, to select candidates. By letter dated 4 June, the senior legal assistant advised me that he intended to be a can<Col N="182" /> didate for the position of DPP and consequently would be unable to act as a member of the committee. Pursuant to the Act, following consultation with the Attorney General, I appointed the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be a member of the committee as a replacement for the senior legal assistant.</P>

      <P>The national millennium committee commissioned the design and production of 1.3 million candles as part of its role in selecting appropriate ways of marking the millennium in Ireland in an inclusive manner. The candle, accompanied by a scroll, was the central focus of a national event, the last light ceremony, on the afternoon of New Year's Eve to coincide with the final sunset of this millennium.</P>
      <P>It was the intention of the millennium committee that every household in the country would receive a candle and scroll in a presentation box. An Post was selected as the delivery agent for the candles. It took its address data from the 1999 electoral register. The number of households on this register is approximately 1.28 million. The stipulation was that each household would receive through the An Post delivery service one candle.</P>
      <P>The national millennium committee became aware before Christmas that some households had not received delivery of a candle. The national millennium office has regularly updated An Post as regards complaints about non-delivery of candles. Every effort is now being made to establish the exact position in relation to the matter. Representatives of the national millennium office will meet with An Post in the near future to discuss the entire delivery question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that one or more complaints have been made to the Competition Authority alleging anti-competitive activities in the meat processing industry and that this matter has been under investigation by the Director of Competition Enforcement for some time. Under the terms of the Competition Act, 1991, application may be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the inspection of premises and documents found on such premises and the questioning of persons carrying out activities on such premises.</P>
      <P>District Justices may not issue warrants unless they are satisfied by information on oath that it is proper for them to do so for the purpose of obtaining information necessary to discharge functions under the Act. I understand that it would not be usual to apply for a warrant unless the application can be supported by <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the Act is being breached. I understand that no application has yet been made in connection with the investigation being undertaken by the Director of Competition Enforcement.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions. The purpose of its investigations into complaints is to establish whether grounds exist for initiating legal proceedings against the undertakings complained of and they do not report to me on the outcome of those investigations.</P>
      <P>Quite separately from the investigation being undertaken by the authority, the Government decided, at its meeting on 19 January, to establish an independent group to examine the continuing allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry and the alleged failure of consumer prices to reflect reductions in producer prices. The independent group, which has already begun its work, is composed of Mr. Kevin Bonner, chairman, Professor Seamus Sheehy and Mr. Colm McCarthy. The terms of reference of the group are to examine allegations of anti-competitive practice in the beef industry; to establish why there is such a large differential between the producer price and the prevailing consumer price, and to make any appropriate recommendations in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the urgency of this matter and with a <Col N="185" /> view to restoring confidence in the industry and ensuring that the interests of the consumer are protected, I have asked the group to report to me by 28 April 2000. As is evident from the terms of reference, the group's remit relates to the beef industry where the recent problems have arisen and I have no plans to include pigs and lambs in the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal piece of legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. Under section 12 of the 1989 Act every employer must prepare a written safety statement which should be based on an identification and assessment of all hazards and risks in the workplace and which should specify the way in which the safety, health and welfare of employees is to be secured. The authority recommends that details of an anti-bullying policy should be included in this safety statement.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, I set up a task force on the prevention of workplace bullying which is being chaired by an independent chairperson and is operating under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority. The task force is examining workplace bullying in detail and is focusing on identifying the size of the problem and the employment sectors most at risk as well as developing proposals for practical programmes and strategies, both to prevent workplace bullying and to provide an appropriate response from the relevant State agencies. The membership of the task force is drawn from a number of Government Departments and State agencies and also includes representation from IBEC and ICTU.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wishes to make a submission to this task force on the issue of workplace bullying may do so by directly contacting the task force secretariat at the Health and Safety Authority, 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2 or at tel. no. 01-6147000, at fax no. 01-6147021 or by e-mail at bully&ndash;taskforce@hsa.ie.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that under the Employment Equality Act 1998, discrimination and harassment in relation to employment is prohibited on nine distinct grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. This Act is administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force is due to report at the end of <Col N="186" /> March 2000. Given the importance of establishing the factual position in relation to workplace bullying and the need to establish definitions in the area, I am unwilling to commit myself to any particular course of action until such time as the task force has made its report and the board of the Health and Safety Authority has given me its advice on the matter.</P>

      <P>FÁS's action plan for the long-term unemployed, published at the end of 1998, set out a range of supports which FÁS is providing to support the reintegration of long-term unemployed people into the workforce. One of the targets set out in the action plan was that a minimum of 20% of people starting FÁS's mainline training programmes for the unemployed would be long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures available on FÁS programme participation for 1999 relate to the year up to the end of November 1999. A total of 13,360 people started FÁS mainline training programmes for the unemployed during the first eleven months of 1999. Of these, 2,975 were long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed therefore represented over 22% of all new starters on these programmes up to the end of November 1999. This exceeds the national minimum participation target which FÁS set in its action plan for the long-term unemployed.</P>

The results of the survey currently in hand are likely to be published in early summer 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period since the last national survey of vacancies in autumn 1998, we have experienced substantial growth in employment and the labour force, leading to further reductions in unemployment. For example, based on the most recent releases from the Central Statistics Office, including the quarterly national household survey for <Col N="188" /> third quarter 1999 and the live register statement for December 1999, the standardised unemployment rate has fallen to 5% and the long-term unemployment rate has fallen to 2.1%. Falling unemployment leading to an ever tightening labour market can be reflected in an increased incidence of vacancies which may be confirmed by the ESRI survey which is currently being completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The stipulation of 66 as the maximum age for statutory redundancy payments purposes stems from the fact that 66 is the age at which people qualify for the old age pension. Employees at that age become entitled to an old age contributory pension or to an old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, make provision for minimum redundancy payments for employees being under the age of 66 and, therefore, not yet being entitled to either of these two State pensions, provided that they have at least two years service, are 16 years of age or older at the time of termination of employment and fulfil the other statutory criteria.</P>

      <P>The report entitled &ldquo;Athy Socio-Economic Profile&rdquo;, compiled by the Athy Investment Development and Employment Forum in November 1999, was provided to me recently by the secretary of the forum. Subsequently, the secretary wrote to me requesting a meeting between the forum and myself with a view to discussing the report.</P>
      <P>I have had the report examined by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and FÁS, who are the agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development, and requested their views on the report's proposals. As you may be aware, FÁS, the national training authority, compiled a report entitled &ldquo;Labour Market and Skills Analysis, Athy&rdquo; in 1998 and many of the FÁS conclusions are borne out in the forum's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the central issues of declining industry, low levels of development in recent times and the move towards dormitory town <Col N="190" /> status highlighted in the report, FÁS considers issues such as the growth in early school-leavers, access to training facilities and the need for a flexible labour force as further priorities to be addressed. FÁS also notes that there is a significant number of long-term unemployed persons in Athy whose prospects of finding employment are limited, and is actively seeking to involve this group of people in community employment schemes as an interim solution to addressing the employment problem.</P>
    <P>FÁS has also appointed placement officers to the town to interview clients on the live register and work full time with the local employment scheme while also liaising with local employers and LES mediators.

Through its representation on the forum, IDA Ireland will also be supportive of proactive proposals brought forward to address long-term unemployment issues. IDA Ireland has committed to and is delivering on its promise to have an advance factory constructed and to seek to secure a project for the new building. Site work commenced in November 1999 and the factory is due for completion in May 2000.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland held a meeting with senior officials of both Kildare County Council and Athy Urban District Council on 12 January 2000 to consider what initiatives might be taken to accelerate the development of Athy against the background of the forum's report.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a comprehensive profile of Athy would be developed with emphasis on telecommunications, infrastructure and labour availability. In particular, the meeting identified the need for good quality office type accommodation to be provided in the town to enable it to compete for a number of emerging opportunities. A plan of action was agreed with Kildare County Council in this regard with progress to be reviewed at a follow up meeting to take place in Athy on 23 February 2000.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will also be working closely with the local authority representatives on the best possible approach to be taken in presenting Athy to prospective investors. A number of other initiatives are being explored by the agency and the local authority to address the identified problems.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, given these initiatives together with the commitment of the people of Athy, the prospects for the future of the town are positive.</P>

      <P>In its annual competitiveness reports for 1998 and 1999, the national competitiveness council &ndash; NCC &ndash; discussed the topic of regulatory reform and its impact on competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The work of the council focused initially on the general principles that should apply in regulatory reform, as well as an assessment of the existing regulatory framework for enterprise in Ireland and the identification of broad sectors for further examination. Two sectors, transport and business services, were identified for more detailed examination because of their links throughout the economy.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, following a competitive tendering process, Forfás on behalf of the NCC, commissioned research on competitive changes in the transport sector from Peter Bacon and Associates. A copy of the consultant's terms of reference is set out at Appendix 1. The study focused on several aspects of the transport sector including road freight services; air transport services; ports and sea transport services; and surface passenger transport.</P>
      <P>The consultants have finalised a report that reviews competitiveness in the different parts of the transport sector and makes recommendations on how regulatory reform could improve competitiveness in areas including infrastructure provision; internal surface passenger transport; air and sea ports; road freight services; and information requirements to allow ongoing monitoring of the position. This report is not expected to be published in its own right, but is intended as an input to a draft competitiveness council statement on regulatory reform, covering the economy as a whole, for the consideration of the council. In preparing this, Forfás will draw on several studies carried out including transport, business services and comparative institutional frameworks.</P>
      <P Just="Center">APPENDIX 1</P>
      <P Just="Center">Terms of Reference for the National Competitiveness Council</P>
      <P Just="Center">Study on Regulatory Reform in the Transport Sector.</P>
      <P>1. <i>Background</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Regulatory reform in Ireland is a priority for enterprise policy, and is essential for competitiveness. There are a number of reasons for this:</P>
      <P>Many of the traditional instruments used by Government to encourage enterprise are no longer available, because of EU rules, EMU and other international agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other countries have been placing considerable emphasis on regulatory reform, including many of our close competitors, because they see it as a way to improve competition, to <Col N="192" /> increase the efficiency of markets and promote the interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>Changes in the regulatory system in Ireland have been fragmented, undertaken in response to EU directives or associated with particular privatisation issues.</P>
    <P>In Ireland no comprehensive review has been undertaken of existing regulation and its effects, and no statement exists of the principles to be followed in the future.</P>
    <P>Regulatory reform amounts to a redistribution of costs and benefits of the existing system. These costs can be substantial. However, the cost of the reform itself is usually low, and the return on the &ldquo;investment&rdquo; can be very high.</P>
    <P>Forfás, the industrial policy advisory board for Ireland, is undertaking research on regulatory reform and the kinds of policy changes needed in Ireland to improve competitiveness. This work is intended to provide inputs to the National Competitiveness Council, and to assist policy makers in preparing decisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Initial work has been undertaken by Forfás that covers the following aspects: 1. the arguments for regulatory reform; 2. principles of policy to be applied; 3. regulation in Ireland; 4. summary of sectoral regulation; 5. mechanisms for regulation and 6. recommendations.</P>
    <P>Among the recommendations of the initial study is that more detailed analysis be undertaken of the regulatory position with regard to key sectors of the economy. Through linkage effects, a number of other sectors are affected by their operations. The purpose of the present study is to undertake detailed analysis of a sector with a view to deriving policy conclusions. Attention in the study should focus on activities within the sector where regulatory reform is likely to improve competition.</P>
    <P>The inland transport service sector is defined as railway transport services and associated services; local transport services, including underground railways, tramways and regular bus services; long distance road transport services for passengers; long distance road transport services for merchandise; services of transport by pipelines; land-borne transport services (funicular railways, cable cars, chairlifts) and inland waterways services. In addition to these, the study should also cover regulatory reforms for Ireland in air services, air ports and sea ports.</P>
    <P>2. <i>Outputs</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The contractor will prepare a report covering the following topics:</P>
    <P>Economic overview of the sector: this will describe its size, structure, linkages, employment and ownership, contribution to GDP, and productivity trends.</P>
    <P>Existing regulation of the sector: this will summarise the principal legislation covering the activities of the sector.</P>
    <P>Institutional aspects of regulation: this will <Col N="193" /> include an overview of the nature, composition, and operating methods of the institutions concerned with regulation of the sector. Self-regulating bodies and associations should be included as appropriate, as well as a commentary on the nature and extent of communications between the economic actors concerned and Government.</P>
    <P>Diagnosis: an assessment of the need for improved regulation of the sector based on the need for improved competition, especially in so far as it would lower prices, improve quality and increase choice of services.</P>
    <P>Recommendations: Policy changes needed in the regulatory regime of the sector, distinguishing between immediate short-term measures that could be implemented quickly and more fundamental longer term structural changes required.</P>
    <P>The report should include an &ldquo;Executive Summary&rdquo; of no more than ten pages in length.</P>
    <P>3. <i>Method of work</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The contractor will draw on the following in carrying out the work: legislation: the principal legislation will be examined for the key impacts on the operations of the sector and existing studies: the contractor will review relevant studies in the economic and regulatory literature providing information on the sectors operations in Ireland and in other countries. Work of international organisations, especially OECD, will be drawn upon as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Discussions will be held with the sector in question, especially through its representative bodies, and with business associations, Government Departments and other bodies in order to identify data sources, relevant studies and also to highlight key areas of concern with regard to the regulatory regime for the sector in question and to assess the degree to which the sector is meeting the requirements of its customers. Discussions will also be held with specialists in relevant areas at universities and institutes of higher education. A provisional list of bodies to be consulted is given below.</P>

      <P>Six examinations of company books and documents are ongoing at present in my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Ltd., College Trustees Ltd., Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd., Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd. and Kentford Securities Ltd.</P>
      <P>While I also decided some time ago to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Ltd. and Dunnes Stores Ireland Company, this decision has been judicially reviewed. The High Court determined <i>inter alia</i> on 6 July last that my decision was properly made. However, I am at present awaiting a Supreme Court decision on appeals made by both sides against aspects of the High Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three further inquiries are being undertaken by inspectors appointed by the High Court at my request under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are National Irish Bank Ltd., National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. and Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. The latter two followed from Departmental investigations undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989 and section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 respectively. In addition, three investigations have been completed into the following companies: Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, and <Col N="195" /> Faxhill Homes Ltd. and Garuda Ltd., both under section 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>In the cases of Bula and Faxhill, my Department is considering, in conjunction with our legal advisers, whether I should initiate summary prosecutions for various suspected offences under the Companies Acts. In the Garuda case, I am not in a position to prosecute any company law offences arising from this report, due to the expiry of the applicable time limits in section 240(5) of the Companies Act, 1990 for the initiation of summary proceedings.</P>
    <P>Under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, I have also disclosed the completed reports, where appropriate, to the Minister for Finance, the DPP, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and a number of other parties. As further reports are submitted on completion of the outstanding investigations, I will be deciding, in conjunction with my legal advisers, what action is appropriate in individual cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was drawn to the harvesting of lug worm for commercial purposes at Blind Harbour in Broadhaven Bay, County Mayo and to local concerns over the possibility of damage to the cockle stocks and the environment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I arranged for a technical officer of my Department and a representative of Dúchas, the Heri<Col N="196" /> tage Service, which has responsibility for nature conservation, to inspect the site with representatives of Lugach Teo. which is the company organising the harvesting. They reported that they found no unacceptable environmental damage or evidence of damage to the cockle beds as a result of this activity. The company had discussions with Dúchas over the preceding two years and had carried out detailed studies before harvesting commenced. Dúchas has raised no objection to the harvesting of lug worm at this location as proposed and carried out.</P>
    <P>The harvesting of lug worm is done on a strictly seasonal basis at low tide by digging with a fork. Lugach Teo. is training approximately 20 local people to do the work in an environmentally acceptable manner which minimises damage to the foreshore. The activities being carried out are no different from what is being carried out &ndash; and what has been carried out traditionally for several generations &ndash; in an unstructured manner all around our coasts.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the activity concerned is, in the strict sense, a licensable activity under the Foreshore Acts, but so too is the collection of cockle, rag worm and periwinkle. It would be inequitable and indefensible to apply the provisions of the Act solely to this commercial activity. There would also be the risk that, if the requirement for a foreshore licence was insisted upon, the activities under the aegis of Lugach Teo. would be discontinued but would be continued by individuals in an unstructured way.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances, I decided that I would not insist upon foreshore licences being held by those gathering cockle, lug worm, rag worm or periwinkle provided that only traditional methods were used and that the agreement of Dúchas was obtained in regard to both methods and locations for such activities. I reserve the right to use my powers under the Foreshore Acts to order the cessation of digging or to regulate it if, for environmental or other reasons, I deem it appropriate to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The forest inventory and planning system or FIPS is the geographic information system, GIS, currently being developed by the Forest Service. FIPS is a strategic planning and administration tool that will function on a number of different levels, not least of which is the generation of national, regional and local forestry statistics.</P>
      <P>It will assist the Forest Service in guiding the location and character of future afforestation by identifying areas suitable for forestry development from an environmental and landscape perspective. In order to achieve this, FIPS has been designed to manage the administration of all forestry grant schemes and felling licence applications, thereby allowing proposed forestry development to be cross-referenced with all key environmental datasets. These datasets include national heritage areas, special protection areas, special areas of conservation, county development plans and also catchment areas of sensitive waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also incorporated into the system is the EU signs and symptoms form, which will help collate valuable information on pest and disease out<Col N="198" /> breaks throughout the country. In addition to fulfilling EU obligations with regard to recording this data, this function will provide the baseline information essential in planning and implementing measures designed to control these outbreaks.</P>
    <P>FIPS is characterised by its significant development potential not only in the area of forest management but also in its potential as a tool to assist in environmental impact studies. The most significant development feature of FIPS, however, is its accessibility by remote users either through the Internet or through ISDN connections.</P>
    <P>The Forest Service hopes to continue its work on FIPS so that commercial forestry companies and private growers can log on to the system to process grant and premium applications electronically. Further development will also allow for public access over the Internet, thereby allowing widespread access to forestry information by schools and individuals interested, for example, in finding out the composition of the forest estate in their local area.</P>

      <P>The ban on the use of monofilament nets for driftnetting for salmon was lifted as part of a balanced package of salmon conservation measures introduced in 1997 on foot of the recommendations of the salmon management task force.</P>
      <P>These measures include a reduction in the number of days for commercial salmon fishing from five days per week to four days per week; a ban on night time fishing; a reduction in the area for fishing at sea from 12 miles to six miles; a reduction in the length of the open season for commercial drift net fishing to two months, that is, June and July; a deferral of the opening of the season for commercial draft net fishing to 12 May; a cap on, and a reduction in, the number of commercial licences.</P>
      <P>The package of measures was adopted in order to address the decline in Irish salmon stocks and to lead to the recovery of the spawning stock of these fish. They will be reviewed by the national salmon commission.</P>

      <P>Last year this fishery enjoyed the longest commercial salmon fishing season in the country. The open season extended from 12 May to 14 August. Fishing was permitted on a four day week, 24 hour basis from 12 May to 11 June and a five day week, 24 hour day basis for the rest of the season. The drift net season generally ran from 1 June to 31 July on a four day week basis during the hours of daylight only. The draft net season generally ran from 12 May to 31 July on a four day week basis. There are no plans to alter the snap net fishing season in the Waterford estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon conservation measures now in <Col N="200" /> place are based on the recommendations of the salmon management task force. At the heart of these measures is the need to ensure that sufficient numbers of fish return to our rivers each year to spawn in the interest of the long-term sustainability of the fisheries. The salmon commission will be reviewing, as part of its remit, conservation and management strategies overall and specific arrangements by sector and area.</P>
    <P>Salmon populations remain very vulnerable and therefore it is imperative that the commitment to protection, conservation and management of our salmon fisheries is sustained by everybody involved, be they commercial or angling interests.</P>

      <P>European Union law precludes my Department from grant aiding afforestation where it will have an adverse effect on the environment. It is a matter for my Department to form a view as to whether a particular proposal is likely to have such an effect. To assist in this matter, appropriate advice is sought from relevant competent bodies.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the views of the relevant regional fisheries board and local authority were sought. Both competent authorities were opposed to the application as they were of the opinion that afforestation would adversely affect the water quality in the Lough Conn catchment. Moreover, it is the opinion of my Department that the fertility of the site in question is such as to be unlikely to produce a commercial crop of trees. For the above reasons the proposal could not be grant-aided.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that alternative grant assistance may be available under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>Under a special scheme introduced with the approval of the European Commission, the licensing and registration position of previously unregistered small fishing vessels is being regularised. Some 1,000 applications were received under the scheme, and licences have been granted in respect of 629 vessels to date.</P>

The remaining applications under the scheme are being processed to finality at present.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the special scheme was 17 February 1995. Applications received after that date are not being considered for licensing under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is seeking to have a boat licensed under the special scheme. The only recorded application from him in my Department consists of documents received in December 1996, that is, well after the closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme.

      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 93 states have signed the statute and, of these, six have ratified the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Accordingly, considerable resources were made available to ensure that Ireland was represented at and participated in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the statute. Ireland continues to be represented at the <Col N="203" /> preparatory commission set up after the Rome conference to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ratification process, I should point out that the statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 Articles. A careful and detailed examination of the statute by my Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary in order to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute. Only when these measures have been adopted may Ireland proceed to ratify the statute.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this matter is also being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since early September last year Russian forces have been carrying out a military campaign in Chechnya, following incursions by Chechen rebels into neighbouring Dagestan and a spate of bombing attacks in Russia blamed on the rebels. The capital city, Grozny, and southern Chechnya are now the scene of intense fighting between Russian ground forces and Chechen rebels. Heavy casualties have been suffered by both sides, but independently verified figures are not available. An estimated 20,000 civilians remain in Grozny. According to the UNHCR more than 180,000 displaced people are still in the neighbouring Russian republic of Ingushetia, 140,000 of them accommodated with host families, 25,000 in camps and another 28,000 in makeshift settlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the need for the federal authorities to take measures to deal with terrorism. However, the loss of civilian life and the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict zone in Chechnya is a matter of the utmost concern. The Government condemns attacks on civilians, who<Col N="204" /> ever the perpetrators, and has allocated IR£220,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen internally-displaced persons. This allocation will augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of 1.2 million ECU.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about the situation in Chechnya have been made known to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions and at the highest level. The Taoiseach expressed our views directly to President Yeltsin on the occasion of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in November. On 8 December, I called in the Russian Ambassador. On 14 January, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I went to Moscow to meet Foreign Minister Ivanov. Minister Ivanov agreed that there had been human rights abuses on both sides and that Russia would have to do everything possible to correct this situation. Yesterday, I reported to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The assembly is debating the issue this week.</P>
    <P>Since the conflict began, the Government has been working actively with EU partners to promote a political solution. In follow-up to the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, the General Affairs Council on 24 January agreed to revise its work plan for the implementation of the common strategy on Russia. It has suspended signature of the scientific and technological agreement with Russia and decided not to carry over 30 million euros of unspent funds for food aid from 1999 to the 2000 budget. It has decided to re-focus the TACIS programme and suspend consideration of additional GSP preferences for Russia. It has also decided that the provisions of the partnership and co-operation agreement should be more strictly implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government noted the agreement of Russia at the OSCE summit in Istanbul that a political solution in Chechnya is essential and that the assistance of the OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal. The Government will continue to work actively to try to persuade Russia to use the facilities of the OSCE and the Council of Europe to bring about a political resolution of the conflict and establish lasting democratic structures in Chechnya.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland Aid has an important and valuable partnership relationship with Irish NGOs as well as with Irish missionary orders active in development and humanitarian relief assistance. This partnership benefits the organisations themselves in terms of financial support for projects and the <Col N="205" /> Ireland aid programme through the experience and contribution of such organisations.</P>
      <P>Support for projects carried out by these organisations is provided under three main funding programmes &ndash; the NGO co-financing scheme, the human rights and democratisation scheme, and the emergency relief and rehabilitation assistance scheme. Organisations can apply for project funding under each of these schemes for different aspects of their activities. Funding arrangements are related to the purpose of the various spending programmes, and not the nature of the recipient organisations NGOs, International organisations, etc.</P>
      <P>In recognition of their capacity and track record, five of the largest Irish NGOs &ndash; Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Christian Aid &ndash; receive an annual block grant from Ireland Aid for development projects. This provides both recipients and Ireland aid greater administrative flexibility and allows block grant recipients freedom to select projects within agreed criteria.</P>
      <P>I believe that no practical purpose would be served by having a separate NGO budget line as it would still be necessary to apply existing criteria in relation to quality, sustainability, accountability, etc. to funding applications. Accordingly, I can see no reason to introduce a separate budget line for NGOs.</P>
      <P>Details of all funding to NGOs are contained in the Ireland Aid annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe committee of experts for the development of human rights has been engaged since March 1998 in drafting a new Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights providing for additional guarantees in the field of equality and non-discrimination to those recognised in Article 14 of the convention.</P>
      <P>The question of the inclusion of sexual orientation along with other prohibitions covered by Article 14 was considered by the committee, which concluded that it would be preferable not to add to the list and to leave unspecified grounds of discrimination such as sexual orientation to be dealt with under the existing catch-all phrase of other status. This decision was not taken because of a lack of awareness that such grounds have become particularly important in today's societies as compared to the time of drafting Article 14 of the convention, but because such additions were considered unnecessary from a legal point of view since the list of non-discrimination grounds in Article 14 is not exhaustive. In addition, it was felt that the existing catch-all clause gave a greater degree of protection to those at risk of discrimination than would a specific reference in the new protocol. This view was based on the fact that member states would not be obliged to become party to the additional protocol and consequently, not being party to the protocol, could claim that they were not obliged to respect sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds for discrimination. Presently all member states are bound by the terms of Article 14 and are therefore obliged by its catch-all clause to accord due respect to sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has received representations on this issue from the National Lesbian and Gay Federation, as well as a number of my parliamentary colleagues, in which Ireland's support for the inclusion of sexual orientation within the draft protocol has been requested. In October 1999, I instructed our representative on the committee of experts to work to ensure that the broadened terms of Article 14 include sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, a final draft text incorporating the views of the European Court of Human Rights and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is due to be released by the committee in the coming months. It will then move to the committee of Minister of the Council for their approval.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184, 186, 187, 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>On 5 January, the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service determined that Juan Gonzalez, the father of Elian Gonzalez, has the sole legal authority to speak for his son on immigration issues and that Elian should be reunited with his father. Before the decision was made, US officials met twice in Cuba with Juan Gonzalez and satisfied themselves that he had a &ldquo;close and continuing relationship with his son&rdquo; and that he was &ldquo;expressing his true wishes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19 January federal district court action was filed in respect of the decision of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service regarding Elian Gonzalez and the matter is now pending before the courts. I warmly welcome the decision of the US authorities that this little boy should be reunited with his father. The US Department of Justice and the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service have made it clear that they are preparing to respond urgently to the pending court action. I earnestly hope that all concerned will keep the <Col N="208" /> best interests of this small boy at the forefront of their concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept and are committed to reaching the UN target for all donors of 0.7% of GNP. We have in addition set an interim target of 0.45% of GNP to be reached in the lifetime of the Government. However, our efforts to make progress to these targets have been complicated by the high growth in GNP since 1996 and also by the recent switch across the EU to a new system of calculating GNP in member states which increases the base GNP figure. Both these developments have adversely affected the trajectory to the UN and interim targets.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the Government is pledged to increasing ODA by significant cash amounts year on year and to making credible progress to the targets. The three year agreement between the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on allocations over 1999, 2000 and 2001 is evidence of the Government's determination on the matter. Negotiations on extending these multi-annual allocations arrangement will commence shortly.</P>

However, Ireland's commitments in other international organisations such as the European Union, the United Nations and the Council of Europe must also be taken into account. For this reason, Ireland has not sought to date to host an OSCE meeting in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194, 195 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns regarding the need to ensure minimum standards in respect of groundhandling services at airports. I have received considerable correspondence on the subject, as have other Ministers and Deputies.</P>
      <P>Regulations to implement the groundhandling directive were signed by me on 16 December 1998. I and officials of my Department have had several meetings with ICTU prior to and since implementation of the directive.</P>
      <P>The directive does not set out any minimum standards with regard to groundhandling services. When airlines use sub contractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility in the first instance to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service provider. In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and they monitor the activities of airlines in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies providing groundhandling services are subject to the health and safety legislation in the normal manner and to the by-laws in force at airports as regards safe working practices. Where <Col N="211" /> the provision of groundhandling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the regional health board's environmental health service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general standards which airport authorities require ground handling companies to meet will be in addition to the regulatory requirements set out above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the three State airports operated by Aer Rianta at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, there are six regional airports located at Donegal, Knock, Galway, Sligo, Kerry and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The Government made Exchequer funding of £5 million available for improvements at the regional airports in Donegal, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Waterford in 1998-99, details of which are given in the following table. Due to delays in land acquisition, Galway airport was unable to complete all of its planned developments and a sum of £2 million of this funding has been rolled over into 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government supports all six of the regional airports through grant schemes to assist in the marketing and promotion of the airports. A total sum in the region of £2.5 million was made available over the period 1996-99 for the scheme. The following table details the funding provided under this scheme to each of the regional airports in the past three years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government also supports the operation of four essential air services routes under an EU regulation, which allows for the imposition of a public service obligation on regional air routes, to improve accessibility and encourage the growth of both industry and tourism related activities. Details of the subvention which has been paid over the last three years to the airlines involved are given in the following table.</P>
      <P>No Exchequer funding is provided for the three State airports. Aer Rianta funds investment at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports from its own resources.</P>

    <P>Iarnrod Éireann have advised that there are no plans at present to extend the ATP to the mainline network as the CAWS system is considered adequate to ensure safe operation taking into account the operating speeds, density of services and the relatively straightforward operating environment on the mainline network.</P>

      <P>The provision of rail services is a matter for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>However, I can say that CIE is being provided with very substantial resources for the maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure and the operation of railway services.</P>
      <P>The national development plan makes provision for an investment of £500 million in mainline rail over the period 2000 to 2006. This includes a sum of £350 million for the continuation of the railway safety programme and a further £150 million for non-safety related investment such as the purchase of new rolling stock, the upgrading of railway stations and the renewal of railway plant and equipment.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding for railway renewal was also provided under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999, assisted by EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin to Waterford line is benefiting significantly from all this investment. The railtrack from Dublin to Kilkenny has already largely been <Col N="214" /> renewed with continuous welded rail and the renewal of the section from Kilkenny to Waterford will be substantially completed under the railway safety programme by 2003. It is hoped to have the signalling on the line converted to the centralised traffic control system by the end of this year. Under the railway safety programme it is planned to upgrade practically all of the track on the Dublin &ndash; Rosslare line to continuously welded rail track by 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition to track renewal substantial investment is being made in the renewal of bridges and fencing and in the upgrading of level crossings. While very good progress is being made in improving the railways, both CIE and myself are in agreement that these improvements need to be continuously built on so that the best possible rail service can be provided for the travelling public.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to facilitate and encourage a wide range of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services to and from airports in Ireland in the interests of Irish tourism, trade and industry.</P>
      <P>Under European Union air transport liberalisation measures, any air carrier licensed by a European economic area &ndash; EEA &ndash; member state &ndash; the 15 member states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland &ndash; may introduce air services on any route within the EEA without any Government or EU controls, subject only to the availability of airport slots at either end of the route and overall safety considerations. As a result, the provision of air services on any particular route is essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of the individual airline.</P>
      <P>At present, British Airways Express operates a daily service from Waterford to Stansted Airport. In addition, British Airways Express also provided a Saturday flight to Manchester last summer and I understand that this service will be provided again this summer. Scotair also provided a weekend service to Luton during the peak 1999 season.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government made funding of £375,000 available in 1998-9 for Waterford Airport for the development of projects including a runway overlay, upgrading of equipment and the provision of a hangar. In addition, Waterford Airport received over £250,000 for marketing and promotion of the airport over the period 1996-9. I propose to provide further assistance this year to the regional airports, including Waterford Airport, for promotion and marketing efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the road haulage industry entitled A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry, published in April 1999, recommended that there should be a more strict application of the road haulage licensing regime. In particular it recommended that my Department should ensure that the requirement of professional competence is strictly enforced and that the transport manager should be involved in the day to day management of the haulage business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU Directive 96/26/EC sets out the criteria for professional competence. This states that where a <Col N="216" /> transport manager is nominated he/she must be engaged to continuously and effectively manage a road haulage operation. The European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations, 1991, implement this requirement for Irish road hauliers  However, over the years, a situation evolved whereby persons who held a certificate of professional competence, but who were not directly involved in the business, were accepted as transport managers.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the review of the industry an implementation group was set up to oversee the implementation of its recommendations. This group comprises representatives of the road haulage division of my Department, IBEC and the Irish Road Haulage Association.</P>
    <P>A new policy governing the designation of transport managers was devised by the road haulage division. In devising this policy particular attention was paid to ensuring that a person nominated as a transport manager continuously and effectively manages the business. The new policy states that in order to comply with the requirement of professional competence an operator must hold a certificate of competence.</P>
    <P>If the operator does not hold this qualification then a transport manager must be employed to manage the business. A person nominated as transport manager cannot hold employment outside the transport business. An exception to this policy is where the spouse/partner of an applicant is nominated as transport manager. In such circumstances the spouse/partner can be in full time employment outside the transport business. This exception is allowed because it is recognised that a spouse/partner would have a direct interest in managing the business.</P>
    <P>One of the main findings in the report of the consultants is that many small firms lack adequate market information, do not have a business plan and appear to do little planning for long-term stability. In this context it is essential that haulage operators themselves possess the necessary professional competence as prescribed by law, or failing this, that they employ a transport manager to continuously and effectively manage their business.</P>
    <P>This new policy was discussed by the implementation group who agreed with its implementation. The IRHA in particular was keen to have this new policy adopted in order to address the problem of &rdquo;phantom managers&rdquo; in the industry and to raise professional standards. The revised policy was put in place on 11 November 1999. The revised policy on transport managers applies only to new entrants to the road haulage industry. Existing licence holders are not affected by the change.</P>
    <P>I am strongly committed to implementing in full the recommendations contained in the review of the road haulage industry and I consider that the revised policy on transport managers is an essential ingredient of that process. My aim is to develop a strong and vibrant Irish haulage indus<Col N="217" /> try which will have the ability to compete successfully in a very demanding market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 1995, Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain a cost-effective and efficient gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions of the transmission system require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively within the day-to-day responsibilities of the board.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries to BGE which informed me that it has carried out an assessment on the viability of extending the existing gas network to Callan, County Kilkenny. Extending the gas grid to Callan would involve the installation of a transmission 70 bar to 4 bar reduction station and feeder and distribution mains resulting in a considerable capital investment.</P>
      <P>The demand for natural gas in Callan is too limited to justify the financial outlay involved. Therefore, BGE cannot extend the gas grid to Callan at this time. However, the board has assured me that, if the potential market for natural gas in Callan were to increase significantly, BGE will reassess the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the discomfort passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times. There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes.</P>
      <P>The Government has recognised the problems facing commuters in the greater Dublin area and responded by approving the purchase of 26 additional DART units and 47 suburban railcars. Two DART units have already been delivered this month and a further eight will be delivered by the end of February 2000. The remaining 16 will be delivered towards the end of this year. Twenty seven of the railcars have also been delivered and the remaining 20 will be delivered towards the end of next year. Of the 27 railcars delivered 14 have already been put in operation on the northern suburban rail line.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out the Government's plans for large scale investment in public transport over the period from 2000 to 2006. This includes substantial expenditure on the acquisition of 58 additional suburban railcars and 46 additional DART cars over the life of the plan. This ongoing investment will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the difficulties with regard to overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> However, I have no statutory function in relation to overcrowding of public transport vehicles. Responsibility for ensuring safety on these vehicles rests with CIE and its subsidiaries. It is, therefore, a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
    <P>I advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding on trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that an independent appraisal of the carrying capacity of all of its rolling stock is to be undertaken to ensure that the carriages are fit for their purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to the issue of having military service allowance (MSA) included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces' personnel who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of MSA in the calculation of superannuation benefits for military personnel arose from a recommendation made in 1990 by the commission on remuneration and conditions of service in the defence forces the Gleeson commission. The agreed arrangements for the implementation of the recommendation provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, that is, the day following publication of the commission's report. MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified persons who retired since that date.</P>
      <P>The various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 were fully considered in the context of the detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations which preceded the implementation of the recommendation of the Gleeson commission. However, having regard to the practice followed in other areas of the public service and the considerable cost involved, which is not confined to my Department alone, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to those who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
      <P>It is a core element of public service pensions parity policy that, when an allowance is being made pensionable for serving personnel, the benefit does not apply to existing pensioners. Accordingly, the stance adopted on the pensionability of MSA is consistent with settled pensions policy in the public service generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to my coming into office, I met in November 1997 with representatives of the Association for Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO). I listened carefully and sympathetically to their views on this issue and I undertook to have the matter re-examined. I was conscious, however, that the situation regarding pre-August 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners involved fundamental issues of policy and cost which are not <Col N="222" /> confined to my Department alone. While my Department initiated this re-examination, it became clear that it would be inappropriate to proceed any further pending the publication of the final report of the commission on public service pensions.</P>
    <P>The commission on public service pensions was established by the Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The commission has very broad terms of reference to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits. It was open to individuals and groups to make submissions to the commission and I understand that ARCO, together with the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women and the Irish UN Veterans Association, were among various pensioners' groups to do so.</P>
    <P>The commission is an independent body and is expected to make its final report to Government soon. In its interim report published in November 1997, the commission lists the pensionability of allowances generally as one of the main issues raised by various interested parties who made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard. The position of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners in the MSA context will be further considered in light of the final report of the commission and of any relevant Government decisions thereon.</P>

      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy Barracks, will be evacuated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition <Col N="224" /> to those initial meetings, I met with members of the Oireachtas and local councillors in relation to Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February, 3 March, and 15 July 1999; local councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on 3 March and 10 March 1999 in relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas, and I have met with councillors and an official of Kildare County Council on 14 September 1999 in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare.</P>
    <P>Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December 1998 in relation to Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with members of Fermoy Urban District Council and officials of Cork County Council on 26 October 1999, I indicated to them that I had decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker agreement has been completed by the North Eastern Health Board under which they will be allowed to occupy the property immediately.</P>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May 1999. A tender competition was held in October 1999 for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the property. It is proposed to appoint selling agents in the near future following which the sale of the barracks will proceed.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. A number of the proposals received have been shortlisted and those consultants placed on the shortlist have been invited to make presentations before a selection committee prior to final selection. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>The independent consultants appointed to <Col N="225" /> draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as an integral part of their commission. The integrated plan for the future development of the property is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks.</P>

      <P>The plan envisaged that the Defence Forces Training Centre at the Curragh would be served by a more limited military medical facility focusing mainly on outpatient medical services, including routine pharmacy and dental services, together with a limited five day &ldquo;infirmary&rdquo; type inpatient facility.</P>
      <P>The military medical facility at the Defence Forces Training Centre was never intended to provide acute general hospital services. In addition, numerous legal and insurance issues would need to be addressed before such a proposal could be considered.</P>

As the person named does not occupy and farm lands designated as disadvantaged he is not eligible for grants under the headage schemes.  In any event, no application was received from the person named under the headage schemes.</P>
      <P>The person named made one 1999 special beef premium application. This application was received on 11 August 1999 and listed a total of 18 animals. This application is the subject of a field inspection and a decision regarding payment will be made when the result is known.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 15 December 1999, one of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 1999 area aid application overlaps with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. Both herdowners have been written to, with a view to resolving the problem and the herdowner's response is now being considered.</P>
      <P>In addition an overclaim was identified on one of the land parcels claimed by the person named. Maps have issued to him and he has also been informed of the extent of this overclaim.</P>
      <P>No further payments can issue until these matters have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £1,595.50 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 15 December 1999. This payment was based on forage area of 25.51 hectares. When the issues concerning his 1999 area aid application are resolved, his entitlement under this scheme will be recalculated.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, his Department is taking to harmonise the procedure obtaining for the importation of a pet dog or cat from other EU countries in line with the prevailing procedure for importation in other EU countries; the minimum guarantee period applicable in the EU; the reason his Department insists on a six month guarantee period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is concerned about rabies controls.</P>
      <P>There are no harmonised rules at EU level, governing the procedures for the importation of a pet dog or cat from other EU countries. The controls which Ireland, in common with the UK, has operated for many years are based on a quarantine requirement, which provides that pet dogs or cats entering Ireland other than from the UK including Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man must undergo a period of six months quarantine. This requirement was determined, on the basis of the best scientific advice available, by the likely incubation period for rabies and reflected the need to afford the public adequate protection against the threat of rabies being introduced into Ireland by animals from countries in which there continued to be confirmed cases of rabies in significant numbers. The evidence suggests that this has been a correct and effective approach to take in the relevant circumstances. The commonality of approach as between Ireland and the UK which has hitherto been maintained, reflects the practical reality of the land border between both jurisdictions and the volume and frequency of travel between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, the development of new control methods for rabies and a marked reduction in the numbers of confirmed rabies cases in western Europe has led in certain instances to calls for the traditional approach to rabies control to be reviewed, specifically in so far as quarantine requirements are concerned. In response to public pressure in the UK, and on foot of a report (the Kennedy report) by an expert group which had been established to examine the matter, the UK Government has decided to dispense, with effect from early 2001 and in respect of pets from certain EU and other countries, with the quarantine requirement in favour of a system based on animal identification, vaccination, blood testing and certification. In so far as Ireland has hitherto <Col N="230" /> maintained a common approach with the UK, this decision clearly had implications for Ireland's rabies control regime.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, the UK authorities have also decided to run a pilot of the proposed new regime at the end of February 2000. This will apply only to pet dogs and cats entering or re-entering the UK from EU member states and some other European countries. Pets qualifying for entry into the UK under this pets pilot scheme will be obliged to travel along certain approved routes and with carriers approved for such routes.</P>
    <P>In the context of the common approach which we have hitherto maintained with the UK and to avoid the operational anomalies which would otherwise arise, I will shortly be seeking the approval of the Government to make an appropriate limited adjustment to Ireland's current quarantine regime in order to allow pet dogs and cats which have first entered the UK (including Northern Ireland), the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man under the conditions of the UK pilot scheme to enter Ireland without the need to undergo quarantine. In all other respects, the conditions of Ireland's current quarantine regime will continue for the time being to apply.</P>
    <P>In due course, subject to further necessary elements of consultation and assessment having been completed and experience of the UK pilot scheme, I would envisage recommending to the Government that Ireland's rabies control regime should be changed, with effect from early 2001, from a quarantine-based regime to one based on identification, vaccination, blood-testing and certification in respect of pet dogs and cats entering Ireland from EU member states and a number of other specified low-risk jurisdictions. It would obviously be sensible to ensure that any such changes could come into operation simultaneously with those proposed in the UK.</P>
    <P>My primary concern in considering this question has been and remains the protection of public and animal health in Ireland. My Department will continue to work closely with the UK authorities to ensure that any new arrangements for the control of rabies offer the necessary assurances both to the Government and the public in this regard.</P>

      <P>Under the Dúchas compensation scheme for ewes culled under the ewe supplementary measure, 1998 the rates of payment were fixed at £25 for the loss of each premium under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, £11 for the loss of each grant under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and £2 for each ewe culled. The maximum payable on any ewe was therefore £38. According to my Department's records for the 1999 schemes the person named was at the loss of 13 ewe premia for which he received £25 each, nine sheep headage grants at £11 each.

      <P>The person named applied for a total of 3.84 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 3.5 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.34 hectares or 9.71% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. In this case therefore a penalty of 0.68 hectares has to apply, leaving the area at 2.82 hectares.

      <P>The person named applied for a total of 30.99 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 30.24 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.75 hectares or 2.48% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. In this case therefore no penalty is applied. Based on his forage area of 30.24 hectares, payment of £1,857 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme has now issued. Payments of his entitlements under the 1999 suckler cow scheme, amounting to £718.95 and £63.81 under the euro compensation scheme will issue tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 257 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heavy rains in December and January resulted in extensive flooding in the Shannon catchment area as well as in some western counties. The <Col N="238" /> threat of flooding has been a feature of farming especially in the Shannon basin, for many years and despite several studies and remedial plans in the past the danger of serious flooding occurring in the future remains. While some farmers have incurred fodder losses as a result of the recent flooding, the general level of fodder stocks entering the winter were satisfactory. Accordingly, I have no plans for a special fodder compensation scheme. The underlying recurring problem of Shannon flooding needs to be addressed by the formulation of comprehensive measures involving all the official agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the Dúchas compensation scheme for ewes culled under the ewe supplementary measure, 1998, the rates of payment were fixed at £25 for the loss of each premium under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, £11 for the loss of each grant under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and £2 for each ewe culled. The maximum payable on any ewe was therefore £38. According to my Department's records for the 1999 schemes the person named was at the loss of five ewe premia for which he received £25 each, and 11 sheep headage grants at £11 each. He also received £2 for each of the nine ewes that he actually culled in 1998. His total entitlement was therefore £264.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999 of the eligibility criteria for the allocation of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota that becomes available from 1 April 2000. Fifteen million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota.  A further 5 million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme for the allocation of the 15 milion gallons is being administered by the dairy co-operatives on the basis of criteria set by me.  On <Col N="241" /> the basis of the information available to my Department the person named does not meet all of the eligibility criteria for these schemes and therefore is not entitled to an allocation.</P>
    <P>I will announce details in due course for the allocation of the remaining 500,000 gallons that has been set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution and if the person named qualifies under that scheme he may apply at that stage.</P>

      <P>The additional documentation submitted by the person named has been reviewed, and the area aid unit has accepted that he made a genuine error in completing his application. The claimed total on his 1998 area aid application was 28.13 hectares, but this has now been reduced to an amended figure of 22.96 hectares. Following processing of his application an area of 21.58 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.38 hectares or 6.39% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. In this case therefore a penalty of 2.76 hectares has to apply, leaving the area at 18.82 hectares and the person named has received his full entitlement under the 1999 sheep headage scheme.</P>

At this inspection it was found that Parcel No. D26504025 was overclaimed by 0.79 hectares. The area found at inspection was 39.79 hectares. This represents a difference of .79 hectares or 1.98% between the area claimed and that found. Under <Col N="243" /> Article 9 of EU Regulations 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. The applicant was paid on 39.79 hectares under the 1999 arable aid scheme.</P>
      <P>Parcel No. D26407026 with a net area of 3.16 hectares was a duplicate claim and was deleted without penalty. No amendment form was received from the person named in relation to parcel No. D26504013. The last day for amendments to 1999 area aid applications was 15 May 1999.</P>

      <P>The position is that the White Paper on Rural Development was launched over five months ago, in August 1999. The White Paper sets out a vision and framework for the development of rural communities and marks a new approach and commitment by Government to rural development. One of the concerns is to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside. To maintain viable rural communities we must exploit our natural advantages and potential to the full in the creation of more opportunities for enterprise both on and off farm.</P>
      <P>The rural development policy agenda is defined in the White Paper as all Government policies and interventions which are directed towards improving the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in the open countryside, coastal areas, towns and villages and smaller urban centres outside of the five major urban areas. The agenda will, at the same time, facilitate balanced and sustainable regional development while tackling issues of poverty and social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development, and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion. There are also commitments to the preservation of the culture and heritage of rural areas and protecting the environment.</P>
      <P>The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of £6.7 billion over the next seven years in actions which directly impact on rural areas.</P>

      <P>The person named made the following applications for special beef premium: &ndash; five animals on 22 April 1999; five animals on 11 November 1999 and 27 animals on 23 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The person named also made a suckler cow application for 60 Cows on 27 May 1999.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium and suckler cow schemes, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. The person named declared 23.03 forage hectares on his area aid application and is therefore entitled to payment on a maximum of 46.06 reckonable livestock units. Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by the applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.</P>
      <P>The first Special Beef Premium application utilises 4.6 livestock units. His suckler cow application utilises the remaining 41.46 livestock units. No further payment can therefore issue.</P>
      <P>Payment for five special beef premium animals totalling £256.83 was issued to the person named on 1 November 1999. Payment of £3,256.02 under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme was issued to the person named on 23 December 1999 and a suckler cow euro compensation payment of £288.99 also issued to the person named on 23 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The EU regulations governing these schemes specifically provide that animals applied on in excess of the individual herdowner's permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to have been paid the instalment applied for. As far as the special beef premium scheme is concerned these animals are specifically excluded from qualifying from that instalment of premium at a future date. Withdrawal of applications is not permitted in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>Grant aid was available to horse breeders through a number of quality breeding schemes under the EU co-financed <Col N="249" /> Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994 to 1999. Payments under these schemes are ongoing this year but only on claims which were lodged with my Department and in respect of which my Department had entered into commitments before 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Proposals for funding for further grants schemes for the benefit of horse breeders and the infrastructure within which such breeding takes place, farm improvement grants for housing and handling facilities for horses and assistance for training for the horse industry for the period 2000 to 2006 have been put forward as part of the national development plan for the development of the horse industry. Details of all the schemes will be announced when the plan has been approved by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The equine headage scheme applies in the areas of the country designated as more severely handicapped, less severely handicapped and as coastal areas with specific handicaps, the disadvantaged areas. The scheme operates annually. A specific application period, with opening and closing dates, is set by my Department and application forms are posted to applicants who were in the scheme in previous years.</P>
      <P>Grants are paid on breeding mares which are registered in the applicant's name in the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society or in the Irish Horse Register. Rates of payment are £70 per mare on the first eight eligible mares and £66 per mare on the next 22 eligible mares.</P>
      <P>To qualify for grants, an applicant must be a registered herdowner aged 18 years or over; occupy and farm at least 3 hectares in a disadvantaged area; undertake to continue in farming in a disadvantaged area for at least five years from the date of first payment under any disadvantaged area scheme and satisfy my Department that he or she is in a position to honour this undertaking; have submitted a valid area aid application for the year of equine headage scheme application; undertake to keep the mares on which headage grants are being claimed for a minimum of two calendar months from the day after the date of receipt of the application by my Department; supply his or her RSI number if applying for total headage payments of more than £500 in any calendar year.</P>
      <P>The above is a summary of the detailed terms and conditions which apply to the equine headage scheme and I have arranged for copies of the application form and terms and conditions for this year's scheme to be sent to the Deputy when they become available in April 2000.</P>

      <P>No evidence has been made available to my Department confirming the existence of a cartel in operation among the meat factories. In April 1997, my predecessor requested the Competition Authority to look into this matter but I understand that no conclusive evidence has been uncovered which would support a charge of anti-competitive practices. However, the Government has decided to appoint a committee of independent experts to examine all allegations of anti-competitive practices within the industry. The committee is to submit its report within three months.</P>

      <P>I understand that the person in question submitted an application for additional quota from the milk quota appeals tribunal. His case was considered at a meeting of the tribunal on 22 November 1999 but it was not among those for which an allocation was recommended. The person named has been notified of the outcome of his application. The tribunal is not in a position to re-examine this case during the current milk quota year but he may apply again when application forms become available for the 2000/2001 milk quota year. These application forms will be available from milk purchasers and from the milk policy division of my Department after 1 April 2000.</P>
      <P>From the information available in my Department it would appear that the person named will not qualify for an allocation under the scheme for the allocation of five million gallons to younger dairy farmers as his permanent quota at 31 March 1999 exceeded 35,000 gallons.</P>

One of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 1999 area aid application overlaps with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant.

      <P>The person named applied for 23 suckler cows under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and for 23 beef cows under the 1999 beef cow scheme on 26 May 1999. At an on-farm inspection carried out on 30 September 1999 it was established that the person named applied on one animal that was not in his ownership and possession on the date of application. In addition, it was also established that the person named applied on an animal that was deemed to be a heifer and was therefore ineligible for the suckler cow premium scheme or the beef cow scheme. Consequently, the person named was deemed to have made a false declaration through serious negligence which means that under the regulations he has no entitlement to payment under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and the 1999 beef cow scheme.</P>

    <P>The applicant was notified of the decision by letter on 27 October 1999.

      <P>The person named applied for a total of 88.86 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area 74.32 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 14.54 hectares or 19.56% between the area claimed and that determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20% a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case, a penalty of 29.08 hectares has to apply, leaving the area on which payments are based at 45.24 hectares which would entitle the person named to payment on the max of 200 sheep. He has already been paid in respect of 102 sheep and a payment on the balance of 98 sheep will issue shortly.</P>

Recurring schemes such as headage and premium schemes as well as national reserves are not advertised in local newspapers as it is considered that the market penetration of the specific farming newspapers is such that local advertising is not warranted.</P>

      <P>As stated in my replies to previous parliamentary questions in this case, one of the parcels claimed by this person on his 1998 area aid application was also being claimed by another herdowner. Letters accompanied by maps issued to both herdowners with a view to resolving the dispute. The other herdowner involved provided proof of his entitlement to claim the parcel in question. This reduced the area found to 6.46 hectares. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92 as the difference was greater than 20%, a 100% penalty was applicable to his 1998 application.</P>
      <P>However a review of the map that the person named submitted reveals that he should in fact have claimed a parcel of land directly adjacent to the dual claimed parcel. In the particular circumstances of this case, the area aid unit is prepared to regard the dual claim as an obvious error on the part of the person named and to allow the parcel concerned to be added to his application.</P>
      <P>The application has now been fully processed on this basis and any outstanding payments due will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999 the eligibility criteria for the allocation of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota that becomes available from 1 April 2000. Fifteen million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect.</P>
      <P>The scheme for the allocation of the 15 million gallons is being administered by the dairy co-operatives on the basis of criteria set by me. On the basis of the information available to my Department the person named does not meet all of the eligibility criteria for these schemes and therefore, is not entitled to an allocation.</P>
      <P>I will however, announce details in due course for the allocation of the remaining 500,000 gallons that has been set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution and if the person named qualifies under that scheme he may apply at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331, 333 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in my December 1998 budget, I introduced a new rate of vehicle registration tax &ndash; 30% &ndash; for larger motor vehicles. I said, at the time, that I believed that it was appropriate to seek to recoup revenue in this way from a sector that was experiencing record sales, to meet the additional road use and environmental damage arising from the unprecedented growth in private car usage. I also reduced the excise duty on automotive liquid petroleum gas.</P>
      <P>In my most recent budget, I announced that it is proposed that the existing tax concession given to the CIE group of companies and to certain other operators in respect of the diesel used in public transport operations would, in future, be confined to the use of ultra low sulphur diesel. Provision for this will be made in the forthcoming Finance Bill and the relevant sections will be implemented by way of a ministerial order. This is being done to give operators an opportunity to set up the necessary operational arrangements and I hope that this significantly cleaner product will soon be in use by public transport operators.</P>
      <P>I have also said that it was intended to take up the issue of green tax policy with the social partners in the context of the successor to Partnership 2000 with a view to putting in place an agreed policy in this area in view of the impact of tax increases on inflation and those on low incomes. As the Deputy is aware, discussions on a successor to Partnership 2000 are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to carbon tax, I assume that the Deputy is actually referring to the proposals on the Taxation of Energy Products which the EU Commission published in March 1997 and not to the earlier EU proposals relating to carbon energy tax. The latter are not being actively pursued by the EU Commission, but have not been formally withdrawn either. The proposed energy tax directive suggested both increased taxes on items such as petrol and proposes new taxes on coal, gas and electricity. There were also complex arrangements to assist energy intensive industries with both obligatory and optional provisions for relief from the tax suggested. EU Excise Directives already require minimum rates for taxes on mineral oils, but taxes on electricity, natural gas or on coal etc. are not required. Ireland does not impose any additional excise taxes on natural gas, electricity, coal or turf. The Commission proposal provided for a three phased increase in existing <Col N="269" /> mineral oil tax minima, the first of which was to have come into effect on 1 January 1998, the second on 1 January 2000. EU excises are expressed as minima and no upper limit is generally specified.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns, with regard to the energy tax directive, relate to our peripheral status, the greater dispersal of population which adds to transport costs and the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU versus third countries. My particular concern as Minister for Finance is to ensure that any measures advanced to promote energy saving do not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have very low taxes on energy. I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such energy tax would have on the Consumer Price Index and how increased tax and new taxes would impact on the less well off members of the community. I have indicated, however, that I am prepared to participate in discussion in a positive way.</P>
    <P>At the European Council summit in Cologne in June 1999, direction was given for a continuation of work on the framework proposals, bearing in mind the impact any agreement may have on the environment. While little progress on the issue was made during the Finnish Presidency, my officials and I look forward to working with the Portuguese Presidency during its term of office.</P>
    <P>Given the implications for international competitiveness, it is more likely that any major changes in the area of carbon taxes will be taken in the context of international initiatives rather than on the basis of unilateral action by individual member states.</P>

    <P>*Provisional.</P>
    <P>The level of indebtedness has been falling in recent years due to the running of Exchequer surpluses and this decline is expected to continue in the medium term.</P>
    <P>The increase in the debt between 1998 and 1999 reflects the accounting effect of the securities exchange programme and the absorption of FEOGA debt IR£375 million into the national debt. The Securities Exchange Programme was carried out by the NTMA in 1999 in order to ensure the competitiveness of Irish Government bonds in the new euro trading environment. Under the programme old bonds with a high interest coupon were exchanged for a larger amount of new bonds with a lower interest coupon close to current market rates. If the impact of these exceptional items is excluded the debt would have fallen by circa IR£1,360 million. However, the increase in debt due to the programme will be compensated for by a reduction in debt service costs as lower coupons are paid on the increased amount of debt. In other words, the market value of the debt is not affected by the exchange of bonds. The overall effect of the programme is that the Exchequer should be able to raise funds at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that part &ndash; £2.417 billion &ndash; of the Telecom receipts and interest realised of £16 million were placed in 1999 into a temporary holding fund pending transfer to the proposed new funds designed to meet future state pension liabilities. Furthermore an annual contribution of 1% of GNP &ndash; £582 million in 1999 &ndash; beginning in 1999 is being set aside towards these future costs. Thus a total of £3.016 billion was lodged to the temporary holding fund in 1999. This amount is not reflected in the figures set out above.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no immediate plans to introduce a compensation package in respect of those <Col N="275" /> affected by the recent flooding along the river Shannon, I and my colleagues in Government are keeping the situation under review and, where necessary, will bring forward appropriate measures.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge the range of agencies with interests in and responsibilities for the river, I think that at this stage the interests of those affected by the flooding would be better served through increased co-operation of the part of those agencies rather than necessarily establishing a further statutory authority. In keeping the situation under review I will be looking for evidence of this improved co-operation in the future.</P>
    <P>I would point out that there is a proposed EU Framework Directive on Water Policy which will require that all aspects of water management be addressed on an integrated basis in relation to river basins. When the directive has been adopted it will be necessary to draw up comprehensive water management plans and put arrangements in place in relation to the co-ordination of all aspects of water management. These plans will, in relation to the management of water resources, include measures to relieve the effects of flood and drought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from the individual in Dublin 6 in relation to capital acquisitions tax, CAT. As I outlined in response to parliamentary questions last year, I have been aware for some time of the tax burden facing some individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the home where they have been residing.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the CAT code, I addressed these difficulties in the recent budget and introduced a family home relief for CAT purposes. CAT will no longer apply on the transfer of the home on or after 1 December 1999 provided it is the principal private residence of the disponer and/or the recipient and the recipient has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer. It will also be a condition that the recipient does not have an interest in any other residential property. These conditions will be confirmed in the Finance Bill which will be published next month. The Finance Bill will also provide that the recipient must own and reside in the house for six years after the transfer. This condition will not apply to recipients over 55 years of age and provision will be made for those circumstances where the recipient is unable to comply with the residence requirements for reasons outside their control, for example, due to hospitalisation or work obligations. This residence condition is a change from the budget announcement where the condition was that the recipient does not dispose of the home for six years after the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these particular measures should remove the tax burden on the home for many people in the future, including those in family <Col N="278" /> and personal relationships who are otherwise treated as strangers under the capital acquisitions tax law.</P>

      <P>The revenue job assist scheme was introduced in April 1998 to complement the wide range of schemes already available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two-part initiative that gives employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone else in the labour market. Under the terms of the scheme the long-term unemployed person also qualifies for a special tax allowance over a three year period.</P>
      <P>However, the revenue job assist allowance does not apply to jobs which are already grant aided by other agencies statutory, or otherwise, or which are supported under existing employment schemes such as the back to work allowance scheme, administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, or Jobstart administered by FÁS.</P>
      <P>On 27 October 1999, the person concerned made an application for the revenue job assist allowance on commencing employment. In the form, he indicated that he had previously been in receipt of unemployment assistance and was now in receipt of a back to work allowance of £47.30 per week, both of which are paid to him by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. His claim was refused on the grounds that he is already benefiting under an employment scheme in respect of the particular job which he took up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Report No. 37 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended significant changes in the system of remuneration for chief executives of commercial State bodies, to be linked to changes in contract arrangements, performance-related pay, publication of remuneration information and corporate governance.</P>
      <P>In relation to corporate governance, the review body concluded that the system of selection and remuneration of directors would require review in order to ensure that each board had sufficient directors with the particular expertise required to enable them to serve meaningfully on a remuneration sub-committee. To this end, it specifically recommended that:</P>
      <P>appointments to the boards should be made solely on the basis of the experiences, competence and expertise of the persons concerned;</P>
      <P>there should be an appropriate number of executive directors; as a first step, chief executives should be appointed to the boards; each board should have a suitable civil servant appointed to it;</P>
      <P>revised arrangements should be introduced to give chairpersons a greater role in the appointment of all other new directors; and</P>
      <P>the timing and duration of board appointments should be structured to avoid expiry of the terms of office of a large number of directors at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided, in March 1998, to implement the review body's recommendations on the remuneration of chief executives of commercial State bodies, subject to some modifications. The review body had recommended an initial evaluation and annual reviews by each such board whereby, with the assistance of common pay consultants appointed by the Minister for Finance, basic salary would be derived from comparison of the chief executive job with jobs of comparable size across the private sector. To introduce greater co-ordination, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance should <Col N="282" /> appoint pay consultants to evaluate all relevant chief executive posts in one exercise, analyse rates for jobs of comparable size across the private sector and submit a framework to the Minister for Finance, on the basis of which he would bring proposals to Government as to the rate to apply to each commercial State body chief executive. Hay Management Consultants were appointed as pay consultants.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Minister for Finance's proposals, the Government decided, in July 1999, that increases in remuneration for individual chief executives could be applied in line with the Minister for Finance's framework, based on the Hay report. Such increases would be strictly conditional on the State body and its chief executive accepting the recommendations of the review body on the nature of contracts, performance-related pay and the publication of remuneration information in annual accounts.</P>
    <P>At that stage, the Government did not implement the other recommended changes in corporate governance and related issues. The Minister nonetheless considers that the eventual implementation of those recommendations would make a positive contribution to the quality of strategic management in the commercial State sector and intends making further proposals to the Government on those aspects at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a non-taxable allowance. However, an individual in receipt of disability allowance is liable to income tax on other income, including income derived from rehabilitation part-time work. Tax is computed in the normal manner and the individual will have entitlement to the normal tax free allowances.</P>
      <P>Where the other earnings of an individual in receipt of disability allowance exceed £50 per week, it is regarded as an employment for pay related social insurance contributions, PRSI, purposes. The normal contribution rules apply, as follows: the employer pays a contribution based on the total income, and the employee pays a contribution based on the total income. However, the first £100 of income is exempt from the pay related social insurance contribution.</P>

      <P>The position is that the officer concerned was recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin, where she was appointed as a clerical officer in October, 1999. As a new entrant, she is expected by the Revenue Commissioners to serve for a period of two years before being considered for transfer to another location. The officer was notified in writing of this condition in advance of taking up duty in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin.</P>
      <P>While the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has every sympathy with the personal difficulties which the individual in question is experiencing, any exception to normal, agreed, practice in relation to transfer lists would give rise to considerable unrest and, potentially, complaints from others on the list who would have been displaced and may feel that their personal circumstances are equally deserving of exceptional treatment.</P>
      <P>When the two year period has been completed, and should the officer's place on a transfer list be reached, the officer may then be considered for transfer. The application for transfer has already been noted and forwarded to departments with offices in relevant locations.</P>

      <P>The Irish League of Credit Union's pre-budget submission makes a number of proposals regarding the taxation of credit unions, including seeking the implementation of the proposals of the chairman of the working group on the taxation of credit union savings. The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October 1998. Early last year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. I understand that a formal complaint has been made to the EU Commission regarding the tax status of credit unions in Ireland. The complaint alleges that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of its exemption from corporation tax and its exemption from DIRT. The complaint asserts that this treatment of credit unions in Irish taxation law is contrary to EU law. I understand that the EU Commission is in the course of investigating this complaint. In view of these developments, I am unable to introduce any changes to the legislation in this regard at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability has been a priority for me. In this regard, I have allocated substantial additional funding towards the development of these services, totalling £53 million up to the end of 1999. While this funding has made a significant impact on the development of services, I am aware that waiting lists in this area have continued to grow. The Government is committed to clearing this backlog over the next three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment, both capital and revenue, in 2000.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding being allocated in 2000 is designed to support the development of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. Given the timeframe involved in bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, rising to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding will provide 555 new residential places; 185 new respite places; 700 new day places; health related support services for persons with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements; and additional specialist and other support services. There is also a need for capital investment in the infrastructure required to support these services. One of my first actions on taking office was to put in place a dedicated national capital programme, to provide an initial capital investment of £30 million for the period 1998-2001, with a further allocation of £5 million in 1998 for a maintenance and refurbishment programme for existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan now provides a new framework within which unprecedented capital investment will be made in the health services in the period from 2000-06. In the area of intellectual disability services, this investment will focus on three main areas: the provision of new facilities from which a broad range of support services, including residential, respite and day services, can be delivered; the renovation of existing facilities and the continuation of the programme <Col N="287" /> to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements. Additional capital funding of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and £10 million in 2002. This is a total of £80 million over the next three years, to support these developments.</P>
    <P>This additional funding brings the total revenue and capital funding provided by me to date for these services to £121.7 million in 2000, with a full year cost of £128.7 million in 2001. This underlines the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of persons with an intellectual disability and I wish to assure you that this will remain one of my top priorities.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the waiting times for assessment in inter-country adoptions in the Eastern Health Board area are at an acceptable level and that immediate action needs to be taken to deal with the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1142/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave to the House on 23 November and 14 December 1999 in relation to the waiting times for assessment for inter-country adoption at the end of 1998. I have previously informed the House of the additional £213,000 which was allocated to the Eastern Health Board in mid-1999 following the publication of the report Towards a Standardised <Col N="291" /> Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures. A further £500,000 has been allocated to the health boards in the year 2000 on the basis of waiting lists at end September, 1999 and £236,000 of the total has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board. The total additional funding for the Eastern Health Board over this period therefore amounts to £449,000, which represents almost a doubling of the budget for inter-country adoption services.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that the standardised framework approach, set out in the report on assessment procedures, will be commencing this month through the provision of the new format preparation courses. In addition, the board has made arrangements for the provision of improved accommodation, information technology and administrative support for inter-country adoption services. These initiatives should help to streamline the assessment process and increase throughput. Together with an increased complement of social workers these measures should bring about a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed in the board in 2000.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that the recruitment of social workers is a particular difficulty in the Eastern Health Board and that adverse media attention on the inter-country adoption service has undoubtedly been a contributing factor. Despite other initiatives which the board has taken to improve the service to applicants for inter-country adoption, the availability, recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified staff will be a key element in bringing waiting times to an acceptable level. It should be noted that the board is in regular contact with parent representative groups involved in inter-country adoption who are being kept fully informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing legislation adoption assessments may be carried out by health boards and adoption societies registered with the Adoption Board. Any society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act, 1952, sections 34 to 39, as amended, which prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. One such society, PACT, is currently carrying out assessments for inter-country adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accreditation of competent bodies, for example, adoption agencies/societies, to undertake certain tasks such as assessment for inter-country adoption will be considered in the context of the proposed legislation to ratify the Hague Convention. I should point out that in view of the recent increases in staff assigned to <Col N="292" /> inter-country adoption assessment, as well as the introduction of a standardised framework for assessment, there should be a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed during this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 482 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is already a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. As I outlined to the House on 20 October and 9 November 1999, the ratification of the Hague Convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. Work is continuing in my Department on the preparation of the legislation to ratify the convention. The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. Accordingly, a child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken to the preparation of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to future policy regarding recognition of non-convention adoptions after the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention has been introduced. This issue is not covered by the actual provisions of the Hague Convention. I have already indicated that it is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. However, I would like to emphasise that the matter is still under examination and final decisions in regard to this matter have not yet been taken.</P>

      <P>The funding of voluntary sector service organisations, such as the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, providing services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the health boards. I understand that the organisation is in contact with the relevant boards about funding for the services it provides to its members. I have made £7 million &ndash; £14 million full cost on 2001 &ndash; available to the health boards this year for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. The boards will decide on priorities for the allocation of this funding in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and people with disabilities themselves are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>The financial deficit accumulated by the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus is a problem experienced by a number of organisations in the sector. I propose to take steps to establish the precise sum required to discharge these deficits and to seek funding to enable me to do so. At this stage I have no guarantee that such funding will be available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386, 390, 428, 454 and 463 together.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would jus<Col N="295" /> tify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service. The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the Government has provided a total of £66.985 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments. This year £7 million development funding has been allocated for ser<Col N="296" /> vices for people with physical and sensory disabilities, rising to £14 million in the year 2001. This funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services. To this end, I have targeted £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2001, for home support services, which includes personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to introduce an independent living fund, as proposed by the Centre for Independent Living, as a means of funding the personal assistance service. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service agencies, including centres for independent living and service users are represented on these committees.</P>

      <P>Planning for the Future, published in 1984, recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community oriented, and that there should be a shift from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the mental health services. Successive Governments have pursued this policy and the shift from an institutional setting to a community-based setting has resulted in many improvements in our mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim at all times is to provide each individual patient with the best possible care in the most appropriate setting. Community care is not always the most suitable method of care and in a small number of cases long-term inpatient treat<Col N="297" /> ment is required.  The discharge of any patient from a psychiatric hospital is a clinical decision and patients are only discharged when their clinical condition warrants it. Care is taken to ensure that homeless patients are not discharged without appropriate alternative accommodation being available to them.</P>
    <P>There appears to be no evidence to attribute the relatively high degree of psychiatric illness among the prison population to the shift to a community based mental health service. Additional funding has been made available to the health boards this year for substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatric services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 394 and 480 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide that An t-Ard Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to copies of entries identified from the indexes. However, this is only one aspect of the services provided at the General Register Office, Joyce House, and other services provided include the issue of authorisations for the late registration of events and the reregistration of births. In addition, An t-Ard Chláraitheoir is concerned with the appointment of registrars and the administration of marriage law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, steps are being taken to maintain and improve indices to the records of births, deaths and marriages including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indices in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed it will <Col N="298" /> improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indices and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office. Other measures taken to improve services in the General Register Office include the relocation of the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House in July 1999 to provide additional space in the public reading room. Tenders have been sought for the further refurbishment of the General Register Office which will include additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and the improvement of customer services on the second floor of the office. Other issues raised in the council's report are being considered in the context of the review of the service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the board. I understand that the board's consultant orthodontist has been suspended from duty since November 1999. The consultant refused to commence the treatment of new patients since April 1999 and this was one of the difficulties encountered by the health board which led to her suspension. I am currently considering a proposal from the board to terminate the suspension of the consultant orthodontist following her acceptance of a number of conditions laid down by the board.</P>
      <P>The prospective waiting time in the Eastern Health Board for a person who joined the waiting list in December 1999 is four years, those who joined the list in 1998 will wait three years and those listed in 1997 will wait approximately two years.  In other health boards, the current average waiting period for persons on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment is two to four years.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated funding of £1.065 million in late 1999 to facilitate the development of a regional orthodontic unit at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. Planning for this unit is well advanced and it is anticipated that services will come on stream there in the middle of this year. In addition, my Department has recently approved capital funding of £2.6 million for the development of a further regional orthodontic unit at Beaumont Hospital and this unit is expected to come into operation mid to end 2001.  Approval has also been granted for the employment of two additional consultant orthodontists and it is expected that these posts will be advertised by the Local Appointments Commission in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the report Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I established a broad-based working group to advise me on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. It is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, consultant physician in medicine of old age. The terms of reference of the working group are as follows: Having regard to the report entitled Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People; An Exploratory Study published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise the Minister of State with special responsibility for older people on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations in relation to such of the following matters as it considers appropriate: definitions and terminology; identification and screening procedures; assessment protocols and procedures; management of sensitive information; recording and reporting procedures; inter-agency communications and referral practices; intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact; any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures; training of relevant staff in the statutory, <Col N="301" /> voluntary and private sectors; and the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
      <P>The group held its first meeting on 12 October 1999. It has drawn up a comprehensive two year work programme which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes, preparation of evaluation report, and culminating in the presentation of a final report to me. I am providing resources to ensure that the work is completed within the timeframe envisaged.</P>
      <P>It will be clear that this expert working group has a broad remit in relation to making recommendations as to how the problem of elder abuse will best be overcome and I am sure that the Deputy will accept that the precise nature of measures to be taken should await the outcome of the group's deliberations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 to 423, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In the light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. It is, therefore, more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation. A number of important aspects of the role of rehabilitation services are highlighted below and I also have asked the chief executive officer of each health board to write to the Deputy outlining the particular arrangements for the provision of rehabilitation services in each health board area.</P>
      <P>In-patient medical rehabilitation services are required by certain types of patients, such as those seriously injured in accidents and stroke patients and a 123 bed facility for such patients is provided at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, which provides a national medical rehabilitation service. The total cost of this service in 2000 is £9.069 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute <Col N="306" /> hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>As part of a package of measures to address these problems the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Dublin acute hospitals, which provide accident and emergency services, were asked to examine this particular aspect of the service and to formulate a response. The board submitted a comprehensive action plan which takes into account the complex group of patients who need a mixture of sub-acute care services. This group include young chronic sick, those requiring physical rehabilitation, medical rehabilitation patients and elderly patients. The implementation of the plan, which provides an additional 235 alternative care places to cater for patients across the spectrum, has already been agreed. These 235 places can be broken down as follows: 70 sub-acute-convalescent places, 25 young chronic sick places and 140 long stay contract nursing home places. Some 95 of these beds are to be located on the campuses of acute hospitals with a further 140 sourced from private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Rehabilitation services also have an important role in areas for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. These services are being developed in line with the recommendations of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, which published its report, Towards an Independent Future, in December 1996. Priorities for development are respite care, day care, long-term residential care, home support services, including personal assistance, and therapy services. This year, £7 million, equalling a £14 million full-year cost in 2001, has been provided for the development of these services.</P>
    <P>I regard the continued development of rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services. I remain committed to the further development of rehabilitation services and my Department is currently considering the development of a national strategy for the development of rehabilitation services which would take into account the recommendations of the report, Towards an Independent Future and the report of the national advisory committee on medical rehabilitation.</P>

      <Quest>the number on the waiting list for various procedures in the Midland Health Board area, in particular those originating in Counties Longford and Westmeath waiting to be called for treatments, especially in the orthopaedic, ENT and heart and lung specialities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Waiting list data is collected on a quarterly basis by my Department, by hospital and by specialty. The data requested by the Deputy relating to the Midland Health Board is in the following table. It relates to September 1999, the latest date for which data is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated a further £23.5 million to agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2000. This <Col N="308" /> represents an increase of 17.5% over the £20 million allocated in 1999, and is almost three times the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997. In developing their service plans for 2000, agencies may include appropriate investment in aspects of out-patient services where they consider that the funding would help to address some of the underlying causes of unduly lengthy waiting lists. The agencies are being asked to consider all appropriate options for maximising the use of waiting list funding, with an emphasis on innovative methods for reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced at peak times at the accident and emergency department of St. James's Hospital where patients can be left waiting for over 20 hours before being admitted to a ward; if his attention has further been drawn to the shortage of bed spaces at these times; and if he will engage in discussions with the hospital authorities for the purposes of reviewing the hospitals capacity to deal with its catchment areas in view of these difficulties.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in recent times hospitals providing accident and emergency services, including St. James's Hospital, have experienced increased activity. However, it is important to note that while patients may experience delays in accident <Col N="313" /> and emergency departments, appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times.</P>
      <P>A contributing factor to the delays for patients who are awaiting admission from accident and emergency departments to acute hospitals is the number of patients who are inappropriately occupying acute hospital beds. The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative indicated that a significant proportion of such beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>As part of a package of measures to address these problems the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Dublin acute hospitals which provide accident and emergency services, were asked to examine this particular aspect of the service and to formulate a response. The board submitted a comprehensive action plan which takes into account the complex group of patients who need a mixture of sub-acute care services. This group include young chronic sick, physical rehabilitation cases, medical rehabilitation patients and elderly patients. The implementation of the plan, which provides an additional 235 alternative care places to cater for patients across the spectrum, has already been agreed and 205 of the places are already <i>in situ</i>. The remaining 30 will be in place by early February 2000. These 235 places can be broken down as follows: 70 sub-acute or convalescent places, 20 of which are located on the campus of St. James's Hospital, 25 young chronic sick places and 140 long stay contract nursing home places.</P>
      <P>In addition management at St. James's Hospital has proposed a range of measures aimed at alleviating pressure and improving the delivery of service in its accident and emergency department and these measures will be discussed in the context of the hospital's service plan for 2000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards should be doubled for persons aged 70 years or over. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for persons aged 70-79 and persons aged 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001. In the circumstances, I do not propose to make any adjustments to the £42 threshold.</P>

      <P>Both questions refer to facilities in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane. St. Ita's Hospital provides in-patient care and treatment for 300 persons with intellectual disability and 230 persons suffering from mental illness, acute and long term.</P>
      <P>I have acknowledged previously that much of the residential accommodation in the main hospital block at St. Ita's is no longer suitable to provide a modern therapeutic service for persons with long-term mental illness. In view of this, I have provided funding for the following upgrade of facilities: (a) two new kitchen dining areas in the services based at Reilly's Hill, capital cost £130,000; (b) replacement of heating system and upgrading which is nearing completion, capital cost £118,000; (c) major upgrading and extension of the acute and assessment units, which is also nearing completion, £750,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> In addition, I have recently given approval to the provision of a 60-bed acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital at a cost of over £5 million. When completed, this will enable the acute facilities at St. Ita's to be transferred to Beaumont which will, in turn, allow the existing extensively upgraded accommodation to be used for alternative care and accommodation.</P>
    <P>A major development plan for the intellectual disability services in St. Ita's is currently being implemented. The plan, which will cost £13 million, is being jointly funded by my Department and the Eastern Health Board and provides for the transfer of clients to a number of new residential complexes off the St. Ita's campus and for the development of new residential and day facilities on campus, together with the refurbishment of some existing facilities. A new residential and day services complex is currently being completed at Oldtown, County Dublin, and additional revenue funding amounting to £600,000 has been allocated in 2000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable this facility to be opened. The design brief has been completed in relation to the proposed new facilities to be provided on St. Ita's campus and it is hoped to have final design, planning and tendering processes completed and contractors on site towards the end of 2000 or in January 2001.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has overall responsibility for advising on and enforcing health and safety legislation and regulations. Health agencies, as with all other employers, have the responsibility for ensuring workplace health and safety.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has provided the following information relating to the number of reported accidents in the hospital sector in each of the years from 1997 to 1999. The numbers of occupational accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority, from the NACE classified economic sector hospital activities in each of the years are: 1997, 291; 1998, 257; 1999, 281.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide a separate breakdown of these reported accidents between the different areas of the health services sector.</P>
      <P>Employers are required to report to the Health and Safety Authority workplace accidents to employees that result in more than three days absence from work. The above data would, therefore, not include occupational accidents resulting in less than three days absence from work. In addition, it is estimated that the authority is notified only of about 30% of reportable accidents across all economic sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Health agencies are aware of the importance of their responsibilities under health and safety legislation. My Department has met with the Health and Safety Authority and the authority is in the process of forging a strategic alliance with the country's health boards to promote their common objectives in the area of workplace health and safety. The employment of health and safety officers in hospitals is not a statutory requirement. There is no data available on the number of hospitals where such appointments have been made. The question of appointing health and safety officers is essentially one for each individual hospital or agency.</P>

      <P>The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction &ndash; EMCDDA &ndash; publishes an annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union. A major task of the centre is to provide information that is objective, reliable and comparable. The Health Research Board is the focal point for Ireland and it provides an annual report on Irish data to the EMCDDA for inclusion in the European report.</P>
      <P>The 1999 EMCDDA report presented a figure on page 39 showing trends in the rate of change of drug related deaths in the period 1991/7, taking the 1991 figure as the baseline. The number of drug related deaths in Ireland in 1997 was 52, compared to seven in 1991. As the 1991 figure was so small, the 1997 figure indicates a significant upward trend. However, in countries where the baseline numbers are higher the upward trend over the period is not as marked. The point is made on the report that the markedly increasing trend in recent years in Ireland may be partly related to under-reporting in previous years. Figures for each year are outlined as follows:</P>

    <P>The drug misuse division of the Health Research Board is working with the agencies involved in recording drug related deaths to improve the reporting system. It held a workshop last August, involving the Dublin City Coroner, the Central Statistics Office, the Garda Síochána and health service personnel to examine how the reliability <Col N="318" /> of reports of drug related deaths could be further improved. In the past death certificates often gave the main cause of death as a medical condition other than drug use, although drug use may have been implicated in the death.</P>
    <P>The upward trend in the rate of change of drug related deaths is due to a number of factors, including more awareness and better recording practices as well as some real increase in the number of deaths. This information signals the need to continue education and prevention efforts and to provide appropriate treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare to people who need such services. It acknowledges that because drug use is often linked to social inclusion a broader and more thorough analysis of the problem is required to develop effective strategies to respond effectively to the problem and to prevent a continued upward trend.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, health boards and a range of statutory and voluntary agencies will continue to work in a co-ordinated fashion to tackle the problem and to halt the upward trend in drug misuse and related ill-health and deaths.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the concern expressed by the Irish Medical Organisation on behalf of junior doctors regarding their current working hours. I share that concern and I hope it will be possible to progressively reduce them to a more acceptable level.</P>
      <P>The standard working week of non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; is 39 hours. However as part of an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, NCHDs may be rostered for duty up to a maximum average of 65 hours per week. I should point out that NCHDs working hours include the standard working day, time spent on call and time spent working while on call. I do not dispute the fact that much of this time is actually spent working. NCHDs are the backbone of the hospital medical staffing structure and make a tremendous contribution to the provision of hospital care.</P>

      <Col N="320" /> The working hours of junior hospital doctors are currently the subject of discussion at European level in the context of proposals by the European Commission to bring junior doctors, and other groups excluded from the 1993 Working Time Directive within the scope of that directive.</P>
    <P>As part of our preparations for the implementation of a 48-hour working week for junior doctors it has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to undertake a study of hospital doctors' working hours. A firm of management consultants has just been appointed to conduct this study at eight hospitals. It is hoped to have a report from the consultants by the end of May. Hopefully this study will provide us with a sound factual basis for embarking on a progressive reduction of hospital doctors' working hours.</P>

      <P>The professional body governing pathology &ndash; Faculty of Pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland &ndash; are finalising a set of guidelines on this matter which will issue to all pathologists. The faculty has been reviewing current consent arrangements for post mortem examination and, in particular, the retention of tissue for further diagnoses, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and the nature and extent of the consent to be given will, therefore, form the basis for its ongoing consideration of the matter.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the recommendations of the faculty, which promotes and maintains the highest standards of post mortem examinations practice, will guide all pathologists and their staff on this sensitive issue thereby ensuring that the post mortem examination continues to enjoy public support and be conducted in a manner in which the public has confidence.</P>
      <P>Pending the issue by the faculty of pathology of these guidelines, my Department has instructed the chief executive officers of hospitals and health boards to ensure that a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post mortem and the retention of tissue/organs, operates in their agencies.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board has advised me that the board's standing committee for older peoples services advises on priority locations for the development of new and enhanced services for older people. The overall priority at this time is the provision of a new 30-bedded rehabilitation unit on the site of Merlin Park Hospital. The board has, in recent times, established a new assessment ward for older people in University Hospital, Galway, and a second geriatrician is due to take up duty on 1 May next. In addition, in the west Galway area, the board commissioned an additional 20 long stay beds at Áras Mhic Dara in Carraroe within the past two years and work is about to commence on a new housing cum nursing unit project at Kilronan on the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>The board also stated that the next priority has been given to developments in Loughrea and Tuam and the board anticipates that the development of St Francis' will be prioritised on completion of these projects when the next review takes place.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made into this matter and have been informed that it is the policy of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, to deal promptly with all urgent cases who attend the hospital and require x-ray examinations. For this reason there is no waiting list or waiting times for x-ray exam<Col N="323" /> inations for accident and emergency patients or for in-patients at the hospital. I am also informed that the hospital endeavours to deal as quickly as possible with patients referred from its out-patients department, having regard to the fact that such patients have already attended the out-patient department and require an x-ray examination for investigative purposes.</P>
      <P>The hospital categorises patients referred by general practitioners for x-ray examinations according to their medical priority and high priority cases are dealt with immediately. Should a general practitioner consider that a particular patient requires an x-ray examination as a matter of urgency she or he may also contact the radiology department directly to discuss and/or emphasis the urgency of the case. The hospital is conscious of the fact that waiting times for non-urgent routine examinations referred by general practitioners have expanded to a number of weeks in certain cases and is endeavouring to address problem. This matter will be the subject of discussion with hospital management in the context of its service plan developments for 2000 which will be held shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of breastfeeding is supported by the health promotion unit of my Department in a number of ways in line with the national breastfeeding policy. In prioritising the recommendations of that policy and how they might be implemented it was recognised that the support of health professionals would be critical. They are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Consequently, the National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. This training pack has been widely disseminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key recommendation of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the &ldquo;Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative&rdquo;. This global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. The initiative has recently been established in <Col N="324" /> Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
    <P>My Department through the health promotion unit also continues to be involved in ensuring that the other recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy are implemented. Other initiatives undertaken to achieve this include the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding and supporting voluntary organisations such as La Leche League, Cuidiu (Irish Childbirth Trust) and the Association of Lactation Consultant to further promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit is committed to continue its support for the implementation of the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. I am confident that the continuing implementation of the recommendations and particularly the growing participation in the baby friendly hospital initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>There is currently no legislation governing the provision of counselling services and those employed as counsellors are subject only to regulatory regimes and guidelines operated by their respective professional bodies.</P>
      <P>Services such as those in the attached advertisement, namely spiritual healing, fall under the area of alternative or complementary medicine. The current position in relation to alternative or complementary medicine in Ireland is that it is not regulated by statute as practitioners of alternative or complementary medicine are not employed within the public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the control of standards and codes of practice in this area, the Department's policy has been to encourage the various therapeutic groups to establish their own regulatory <Col N="325" /> structure and to develop mechanisms to inform the general public about the availability of services from reputable therapists. Many of the therapeutic groups have adopted this system of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that it is desirable to afford some protection to the public who wish to use such therapies. The legal position of practitioners of complementary or alternative medicines is that their dealings with their clients are regulated by civil law.</P>
    <P>There are proposals before the European Commission at present to consider carrying out a research study into the area of complementary or alternative medicines. Any such study will undoubtedly investigate the subjects of safety, effectiveness and area of application. It is anticipated that on completion, this research project will result in state registration of some type in each member state.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 464 together.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of services at Naas General Hospital, has previously explored the possibility of availing of the facilities at the Curragh Military Hospital with the Department of Defence. The Department of Defence advised that the siting of a civilian facility in the centre of a military installation would be inappropriate for security reasons.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the capital development project at Naas General Hospital has commenced. This development will replace antiquated buildings offering poor facilities with a modern facility, utilising a combination of new build integrated with substantially upgraded existing structures.</P>
      <P>The increase in the population of the Naas catchment area in recent years has added considerably to the workload of the hospital. The hospital's management and staff have nevertheless endeavoured to meet the increase in demand for service as a consequence and have succeeded in doing so despite the limitations imposed on their efforts by virtue of inadequate hospital infrastructure which imposed severe restrictions both in terms of service delivery and service developments.</P>
      <P>I am confident that when completed the capital development at the hospital, which reflects the emphasis on the provision of a modern acute hospital to meet the needs of the catchment areas, will alleviate any difficulties being experience in the provision of services.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to drug misuse is that a wide range of drug treatment options should be provided, including methadone maintenance, detoxification and other programmes aimed at those addicted to drugs, especially those addicted to heroin. The overall aim is to restore people to a drug free lifestyle, although it is recognised that this may not be a realistic goal for some long term drug users, especially in the short term.</P>
      <P>The provision of treatment services for drug misusers is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. Where a substitution drug is recommended for the treatment of opiate dependence methadone is the current preferred option. However, the medical consultants involved in the treatment of such patients continually monitor and review new treatment therapies. I understand that ibogaine is being monitored by the consultants, but at present there is insufficient data to justify the use of this drug outside of the research setting. If, however, following research this drug is proven to be effective in the treatment of drug misuse it will be considered for use in drug treatment programmes, should this be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under section 5 of the 1996 accountability legislation, the Minister is required to notify a determination of non-capital expenditure to the health boards 21 days after the publication by the Government of the Estimates for supply services for that financial year. The health boards under section 6(1) of the legislation are then required to prepare a service plan outlining the services which will be provided in the coming year, within 42 days of receipt of the letter of determination. The service plans must be within the determination notified by the Minister. It is the responsibility of the board members of each health board to approve the service plan before submitting it to the Minister. On receipt of the service plan the Minister may, under section 6(6) of this legislation, within 21 days ask the board members to modify the service plan.</P>
      <P>The Department has now received all of the health board service plans and is in the process of meeting with health board management teams in relation to their service plans.</P>
      <P>Moneys allocated to the health boards for 2000 are set out in the table below. These allocations represent a significant increase on the 1999 determination. This is an 18% increase over the 1999 revised base determination.</P>

      <P>Under eligibility arrangements which were introduced in 1991, beds in public hospitals are formally designated as public, private or non-designated. These designations are subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The first designations came into operation in March 1992. The following table sets out the number of designated public hospital beds at 31 December for the years 1992-9.</P>
      <P>Considerable care should be taken in interpreting these figures as there has been a very significant shift towards day cases in the overall provision of hospital care. There has been an estimated increase of almost 100% in day cases in the period 1992-9; in regard to the overall increase of hospital throughput at in-patient and day case level, there has been an estimated rise of 26% during the period 1992-9. Also changes have occurred in procedures in out-patient departments whereby cases can now be treated at out-patient level which previously would have required admission to hospitals.</P>

    <P>*The consolidation of beds at Tallaght Hospital from the constituent Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals has resulted in a temporary reduction in the overall number of designated beds in use. The hospital is in the process of building a 70 to 75 private-semi-private bed facility which is being developed and financed by the hospital itself. When completed this will return the total bed complement to the level it was prior to the move and the revised total nationally will be approximately 12,361. In addition, there are ongoing projects in the planning and construction phases which will provide significant extra bed capacity for the relevant hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not routinely collect information in relation to numbers of cancelled elective procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of elective activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning process which is <Col N="332" /> required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The unpredictable nature of activity generated by emergency admissions means that cancellations of elective procedures are inevitable from time to time as the system tries to cope with unexpected peaks. As part of the service planning process, it is a matter for agencies to attempt to take account of these peaks and troughs when planning their elective activity levels over a 12 month period. It is important that cancellations of elective procedures are viewed, therefore, in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the 12 month period. In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals for the first nine months of 1999 was 631,998 which was over 4% of an increase on the figure of 606,619 for the same period in 1998.</P>

      <P>No savings will accrue to my Department following the increase in private and semi-private accommodation charges which came into effect on 1 January last. However, it is estimated that the increase in charges will provide additional income to public hospitals of about £7 million in 2000 and will ensure a higher approved budget than would be the case if the charges had not been increased. This additional income will therefore contribute, along with a record funding provision made available by my Department, to the substantial improvements in the health services being put in place this year.</P>

This mirrors the recognition and training arrangements in medical specialities.</P>
      <P>The health board regional orthodontic units have requested a training programme for staff which falls outside the existing full-time and part-time training programme. The dental schools in Dublin and Cork together with the Royal Colleges of Surgeons have agreed to provide whatever training is required by the health boards provided such programmes are designed in accordance with the guidelines of the Dental Council and the specialist advisory committee of the Joint Committee for Higher Training in Dentistry. In this regard two trainees of the Western Health Board are undergoing a training programme in the Dublin Dental Hospital which was approved by the specialist advisory committee when it visited the dental schools and health board regional orthodontic units at the invitation of the chief dental officer of my Department.</P>
      <P>A programme proposed for trainees in the Southern Health Board in collaboration with the two dental schools was found not to meet the required standard by the specialist advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was agreed that a programme for trainees from the Southern Health Board in collaboration with the Cork Dental School would be <Col N="336" /> re-examined as soon as the recommendations of the visiting committee were implemented.</P>

The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the sur<Col N="337" /> veillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
      <P>In recent years surveillance systems in relation to meningitis have been significantly improved. Health boards are required to notify details of cases to my Department within 24 hours of them occurring and these arrangements are operating effectively. My Department has also funded the establishment of the meningococcal reference laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, and the diagnostic service provided by this laboratory has had a significant impact on case ascertainment and confirmation of the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease. The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in recent years research has been undertaken in Ireland on a range of issues in relation to this disease, including whether particular sub-groups within the population may be at particular risk of contracting meningococcal infection, the question of genetic susceptibility to infection, the early management of the acute condition and on the follow-up of surviving children.</P>
      <P>All these developments enable the nature of meningococccal disease in Ireland to be better understood, although the reasons for the high incidence of this condition in this country are still not fully apparent.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): The national cancer strategy identifies research into cancer as one of the key areas for investment in order to combat this disease. Under the terms of the action plan for the implementation of the national cancer strategy total funding of £320,000 has been granted in respect of four years 1997-2000 inclusive to the Health Research Board for cancer research. When deciding on the projects to fund, the national cancer strategy indicated that the emphasis should be on infrastructural co-ordination and that projects to be funded would be multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary in nature. These criteria are applied when the health research board awards grants. In addition to the funding allocated under the national cancer strategy, my Department has provided funding to the amount of approximately £320,000 through the Health Research Board for cancer research in 1999. The allocations for 2000 have yet to be made.</P>
    <P>The recently agreed memorandum of understanding, which I signed in Belfast on 3 October 1999, with the national cancer institute, Washington and the Department of Health and Social Services of Northern Ireland, provides for co-operation between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States on a number of cancer related issues, including research. In addition a North-South official working group on cancer research, with representation from my Department, has now been established under the structures for co-operation being put in place under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. The unit also supports the production of information materials relating to cancer.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy of my continued commitment to the further implementation of the national cancer strategy and measures aimed at reducing the incidence of this disease.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services to children with an intellectual and/or physical disability is a matter in the first instance for the health boards. The regional intellectual disability consultative and development committees in each health board region identify priorities for service development and co-ordinate the provision of services, including additional services as resources become available. These committees are representative of the health board, voluntary service providers and families of persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional revenue funding which has been allocated in 2000 is designed to support the <Col N="340" /> development of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. Due to the timeframe involved in bringing all the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding will provide a broad range of support services including residential, respite and day care facilities, in addition to other support services for families of persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are two nursing degree courses on offer at the National University of Ireland, Galway: a one academic year course and a part-time course that can be undertaken over 18 or 24 months. Following the Government meeting in Ballaghaderreen last week, the Taoiseach and I met a delegation of nursing students wishing to undertake the former course who are seeking to have their fees paid. In response to representations made to me by the students, I gave an undertaking that I would ask my Depart<Col N="341" /> ment to investigate whether anything could be done for them.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the students concerned have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme and are entitled to register as nurses with An Bord Altranais. While undertaking the diploma programme, their third-level fees were paid by the relevant health agency and they also received an annual non-means tested maintenance grant and other supports. The difficulty with the one academic year degree course is that it is outside the scope of the funding arrangements agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of pre-registration nursing education.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Nursing has recommended that no third-level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the academic year 2002-03. Since a degree in nursing is not at present a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, it is regarded as an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a degree programme are in the same way as any other public service workers responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. It is, however, open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Most health agencies have a continuing nursing education budget and funding from this budget is used to help nurses wishing to undertake further education.</P>
      <P>My Department has given further consideration to the position of the Galway students wishing to undertake the one-academic year degree course. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ringfence any arrangements for these students. There are currently some 3,100 nursing students participating in the nursing diploma programmes at various third level institutions around the country, and it is expected that there will be an additional 1,500 students next autumn. It would be inequitable to meet the fees of the students who have enrolled for the degree course being provided by NUI Galway but not make similar provision for all the other nursing students.</P>
      <P>The concession being sought by the Galway students, if granted, would also give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of registered nurses undertaking degree and other courses on a part-time basis that they should also have their fees paid in full. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that there are currently in the region of 1,000 nurses undertaking such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further factor that must be taken into account is the importance of newly qualified nurses who have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme entering the workforce as soon as they are registered. If students were to delay their entry by a further year in order to undertake a degree course on a full-time basis, then this would exacerbate the <Col N="342" /> difficulties that some hospitals are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, and having regard to the wider financial and other implications involved, my Department is not in a position to meet the fees of those students wishing to undertake the degree course at NUI Galway.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that flexible arrangements are in place so as to afford some choices to these students. The degree course in question is structured in such a way as to allow the students to undertake part-time nursing work. My Department understands from the Western Health Board that some of the students who did the course last year worked an average of 20-24 hours per week and earned between £150 and £300 per week. It further understands from the health board that part-time work can be offered to this year's group on a similarly flexible basis so as not to interfere with their attendance at the university.</P>

      <P>The new county-city development boards &ndash; CDBs &ndash; are being set up on foot of the recommendations of a task force on the integration of local government and local development systems. The membership of the boards is drawn up from local government, mainly councillors, local development agencies, State agencies operating locally and the social partners. To ensure a reasonable balance between political and executive representation, the task force believed that representation from the State agencies, into which tourism falls, should be at executive level. The regional tourism organisations, which will represent the tourism section, in practice have specific officers assigned at county level.</P>
      <P>The task force also saw the CDBs building up their county-city strategies on economic, social and cultural development on the basis of particular themes, of which tourism would be one, and setting up appropriate sub-structures for this purpose.

      <P>I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grants scheme twice in 12 months, in December 1998 and again last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as November 1998 the effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was £8,000 or two-thirds of the approved cost of the works in the case of private houses. Since then I have increased the maximum to £14,000 or 90% <Col N="344" /> of the approved cost in the case of works commenced on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
    <P>In cases where an applicant faces a difficulty in meeting their portion of the total cost of the works involved, local authorities may assist through the provision of a house improvement loan. If the applicant cannot afford to avail of the loan scheme due to the cost of servicing a loan, it would be open to the authority to provide the full cost of the works under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, subject to the applicant being approved for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In the case of local authority rented houses the maximum grant payable covers the full cost of the approved works. However, I have no proposals to introduce a 100% disabled person's grant in the case of private houses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500, 501, 505, 506, 514, 528, 536 and 553 together.</P>
      <P>The qualifications for the post of library assistant in the local authority library service were amended in 1996 following a recommendation from a working group on which local authority managers, the then local government staff negotiations board and my Department were represented. The qualifications were also agreed with An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, the Library Association of Ireland and staff interests. The new qualifications were intended to broaden the candidature, update the educational requirements and test a current knowledge of spoken Irish as distinct from a leaving certificate result.</P>
      <P>Given the role of the library service as a cultural and educational resource, and the fact that both Irish speaking and English speaking members of the public are entitled to an adequate library service, it was concluded that applicants for the post of library assistant should have a sufficient knowledge of both Irish and English to enable them to perform their duties in both languages. The requirement in the qualifications is not an onerous one and simply demands a reasonable level of everyday Irish such as to enable the applicant to communicate in the language. The general means of testing the candidates in this regard is a brief straightforward oral interview, and neither total fluency nor a knowledge of unusual terminology should be necessary. However, in view of the representations I have received on this matter, I will have this requirement reviewed in consultation with all interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifications declared for local authority posts apply equally to all candidates. I cannot provide special assistance to any given persons who do not meet these qualifications, nor, in the <Col N="346" /> event of the qualifications being amended, will it be possible to distinguish between applicants based on their origin or where they received their education.</P>

The bulk of new licences will accordingly be offered to existing taxi licence holders.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the increase in Dublin taxi numbers will benefit both the public in terms of improved and reliable quality of service and taxi service providers in terms of increased use of taxis.</P>

      <P>In February 1998, I established the electoral area boundary committee to review and make recommendations on the divisions into local electoral areas of all counties and county boroughs outside of the Dublin area. In accordance with statutory requirements, the committee requested each local authority coming within its terms of reference to submit proposals for the revision of their local electoral areas. The committee also wrote to each Member of the Oireachtas and to each registered political party inviting written submissions. In addition, submissions from the public were sought by way of notices in the national and provincial newspapers.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Laois, the committee recommended that an area in the south western end of the then Tinnahinch local electoral area should be included in the Borris-in-Ossory local electoral area. Mountmellick was also suggested as a more appropriate name for the revised area, formerly Tinnahinch, in order to make the name more readily recognisable and to more accurately reflect its geographic focus. The committee's recommendations for all counties and county boroughs were accepted in full and have been implemented.</P>

      <Col N="353" /> The numbers of housing starts allocated to Westport Urban District Council in each of the years from 1990 to 1999 are set out in the following table. The number of housing starts allocated to Westport Urban District Council for the period 2000 to 2003 was determined at 30 units after taking into account the housing needs of the urban council as well as their record of providing houses. The Department's records indicate that a total of 18 houses were completed by the urban council in the period 1996 to 1999. However, the Department will keep the position under review on progress being made by the urban council in implementing the programme of starts it has now been allocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital provision for library development was increased from £2.76 million in 1998 to £7.2 million for 1999 and £6.6 million for this year.</P>
      <P>In the light of the increased funding available, library authorities were asked by my Department in January 1999 to submit a prioritised list of library projects in order that an expenditure programme could be formulated by the Department. The priority building proposal identified by Kerry library authority was the Tralee library and headquarters, proposals for which are currently under examination in my Department. The proposed new library in Castleisland is included in the list supplied by the library authority but with a lower level of priority.</P>
      <P>Last year I approved a multiannual expenditure programme for library development which, together with projects already under construction, involves a commitment of over £25 million in grant-aid in the period 1999-2002. The programme includes the funding of a mobile library and a delivery van for Kerry library authority.</P>
      <P>The intention, arising from the Branching Out  review of public library policy, is to complete a major redevelopment of our public library infrastructure over an eight year period from 1999 to 2006.  I expect that the Castleisland library will be provided under this programme but it is not possible at this stage to be more specific on the timescale.</P>

      <P>The interim all-in-budget cost for the remedial works scheme project at Donomore-Killinarden is some £7.2 million, and an initial allocation of £300,000 was made to South Dublin County Council in respect of this project in 1999.</P>
      <P>Proposals have also been received by my Department from the council in respect of the following estates: Moorefield, Clondalkin and Avonbeg Flats &ndash; pilot project &ndash; Tallaght.</P>
      <P>These projects were designated for funding under the remedial works scheme in 1998. No expenditure was incurred by the council in respect of the projects in 1997 or 1998. Funding of £700,000 in respect of Avonbeg Flats was made available to the council in 1999.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations under the remedial works scheme for the current year are under consideration at present and will be notified to local authorities as soon as possible. Funding for future years will be subject to progress on the individual projects, the amount available nationally under the scheme and the competing demands of other local authorities.</P>

      <P>The number of one bedroomed units provided by local authorities in each of the past five years was of the order of 200 to 250 per year or about 8% of the programme. Most of these units were provided for elderly persons.</P>
      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 revealed that single person households, including elderly persons, account for 29% of the net need for local authority housing. Subsequently, local authorities were advised, in new social housing design guidelines issued last September, of the need to provide a mix of dwellings based primarily on the results of their most recent assessment of housing needs and the characteristics of households to be accommodated in their housing schemes. They were also advised that regard should be had to current best estimates regarding the size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future and of the need to ensure that a reasonable mix of dwelling types and sizes is maintained, both in the immediate locality and in the housing stock as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 recognises the possible influence of drugs on driving behaviour as an issue of increasing concern. It is illegal in Ireland to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
      <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, I have this year provided additional funding of some £100,000 to the medical bureau of road safety to commence a two year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens. This project when completed will, along with wider international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, in enforcement practice and procedure, and/or in legislation.</P>

      <P>To date, waste management plans under the 1996 Act have been made by Dublin and Waterford corporations, and Cork, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare, South Dublin, Tipperary &ndash; South Riding, &ndash; Waterford and Wexford county councils.</P>

      <P>Section 23 of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which has been passed by the Seanad and is now before the House, will require regional planning guidelines to take account of Government policies and objectives, including any national plans, policies or strategies specified by the Minister to be relevant to the determination of strategic planning policies. In turn, local development plans will have to have regard to any regional planning guidelines in force. I am considering introducing some amendments to the Bill with the aim of further strengthening the linkages between the proposed national spatial strategy and local development plans. On a wider level, I envisage that, in the context of drawing up an implementation programme as part of the strategy, consideration will be given to the need for, or desirability of, further legislation.</P>

The proposed works included the refurbishment of the houses, rewiring, the replacement of windows and doors, the provision of central heating, together with environmental works to the estate. The cost was estimated to be in the order of £500,000 at 1997 prices. Following discussions between the council and technical officers of my Department, the council undertook to review its proposals for the estate. I understand that the council has appointed consultants and agreed a brief to develop revised proposals. A decision on funding will be made as soon as possible following on receipt of the council's revised proposals in my Department.</P>

Grants totalling £339.3 million have been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in respect of the year 2000 as a contribution towards their general purpose needs including the community and enterprise directorates. In arriving at this figure, which represents an increase of 4.8% over the corresponding 1999 allocations, the Minister had regard to the additional costs arising in respect of these directorates. It remains a matter for individual local authorities to decide how its local government fund allocation is spent.</P>

      <P>I understand that the flooding in Limerick was mainly due to a combination of heavy rainfall and unprecedented high tides. Such relief measures as were possible, including pumping operations, were carried by Limerick Corporation with the assistance of the Army and Civil Defence. Temporary bunds constructed in connection with the Limerick main drainage scheme, which it was considered might be contributing to slowing the abatement of flood waters in the area adjacent to Abbey River, were also breached by the contractor at the corporation's request.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in the meantime, the corporation has put a number of short-term measures in place in an effort to mitigate the effects of any recurrence of the flooding and also intends to initiate a detailed study, involving outside consultants, with a view to identifying a long-term solution to the problem. If any proposals emanate from this study that would be eligible for funding under my Department's water services or roads programmes they will be carefully considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to compensation for householders for loss or damage caused by flooding, I regret that no funds are available to me for that purpose. In many cases residents would be covered by household insurance.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities. Responsibility for inviting, processing and approving applications under the scheme rests with the individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>The scheme was launched in March 1999 and some 40 houses were completed under the scheme with over 100 more under construction by the end of the year, which is less than I had hoped. The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses, of necessity, requires some time to arrange and I expect a significant increase in output this year.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that Kildare County Council and the urban authorities in County Kildare are receiving sufficient funding to enable them to carry out their responsibilities in relation to the non-national road network.</P>
      <P>Kildare County Council has received significant and increasing non-national road grants from my Department in the last few years, for example, £4.8 million in 1996, £5.062 million in 1997, £6.94 million in 1998 and £7.698 million in 1999. The 1999 grant payment represented a 60% increase on the 1996 grant payment.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are reminded when notified of their grant allocations each year that it is a matter for each authority to finance weather necessitated works from its own resources, supplemented, as required, from discretionary grant allocations. Local authorities are also advised, in line with established practice, that a contingency provision should be reserved from the overall resources available for non-national roads to deal with damage attributed to severe weather conditions, including flooding.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1996 to 1999 Kildare County Council's discretionary maintenance grant payments have increased by some 38% from £0.761 million in 1996 to £1.050 million in 1999.</P>

      <P>Latest figures available to my Department show that 41,486 houses were completed in the first 11 months of 1999, representing an increase of 10.4% on the same period in 1998. While final figures for 1999 are not yet available to my Department, I expect that a total of some 46,000 houses, both public and private, were completed during 1999, representing a new record level of housing output.</P>
      <P>Demand for housing generally is influenced by many factors including strong economic growth, low interest rates, increasing employment, rising levels of real personal disposable income and demographic changes. Forecasts of continued strong economic growth along with recent demographic predictions coupled with high immigration, particularly in the key household formation age categories, and the fall in average household size all point towards continued high demand for housing. For this reason the national development plan provides the framework for an integrated investment strategy to facilitate the provision of 500,000 houses over the next ten years. The provision of £6 billion investment for social and affordable housing will ensure that the social housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>

      <P>The report Water Quality in Ireland 1995-1997, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in May 1999, contains the most recent and comprehensive data available in relation to the quality of Irish waters generally, including groundwaters. It includes an assessment of groundwater quality by reference to a selection of parameters including ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, chloride, phosphate, iron, manganese, total and faecal coliforms, pesticides and other toxic contaminants. While the report indicates that groundwaters are generally of high quality it also identifies localised problems due, for example, to bacteriological contamination and elevated nitrate values. Reference should be made to the report, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, as to the location of sampling stations and the monitoring levels recorded for individual parameters in different areas.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes. The functions of the agency in this regard include supervision of the performance of statutory environmental functions by local authorities. Data on groundwater resources, including the mapping and characterisation of aquifers and quality aspects, are also maintained by the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive statutory provisions for the protection of groundwaters are contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 <Col N="377" /> and 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and related legislation and additional measures are put in place as required. I made the Protection of Groundwater Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 41 of 1999) in February 1999 in relation to discharges to aquifers by local authorities. Guidelines, prepared jointly by the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and my Department, on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes were issued to local authorities in May 1999. I refer to my reply to Question No. 77 on today's Order Paper which outlines the comprehensive range of measures under way under the rural water programme to address bacteriological contamination in waters, including groundwaters, which are used as sources of drinking water. Proposals are also being developed in my Department for additional measures to be taken for the protection of groundwaters against pollution by nitrates, including the designation of nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with EU Directive 91/676.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for monitoring water quality rests primarily with local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>Flooding creates exceptional conditions which are not representative of water quality conditions generally and which are usually short-term. While I am not aware of any specific surveys to evaluate the impact of flooding on water quality, the effects of flooding in this regard have been documented on the basis of routine water quality surveys which coincided with flood conditions. In general, rivers in flood contain higher concentrations than normal of organic matter, nutrients, bacteria and other contaminants and may have high concentrations of suspended solids. Flooding in rivers is often accompanied by highly turbulent conditions leading to high aeration rates and, in general, the level of deoxygenation is moderate despite possibly high concentrations of biodegradable organic matter. In sluggish rivers or large lakes, some of the organic matter and nutrients may be incorporated in sediments and subsequently released to the overlying waters. The upper end of boreholes can be protected by sealing, and protection for groundwaters generally is provided by the passage of flood waters through soil layers which remove most contaminants. In some areas of karstic limestone, fissures may facilitate rapid movement downwards of contaminated water which may lead to pollution of groundwaters.</P>
      <P>The conditions which may be generated by flooding are taken into account in the design, location and operation by local authorities of treatment plants for the production of drinking water. The operation of such plants is adjusted as necessary to respond to higher pollution loads which may be present in floodwaters and to counteract, for example, increased colour, bacterial matter and suspended solids. Where necessary, smaller treatment plants may be shut down on a precautionary basis for the duration of high water periods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 597 and 600 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, to carers in receipt of carer's allowance, to carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance and also to people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of the free travel scheme is to assist and encourage older people to remain active in the community. There would be significant costs involved in extending the free travel scheme generally to people aged 60 to 66.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are generally available to older people and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and are living alone or with certain excepted people.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are also available to low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means-test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is currently £89.00 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £94.00 for a recipient aged 80 years or over plus £30.00; plus any increases for adult or child dependants or for living alone.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 made provision for the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, the free electricity allowance and free television licence will be extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance, thereby qualifying the group of carers for all free schemes. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements. The issue of extending the free schemes to retired public servants is being examined in the review.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the Policy Institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series in March 2000.</P>

      <P>Under the current arrangements, long-term unemployed people who avail of the back-to-work allowance scheme can retain their secondary benefits, including the rent supplement paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, provided that the gross household weekly income does not exceed £250. The maximum rent supplement payable is £250 per month.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 provides for two important improvements in these arrangements. First, the back-to-work allowance payments and family income supplement payments will be disregarded for the purposes of the weekly £250 gross household income limit. Second, the maximum rent supplement payment of £250 per month is being abolished in favour of a tapered withdrawal of the supplement over a four-year period, with 75% of the claimants previous entitlement being paid in the first year of participation in the scheme, and 50%, 25% and 25% being paid in the subsequent three years.</P>
      <P>These measures will come into effect from early April. They will ensure that more scheme participants will be enabled to qualify for retention of secondary benefits and that in the case of families with children, substantially increased supports will be provided in the critical early years of transition from unemployment to employment.</P>

      <P>Individualisation of the social welfare system was considered in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting, and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes.</P>
      <P>The group noted that individualisation already exists to a certain extent, first, in the social insurance system to the extent that those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individ<Col N="382" /> uals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been achieved in this area over the past 12 years with coverage being extended to the self employed in 1988, part-time workers in 1991 and new civil-public servants in 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    <P>The working group also proposed, on foot of research on equivalent scales undertaken by the ESRI for the group, that the qualified adult allowance, QAA, should be increased to 70% of the personal rate. The Government intends to reach this recommended level for the QAA over a period of three budgets and the process was started in the recent budget with increases of between 8% to 17% being provided.</P>
    <P>In principle, the QAA rate is set at less than 100% of the personal rate on the basis that there are economies of scale where two people live together in the same household, and that account should be taken of these economies where the second person does not have a direct entitlement to the payment in his-her own right.</P>
    <P>The group also considered that a general system of administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of the QAA direct to the person concerned should be introduced. The question of making such separate payments in all cases involves some complex social issues which need to be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of the qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment. In addition there would be some administrative and cost implications.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to individualisation overall in the social welfare code will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to parental leave is provided for under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. This Act implements the provisions of EU Directive 96/34/EC, which in turn gives effect to a framework agreement on parental leave that was concluded at EU level by employer and trade union interests. The Parental Leave Act provides for 14 weeks unpaid leave for parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996. This leave, which is non-transferable between parents, can be taken as a continuous block or, by agreement between the employer and employee, as a number of broken periods, including reduced working hours. <Col N="383" /> Employees retain their employment rights during the period of leave.</P>
      <P>There is no requirement under the directive that parental leave be provided for on a paid basis. The social partners who negotiated the framework agreement left this issue for decision by individual member states. Paid parental leave could be provided for in a number of ways. For instance, it could be provided through the continuation of payment of wages by employers, through the introduction a social welfare parental leave benefit scheme, or through a combination of both of these methods.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Family was of the view that in order to provide practical assistance to those parents who wish to take time out of the workforce to care for their young children, parental leave should be paid. Accordingly, the commission recommended the introduction of a social insurance payment on the lines of maternity benefit for workers availing of parental leave, which it estimated at that time would cost in the region of £40 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The cost of any possible parental leave benefit scheme would depend to a large extent on the level of take-up. International experience indicates that take-up levels are determined by a number of factors, including the levels of benefit available, flexibility of the leave arrangements, non-transferability of leave between parents and prevailing social attitudes.</P>
      <P>Based on the current numbers at work and the level of births, it is estimated that the cost of introducing a parental leave benefit scheme on the lines of the maternity benefit scheme would be in the region of £56 million annually. There would also be additional Exchequer costs arising in relation to payroll costs of the many public servants who do not pay full PRSI.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that parental leave is provided for under a framework agreement negotiated at EU level between employer and trade union interests; there would be significant costs involved in providing a parental leave benefit, not alone for the Exchequer but also for employers in terms of having to hire replacement staff during periods of parental leave; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has raised the question of a new paid parental leave scheme in the context of the current negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000; and significant difficulties would arise in trying to tie in payment of a parental leave benefit with the parental leave period where leave is taken in the form of reduced hours worked or in days off, it is considered that progress on the question of introducing paid parental leave can be best achieved in the context of the national partnership discussions which are currently taking place.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who was in receipt of disability allowance at the maximum rate of £114.70 per week reached pension age on 6 January 2000.</P>
      <P>He has been awarded a pension of £92.70 per week with effect from 7 January 2000. This amount comprises a personal rate of £58.50 and an increase of £34.20 in respect of his wife. This decision is based on a means assessment of £25.96 per week, deriving from the capital value of a second property owned by him.</P>
      <P>Disability allowance had been in payment to him at the maximum rate because his previous entitlement under the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was preserved under the transitional arrangements which were made on the transfer of disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients to the new disability allowance scheme administered by my Department. For the purposes of his pension application, however, his means must be assessed under the rules applying to that scheme. If he is not satisfied with this decision he may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>His means will be reviewed again later this year in the context of the improved capital assessment rules announced at budget time and for which provision is being made in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>The person concerned commenced paying self-employment contributions for the first time in 1991-92 at which stage he was 58 years of age.

      <P>In addition to their core funding, funding is made available to community development programme and other projects who wish to sponsor the attendance of a local person at a suitable full-time or part-time degree or diploma course in community development. Essentially this allows the project to sponsor a local community activist with a good track record of involvement in community development to undertake a programme of work experience and pursue an academic qualification over a two to three year period. This fosters greater inclusion of local people in the project, their participation in wider fora that make decisions on issues that affect their communities and increases the chances of the individuals involved themselves getting paid employment in community development work and the pool of qualified prospective candidates for community development jobs that come on stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 610 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
      <P>As with other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of the income from employment and other sources. In line with budget 1999 changes which came into effect last August, the first £150 of joint weekly income for married carers is not taken into account in the means test. In the case of single carers, the first £75 of weekly income is disregarded.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that the means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. While the review did not recommend the abolition of the means test, it did propose the introduction of a continual care payment in certain circumstances in recognition of the caring provided.</P>
      <P>The rate of the carer's allowance will increase in May this year by £4 per week for recipients of the allowance who are under age 66 and by £7 per week for those who are over age 66. This is an increase of 5.2% and 8.6% respectively on the 1999 rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new carer's benefit scheme announced in the recent budget is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The carer's benefit scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. As the carer's benefit payment will be made to the person leav<Col N="387" /> ing employment and his-her employment rights will then be protected, it would not be possible to extend the scheme to the spouse in the home of the qualifying person.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will be introducing a special tax allowance to support those who are caring full time in the home.</P>
    <P>The position of carers is being kept under review, as is clear from the budget changes, and this will continue to be the position taking account of the other proposals in the review referred to above.</P>

      <P>The bereavement grant of £500 is intended to assist with funeral costs and is payable on the death of an insured person. The scheme, which was introduced in February 1999, replaced the death grant scheme of £100 and eased the qualifying conditions for entitlement. Almost 17,000 people benefited under the scheme in 1999.</P>
      <P>In the recent budget I announced the widowed parent's grant of £1,000 which is a new scheme designed to assist with the income support needs of widows and widowers with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. It is payable to those who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. It is estimated that about 1,500 widowed people will benefit from this grant each year.</P>
      <P>The Department has been monitoring the cost of funerals since the introduction of the bereavement grant last year and is also in contact with The Irish Association of Funeral Directors &ndash; IAFD.

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular financial diffi<Col N="388" /> culties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension scheme are more flexible than those applying to the old age and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify by using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a person may also use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my budget speech and following the review of the action programme for the millennium, this Government is committed to extending a pension rate of £100 per week to all social welfare pensions for older people. In this regard, from May 2000, the weekly rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension will increase to £89.10 per week for those aged over 66. The maximum rate for a person aged under 66 years will be £81.10.</P>
      <P>A widow's and widower's non contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>From May 2000 the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non contributory pension will be £85.50 per week for those over age 66 and £77.50 for those aged under 66.</P>
      <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers with children who do not qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension can qualify for the one-parent family payment, the rate of which will be £85.50 per week for those over 66 and £77.50 for those under 66 with effect from May 2000. It is available to both men and women who are parenting alone and is designed to, first, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, second, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence. To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 budget I introduced the bereavement grant which increased the payment on the death of an insured person from £100 to £500. This payment benefited almost 17,000 people last year. I announced a widowed parent's grant of £1,000 in the recent budget to provide additional support for those with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. The grant is expected to benefit about 1,500 widowed people each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The improvements set out above are of specific benefit to widowed people and the position with regard to any further changes will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing the award of unemployment benefit provide, among other things, that a person must have sustained a substantial loss of employment in any period of six consecutive days to be eligible for payment. The regulations also provide that for a loss of employment to have been sustained there must also have been a reduction in earnings.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these regulations, a claimant of unemployment benefit is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if he or she has lost at least one day of insurable employment from that which is deemed to be his or her normal level of employment, coupled with a loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>These measures were introduced following on the extension of PRSI to cover part-time workers in 1991 and were necessary to ensure that the conditions of the scheme remained consistent with its primary objective, which is to provide a replacement income to persons who have lost their full-time jobs. There are no plans to amend these measures.</P>
      <P>In the case cited by the Deputy, the conditions relating to substantial loss of employment would not be satisfied and, accordingly, there would be no entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that a person who fails to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition for unemployment benefit may, subject to <Col N="390" /> a means test, qualify for payment of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 and 620 together.</P>
      <P>Current legislation provides that unemployment benefit is payable only in respect of days of unemployment. It is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment or self-employment, irrespective of the number of hours worked or the amount of remuneration or profit received.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit claimants who are engaged in self-employment are not required to sign on at their social welfare local office. As entitlement to a weekly payment of unemployment benefit is dependent on the number of days unemployed, a self-employed person claiming unemployment benefit is required to provide this information weekly on a casual signing docket. The amount of earnings is not requested as it is not relevant in determining entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>However, unemployment assistance, which is a means-tested payment, is payable to a self-employed person whose weekly income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to his or her family circumstances. The rate payable depends on the person's means, which are ascertained by deducting all expenses necessarily incurred from his or her gross income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans at present to amend the legislation governing unemployment payments for self-employed people. If the Deputy has a particular case where difficulties have arisen I will be glad to have it examined. I should also mention that my Department's back to work enterprise allowance is specifically designed to support unemployed people who take up self-employment opportunities. The allowance, which is available to those who are at least 23 years of age and signing on for 12 months or more, lasts for a period of four years and is paid at the rate of <Col N="391" /> 100% of the unemployment payment for the first year, 75% for the second year, 50% for the third year and 25% for the final year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 615 and 621 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme operated by my Department to assist people in setting up their own businesses is specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed who need additional support in this regard over and above the services available otherwise for this purpose. Both the back to work allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance, formerly known as area allowance enterprise schemes, have been very successful in encouraging over 64,000 long-term unemployed to take up employment and self-employment opportunities. They form an integral part of my Department's employment support services designed to activate the long-term unemployed to leave the live register.</P>
      <P>At present 19,100 participants are in self-employment and 18,500 in employment with the support of the scheme. The focus of the schemes must remain on the long-term unemployed, that is, those who have been unemployed for at least 12 months. Demand for the schemes is still buoyant and I am anxious to ensure that the schemes continue to be available to those who need them most to help them break out of the cycle of long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>A report by consultants on the scheme was published in November 1997. A further evaluation of the scheme is being carried out and a draft report by the consultants has been received. I will review the scheme in the light of the consultant's final recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 617 and 618 together.</P>
      <P>I have set out the position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births on a number of occasions to this House in the recent past. Briefly, the position is that, prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, in fulfilment of our pre-election commitments. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998 at a full-year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>In the interim, I have also provided for very substantial additional investments in the child benefit scheme. The 1999 budget provided for an additional full-year investment in the scheme of more than £40 million, while the recent budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million. From September of this year, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including families with twins, and represent the most effective use of the available resources.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing for the double child benefit payments for twins is estimated at some £5.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract were raised with the EU Commission by a third party and were referred to the Department. Responses to the complaints, which raise a number of complex legal issues, have been sent to the Commission.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a new contract cannot be resumed until the issues raised with the Commission have been resolved. In the meantime, the Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide social welfare payment delivery services on an interim basis.</P>

If a request were received to display archaeological material in Kilkenny, it would be assessed on the basis of the loan policy of the National Museum of Ireland and on the basis of section 68 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The National Museum of Ireland has many objects from County Kilkenny in its collections, both on exhibition and in its research and reserve collections. No separate lists of this material currently exist, but the museum would be happy to facilitate researchers in compiling such lists from its archives, as has already been done for Tipperary South Riding County Museum and Clare County Museum.</P>

      <P>The site which the Deputy refers to is within the Ox Mountain Bogs (Blanket Bog) SAC. It is in the middle of an extensive area of undeveloped bog.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 643, 648, 671 and 694 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market, the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years. The intake of property transactions by the Land Registry has increased from 91,060 in 1993 to 133,000 in 1999. Arrears have built up despite the significant efficiencies that have been generated by the Registries which has led to an increase of 35% in the overall output of transactions completed by the Registry.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to take this opportunity to inform the Deputy that, following the case I made to the Department of Finance for the allocation of additional staff to the Land Registry, sanction has very recently been received to increase the core numbers of the staff of the Land Registry by 77. The allocation of the additional staff within the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has yet to be decided and the needs of the Western region along with those of the other regions will be taken into account when the decision is being made.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the main reason for the difference in the level of service delivered to customers in the Dublin and the western regions is due to the fact that only a small number of folios in the western region have so far been computerised. I am satisfied that the provision of additional staff, together with the implementation of the new title registration information system in the western region, which commenced operation in September 1999, will in time offer a much improved level of delivery of services to customers in that area. I am also satisfied that these measures obviate the need to have recourse to the Deputy's suggestion regarding the employment of former employees.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the law on barring orders was the subject of a comprehensive review which led to enactment of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>Various issues concerning the protection of persons from violence in the home continue to be reviewed by my Department. The Government has already established the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women which is chaired by Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State in my Department and includes representatives from the key Government Departments, the Garda Síochána and non-Governmental organisations. As part of the process of review the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 are being examined in the light of experience gained in the first few years of its operation.</P>
      <P>The Law Society through its Law Reform Committee and Women's Aid have suggested certain changes to the Act. These include an extension in the categories of person who are entitled to apply for a barring order to persons with a child in common who have never lived together and the issue is one which has been identified to me by the National Steering Committee. Where changes are found to be feasible and warranted I shall include them in the context of the proposed Family Law Bill which is referred to in the Government's legislation programme. The programme, as announced by the Government Chief Whip on 25 January, 2000, indicates that the heads of proposals for the Bill are in the course of being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>At present, family law cases throughout the country can be heard at the appropriate local court venue which has jurisdiction in the matter at circuit and district court level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1998 the Working Group on a Courts Commission made its final report to me which included recommendations on the future development of family law courts. These recommendations are currently being considered by the Courts Service which was established by me on 9 November 1999 to oversee the general management and administration of the courts. Moreover, one of the key issues in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium is the establishment of regional family courts. The courts service has been informed of this Govern<Col N="404" /> ment objective in the context of the development of Courts Service policy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have approved significant additional funding for the improvement of court accommodation by the new Courts Service throughout the country. Where court accommodation is being replaced or upgraded, special facilities are being put in place for family law.</P>

      <P>A closed circuit television system called video link was installed in the Four Court in 1993 to facilitate evidence given by victims of sexual offences under 17 years of age as provided for in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. There are six courtrooms and two remote witness rooms cabled for video link at the Four Courts and the system is used by the District, Circuit and Central Criminal Courts. The question of the need to provide video link facilities at provincial venues is currently under examination. In the meantime, under the 1992 Act, cases can be transferred from venues which do not have video link facilities to a venue which has such facilities.</P>
      <P>Section 15(1), (2), (3) and 16(1)(b) of the Act of 1992 have not yet been brought into operation. These sections provide for admitting in evidence video recordings of statements made by alleged victims under 14 years of age of sexual or violent offences to a member of the Garda Síochána or other competent person. In October 1998 I established a committee to draw up guidelines for those who will be involved in video recording the statements of such victims. The committee made an interim report to me in October 1999. When the committee has completed its work I will be in a position to commence the relevant sections of the 1992 Act in full.</P>

Cases of child abuse are recorded under a number of headings, according to the nature of the offence. In order to extract statistics for the number of such crimes that relate to children, it would be necessary to examine each recorded offence, in order to classify it according to the age of the victim. The Deputy will understand that the information as requested is not readily available, and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to previous debate in the House on 24 June 1999 (Dail Debates, Cols. 40 to 51) when the House approved the exercise by the State of the option to take part in the adoption and application of a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. That proposal was presented by the European Commission under the EC Treaty as amended by the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam dealing with judicial co-<Col N="406" /> operation in civil matters, in particular, which came into operation on 1 May 1999. It mirrors the essential provisions of the convention, generally referred to as the &ldquo;Brussels 11 Convention&rdquo; and, for those member states which will be a party to it, in effect, supersedes that convention. The regulation is expected to be adopted by the EU Council this year and, as the Deputy will appreciate, it will, unlike the convention, have direct effect in national law.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Courts Service was established by me on 9 November 1999 and has taken over responsibility from local authorities for the provision and maintenance of courthouses.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the courts service that it is preparing a five to seven year building programme at present to upgrade its court building stock which had fallen into disrepair over a long period of time. I have provided a capital budget of 13.5 million this year which will allow the Courts Service to complete a number of projects and to commence work on some new ones.

    <P>With regard to Drogheda, I am aware of the poor courtroom conditions which exist in Drogheda at present. The staff of the District Court are located in temporary office accommodation. I am anxious to ensure that modern court facilities are provided in Drogheda as quickly as possible and I know that the Courts Service is committed to providing a new courthouse in Drogheda as part of its building programme. The Courts Service has adopted a protocol on consultation with court users and in line with this protocol all court users will be consulted regarding the facilities to be provided in the new courthouse in <Col N="407" /> Drogheda. I have been informed by the Courts Service that the design team is now in place and that the project is in the early stages of planning and that the project will go to tender in the autumn and construction will commence on site at the end of this year. There is provision in the Courts Service Act, 1998, for the transfer of property in each local authority area. The vesting arrangements in respect of Drogheda, is not expected to delay the project.</P>
    <P>In relation to delays in hearing cases by the Circuit Court, I have been advised by the Courts Service that in County Louth there is no delay in hearing criminal or family law matters and in civil matters the delay in hearing cases has been reduced from two years to six months.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and subsequent regulations, applicants for legal services are required to satisfy a test of financial eligibility. The present eligibility limit is £7,350 per annum disposable income. Disposable income is defined as the income that remains after certain statutory allowances have been granted.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary to go to court, an applicant's capital resources are taken into account. The maximum disposable capital which an applicant may have is £200,000. The value of the applicant's net capital resources e.g. house, land, money in the bank, car are assessed and a capital contribution may be payable.</P>
      <P>On the general issue, I can say that the question of increasing the income and capital limits has recently been raised by the board and is at present under review. I should point out that the limits were changed on four past occasions viz. 1981, 1986, 1991, and 1995.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they consider facilities at the Immigration Registration Office, Harcourt Square to be totally inadequate but that the Garda have not advised persons to begin queueing at 6.30 a.m. A number of measures have been taken to improve the service provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I too am concerned about reports that non-nationals attending at the IRO are experiencing inconvenience and my Department is in consultation with the Garda about how the situation <Col N="409" /> might be alleviated possibly through the provision of alternative suitable accommodation.</P>

      <Quest>the evaluation, if any, he has carried out on the efficiency and effectiveness of the small claims court; if this has included any survey of the satisfaction levels of clients; the number of claims; the speed of processing; and the speed of enforcement in the event of default by respondents.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims within the district court structure which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the Small Claims Registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. Should this prove unsuccessful the claim will go before the District Court judge. The small claims procedure was initially introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 and was extended nation-wide in 1993 following on from the success of the pilot scheme. The current fee payable for using the procedure is £6.</P>
      <P>To avail of the procedure a person must have bought goods or services for private use from someone selling them in the course of business. Claims may be made for bad workmanship or faulty goods as far as most everyday transactions are concerned but not or debts or personal injuries. When the scheme was extended in 1993, the non-return of rent deposits and minor damage to privately-owned property were included. The operation of the small claims procedure was reviewed in 1999 and examined such issues as the monetary limit which applies, the scope of the procedure and the fees payable under it. Following the review, I increased the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure from £600 to £1,000. While the review did not include a survey of the satisfaction levels of clients of the procedure, I am aware that the procedure is perceived generally as being a success due to its consumer orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the procedure, the person making the claim is called the &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; and the person against whom the claim is made is called the &ldquo;respondent&rdquo;. If a claim is made and is not disputed by the respondent, an order is made for the payment of the amount sought. Should the respondent dispute or counterclaim, the Small Claims Registrar may interview and-or invite both parties to discuss the claim in an effort to reach agreement. If no agreement can be reached the case is listed for court. If the court finds in favour of the applicant, it will make a formal order for the amount claimed. Likewise, the procedure provides that if the respondent does not reply to the claim within a set period the claim is <Col N="410" /> automatically treated as undisputed and an order is made by the registrar for the amount claimed. Both parties to the case are then notified of the order and, in so far as enforcement in concerned, if payment is not made, the matter can be referred to the relevant city or county sheriff in Dublin or Cork, or county registrar elsewhere for execution. In the event of the matter being referred to the sheriff a further fee of £6 will apply, but this amount will be refunded if the sheriff succeeds in executing the court order. This may be done in any case where a party does not comply with the court order.</P>
    <P>I will forward statistical data on the small claims procedure for 1998 for the Deputy's information which, <i>inter alia</i>, sets out the number of decrees enforced by sheriffs in 1998 and the number which were not enforced. As sheriffs are independent in the exercise of their duties, information as to the timescales for these enforcements is not available.</P>
    <P>For the first 12 month period of the scheme's operation in 1993-94, a total of 2,216 applications were received. This number has increased by 22% in 1998 to 2,706. Over the duration of the scheme, the registrars have consistently managed to settle approximately 50% of all cases. Of the remaining cases, approximately 20% proceed to a full court hearing. The remaining 30% includes cases where decrees are issued by default, claims which are withdrawn, or claims not covered by the small claims procedure.</P>

    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities are constantly monitoring their fine collection systems with a view to improving collection rates. I am informed that, in this regard, consideration is being given by the gardaí to the introduction of a credit card payment system into Garda stations throughout the state which could further boost the voluntary payment rates of fines from out of state drivers as well as local drivers.</P>
    <P>In relation to civil cases involving damage to motor vehicles and property, I am further informed by the Garda authorities that under the EU directive on compulsory insurance (No. 72/166) mechanically propelled vehicles normally based in other EU member states and vehicles in third countries associated with the European Union are covered by an agreement between the <Col N="415" /> National Insurance Bureau of the member states and the &ldquo;Associated Countries&rdquo; whereby the settlement of claims in respect of accidents is guaranteed even where the vehicle is not insured.

It includes a seminar on ethnicity, traveller culture and discrimination against the travelling community. Pavee Point make a presentation at this seminar. The social studies course also covers instruction in human rights conferred by the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights and deals with policing and human rights.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Human Rights Initiative 1999-2000 &ldquo;Policing and Human Rights: Promoting Best Practice&rdquo; has as one of its core tasks the further development of human rights training at all levels within the organisation, including human rights training in the context of policing in a multi-ethnic society.</P>
      <P>The legal studies element of the training and education programme provides instruction in the relevant provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, and other relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>During the final phase of training for Garda recruits members from the Garda Síochána community relations section attend at the Garda College to conduct a seminar at which issues concerning policing in a diverse and pluralist society are explored.</P>
      <P>Similar training is provided at the Garda College for Garda supervisors and managers and designated Garda immigration officers deployed at ports of entry to the State. Inservice training schools throughout the country also provide training in policing in a multi-ethnic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1999 the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by the EU Commission and the Government, entitled &ldquo;Providing a police service in a developing multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Ireland&rdquo;. They are to be congratulated on this early initiative and their foresight and openness in addressing this question. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. In particular, the training currently provided to student and probationer gardaí is being reviewed and enhanced in the light of the outcomes of this conference. In fact, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a working group has been established to review all aspects of Garda training in <Col N="419" /> this area and to develop best practices in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment. The group has an ambitious work programme and its activities are ongoing.</P>
    <P>A follow-up conference is planned for this year. Entitled Intercultural Ireland &ndash; Identifying the Policing Challenges, it will be co-hosted by the Garda Síochána, my Department and the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>There are no Garda liaison officers assigned to Dublin Garda stations to liaise with refugees and immigrant communities. However, the Garda authorities are committed, via community policing arrangements in particular, to the development of partnership with local communities, including local communities where refugees and immigrants are resident, and Garda structures for dealing with specific policing issues are kept under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Garda Complaints Board does not categorise or classify complaints in a manner that would make it possible to determine the proportion, if any, relating to ethnic or racial issues.</P>

      <P>To this end, my Department is nearing completion of a comprehensive review of the Act and its operation, which has involved consultations with and-or consideration of proposals from a wide range of interested parties, including the Complaints Board itself, Garda authorities, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Garda staff associations etc. In this regard, the Complaints Board's Third Report on the operation of the Act has proved particularly useful in the identification of possible areas of legislative amendment, and I would hope, accordingly, to be in a position to bring proposals to Government at an early date.</P>
      <P>With regard to the High Court judicial review referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the matter has been appealed to the Supreme Court. The implications, if any, of the outcome of this Supreme Court review will be addressed in an appropriate fashion.</P>

      <P>The numbers of deportation orders signed in 1999 in respect of failed asylum seekers and persons to whom the Dublin Convention applied are 79 and 15 respectively. In January 1999, the High Court ruled that my power to deport was unconstitutional. This necessitated the passage by the Oireachtas of the Immigration Act, 1999, to restore the power in a way which complied with the Constitution. The absence of a power to deport for a large part of 1999 meant that the number of deportation orders made was lower than in 1998. No such orders have been made to date in 2000 in respect of failed asylum seekers or persons to whom the Dublin Convention applies. A total of 305 deportation orders <Col N="421" /> were signed in 1998. The large majority of these orders would have been in respect of failed asylum seekers or persons covered by the Dublin Convention but precise figures are not readily to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 680 and 687 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> The offence of unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. The legislation pertaining to the investigation of criminal damage e.g. burning out cars is defined under section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act ,1991.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of the Garda Síochána shows the number of unauthorised taking of vehicles as 13,793 in 1998, 13,589 in 1997 and 13,405 in 1 996. These statistics contrast with the 1983 total of 19,484 cases of unauthorised taking.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the legislation in force is adequate to cover the present situation. I should state however that any amendment to road traffic legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is responsible for all road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>I have been further assured by the Garda authorities that the strategies currently in place to combat joy riding and other criminal damage are reviewed periodically and changes to tactics are made where necessary to ensure continued effectiveness.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's concern about persistent offending, I wish to assure the Deputy that persons serving sentences for persistent offences related to so called joyriding offences are not granted early temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances. There are no proposals to introduce mandatory prison sentences for these offences.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1999, which is at present before the House, provides for the development of a new juvenile justice system and contains many innovative measures for dealing with young offenders.</P>
    <P>My Department currently supports and funds programmes in disadvantaged areas &ndash; generally referred to as Garda youth diversion schemes &ndash; which are community based and are designed to draw people away from crime. Through the combined efforts of local agencies, these projects aim at identifying the young people at risk and assessing intervention programmes to service their needs, promoting productive and creative use of the target groups leisure time with a view to enabling their integration into main stream youth activity groups; and liaising closely with parents, schools, other agencies and the community in general. Other preventative and proactive interventions have been developed in local communities by the Probation and Welfare Service, such as the auto crime diversion project in Cork City.</P>

      <P>As current Garda accommodation at the location in question does not meet optimum standards for operational activities, I am pleased to state that it is planned to replace the existing Garda station with a new, purpose-built &lsquo;basic unit'-type station. However, progress on the matter is dependent upon securing a suit<Col N="426" /> able site in the locality, overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in the interim, consideration is being given to a scheduling of some basic &lsquo;bridging' maintenance works to the station and, to this end, the Office of Public Works has provided indicative costings for such development. It is not possible to provide a precise time frame for progress, however, as work at the location in question must be considered within the context of the priority maintenance requirements of the entire stock of Garda accommodation.</P>

Pending the entry into force of section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which deals with applications for family reunification, my Department applies the criteria set out therein on an administrative basis. The applications in question were refused because it was not established that the applicants came within the definition of &ldquo;dependent member of the family of a refugee&rdquo; as provided for in section 18 of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that when the registration of Dealing No. 91 GY 4821 was completed on 15 March 1999, while the ownership details of the applicants referred to by the Deputy wee correctly registered, the notice of completion of the dealing inadvertently referred to Folio 28614F Co. Galway instead of Folio 51494F Co. Galway. The solicitor applied for a copy of the Folio 28614F Co. Galway on 24 September 1999 and this issued on 16 November 1999. However, as the Deputy is aware, this was the wrong folio. The Registrar of Titles regrets any inconvenience caused by the error, and will rectify it urgently Her staff are <Col N="427" /> attempting to contact the registered owners today.</P>
      <P>In relation to the level of service given by the Land Registry, I would refer the Deputy to the positive developments in relation to the staffing of the Land Registry which I have set out in my reply to a number of other questions tabled by the Deputy for answer today.</P>

I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to ensure that the level of facilities for Dublin Institute of Technology students improve and, accordingly, the Government recently decided to sanction the purchase of 65 acres of the Eastern Health Board's property at Grangegorman for Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The development of this property will provide Dublin Institute of Technology and its students with a campus and facilities on a par with any other third level institution.</P>

    <P>There is already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions.

    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools.  Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to request the approval of the Government for the publication in the near future of the Teaching Council Bill. It is proposed that the principal function of the teaching council will be to regulate the teaching profession and the professional affairs of teachers through the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers and the maintenance of high professional standards.</P>
      <P>In replying to this question it is assumed that what the Deputy has in mind is bullying of teachers by colleagues or senior staff. It is my intention that the council will have adequate powers to deal with such behaviour which I consider to be serious misconduct and unprofessional behaviour. The council, once established, will be responsible for the establishment, review and maintenance of a code of professional conduct for teachers. It is in that context that the issue of bullying can most effectively be specifically addressed rather than singling it out in the Bill as a particular form of misconduct. Breaches of the code of conduct will trigger grievance or disciplinary procedures in the first instance in most cases at school level and can also be the subject of inquiries by the council itself, leading, in cases of serious misconduct to removal from the register.</P>

The course was first provided in 1995-96. It was repeated in 1997-98 and a further course is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>Future intake and output requirements in primary teacher training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department, the colleges and the Higher Education Authority. The need for a further postgraduate course for primary teaching was considered in that context and it was decided to run another course to commence in February 2000. This course has been extensively advertised in the media.</P>
      <P>If the ongoing review process identifies the need for a further course, consultation will take place with the colleges of education on the timing of such a course. At this juncture it is not possible to say if or when that will happen.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, provisional recognition has been granted to teachers trained outside the State to teach in primary schools for a period of two years to enable them acquire the Irish language qualification by passing the special examination Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. Such teachers were paid at a reduced rate of salary for the period of provisional recognition.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that, with effect from September 1999, teachers holding provisional recognition to work in primary schools will be paid on the common basic scale from the outset. Furthermore, I have arranged that such teachers will be facilitated in their preparations for the SCG examination by the provision of regional courses through the education centre network. I have also decided that the costs to teachers of attending residential courses in the Gaeltacht as part of the SCG preparations will in future be met by my Department when the teacher passes the examination.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced further improvements to facilitate teachers in preparing for and taking the SCG. Firstly, I have extended the period of provisional recognition from two to three years. In addition, teachers will now be able to sit different parts of the examination at different times, and those who pass individual modules of the examination will be exempt from these modules for a period of five years. Furthermore, candidates will be able to view their worked examination scripts in my Department's offices in Athlone, while all oral examinations are now being recorded on audio-tape. Finally, the examination is now held twice a year so that candidates will have at least six opportunities to sit the examination during the three year period of provisional recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the teachers referred to by <Col N="440" /> the Deputy were trained in Northern Ireland and have provisional recognition to teach in primary schools in this State. The Deputy will be pleased to know that these teachers will benefit from the improvements I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>I set up a working group in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The working group presented its report to me in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The report recommended, as one of a number of measures, that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing new furniture and equipment is, in general, considered as part of a new school construction, extension or refur<Col N="441" /> bishment project. Since coming into Government I have increased the level of funding for primary and second level school accommodation by 188%. This increased funding has resulted in a significant increase in the number of projects which can be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced some months ago that, with effect from the beginning of the current school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme would have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education.</P>
      <P>The actual entitlement of an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils qualify for the allocation of a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 qualify for the allocation of 0.5 of a post.</P>
      <P>In the vocational sector the teacher allocation is generally determined on a VEC scheme basis rather than on an individual school basis. In the case of County Meath VEC, the teacher allocation for the current school year includes an ex-quota allocation of six wholetime teacher equivalents in respect of remedial. This compares with an allocation of three wholetime teacher equivalents for remedial for the 1998-99 school year. In addition, the scheme has been allocated a number of disadvantaged posts.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the chief executive officer, with the agreement of the VEC, to allocate teaching resources to individual schools in the scheme from within the overall approved allocation.</P>

The results will be set out in a report which will issue to the school board of management shortly after the whole school evaluation takes place.

      <P>At primary level the whole school evaluation report will contain evaluative judgments on all aspects of school life, including pupils' attainment in literacy. Evidence underpinning the judgments made on a school's literacy levels will be collated from a range of sources, including pupils' performance in standardised, norm-referenced reading tests in evaluating literacy levels in the school. These tests, which are developed in Ireland and which are in use in many schools, are based on national norms in literacy attainment.</P>

Plans are already under way to carry out a survey of all primary schools in the country to establish the levels of concentration in them of children who are at risk of educational disadvantage. Tiers of supports that will reflect levels of need will then be put in place in support of the schools and of the children who attend them.</P>
      <P>My Department has a support teacher project in operation in 48 schools in which there are significant numbers of pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviours. Forty two support teachers work in the schools on two levels. They support the targeted children's learning through individual and group work. Together with the principal, the class teacher and the remedial teacher, they form part of a vital support team in delivering a comprehensive learning support that addresses the individual needs of children with behaviours that have a negative impact on their own learning and also on the learning of their peers. The support teachers also make a significant contribution to the development of school policy on behavioural management and on the development of appropriate management strategies and skills. A comprehensive in-career development programme supports the project development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999, I extended the home-school-community liaison scheme to provide a liaison service for the remaining primary and post-primary schools that are designated by my Department as serving areas of disadvantage and <Col N="446" /> did not already have the service. An important dimension of the liaison service is the support and development of parents' self-confidence and capacity to fulfil their roles as primary educators and to collaborate with schools in the education of their children.</P>
    <P>Counselling and guidance supports for children in primary schools are within the pastoral care remit of the teaching staff of the schools. Children in need of more formal counselling must be referred to appropriately qualified and insured personnel subject to normal constraints such as parental consultation and permission. My Department is not immediately aware of any submissions relating to this issue. However, counselling practitioners seeking involvement with my Department in the delivery of formal counselling services are appraised of this approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is of course already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions.

In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substan<Col N="447" /> tial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools.

      <Quest>if he will ensure that capitation charges levied by the third level institutions will have a ceiling imposed on them in order that they do not grow exponentially; and if he will further ensure that any future increases will be kept below the rate of inflation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The capitation charges referred to by Deputy Sargent refer to the standardised charge levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. When introduced, this charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years. At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed. In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year. In line with the 4% increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the charge is not paid by students in receipt of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The universities further increased this charge by 7% to £278 for the current academic year and I would point out that this increase was made without my approval. Section 40 of the Universities Act, 1997, enables a university to determine and charge fees for student registration, courses, lectures, etc. The Higher Education Authority can review, with the universities, the fees charged by the universities and then, having consulted with me, the Higher Education Authority can advise the universities on the fees, which in its opinion, should be charged.  Accordingly, there is no specific statutory requirement for the universities to seek the approval of the Minister for Education and Science for the increase in the student charge. In the light of the increase in the charge being levied by the universities, I agreed to an increase to £278 for the charge payable by students in the Institutes of Technology however, this approval was on the basis that £8 of the increase would be specifically devoted to attrition-access initiatives in the individual institutions.</P>
    <P>Prior to this year, there was agreement as to the level of increase in the charge and my officials are engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities regarding an agreed procedure for reviewing fee levels in the future.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase maintenance grants for third level students in view of the fact that current rates are lower than student costs even without the considerations of exorbitant rents being charged for rented accommodation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously indicated my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants schemes before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels and income limits. Accordingly, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the value of maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.</P>
      <P>My initial priority was to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have honoured that commitment and introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from <Col N="449" /> the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, there is provision for a third level access fund totalling £95 million. This fund will be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to provide financial support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grant schemes. Details of this additional support will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the issue of student accommodation, I would point out to the Deputy that the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the serious supply pressure which exists in relation to student accommodation. Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically to relieve some of the pressure by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students and therefore I do not propose to intervene further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate <Col N="451" /> schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant.</P>
      <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issuing of these grants to schools. Due to the need to develop an IT programme, and the necessity to verify all school enrolments for September 1999, it is expected that these grants will issue to schools in March of this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget, over the next two years, which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
      <P>The position regarding Scoil Áine, Raheny is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with Scoil Eithne, Edenmore under the 1978 scheme. There is no provision at the moment for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts that are being shared. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, Scoil Áine also currently receives £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme.</P>
      <P>The position of schools such as Scoil Áine will be borne in mind in working out details for the implementation of the additional £9 million referred to above. However the first priority will be to provide for secretarial and caretaking assistance for those schools that are currently not assisted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils within the primary education system who have a specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where necessary, of the remedial teacher service. Since the commencement of the current school year, the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country.</P>
      <P>All fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. There are currently 1,465 remedial teachers in place in the primary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> Second level pupils with a specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Children of primary school age, whose condition is of a more serious nature, may also be capable of attending their local primary school where they can be supported by the special resource teacher service. In this connection, I would point out that arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. School authorities and other interested groups have been informed of this development and of the procedures to be followed in seeking access to special support services. Already, as a result of this development, there has been a substantial increase in the number of resource teachers and special needs assistants allocated to support special needs children in the primary system.</P>
    <P>For some children, the severity of their condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to an ordinary school is the required response. There are four such special schools at present. Three of these are located in the Dublin area and one in Cork.</P>
    <P>Special classes can also be established in ordinary primary schools to cater for children with specific learning disability where a need for such provision has been identified. There are 16 such classes in place at present and further classes will be established as required.</P>
    <P>A reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1 is applicable in all special facilities catering for the children in question. Children placed in such facilities also attract enhanced levels of capitation funding at a rate of £263 for children under 12 years of age and £423 for children of 12 years and over.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides grants to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment to assist pupils with special needs, including those with specific learning disability. Allocations of equipment grants are based on the assessed need of individual pupils. In 1999 a total of £800,000 was allocated for special materials/equipment in the primary sector. A further £250,000 was also made available for children with special needs under the IT 2000 programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the range of in-school supports identified above, my Department is continuing to support the work carried out in this area by the association for children and adults with learning disabilities. In the current year, an allocation of £50,000 will be made to that association.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of special support services provided by my Department constitute a very significant response to the educational needs of students with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia, within the education system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> I intend to continue to monitor developments in this area to ensure that adequate provision continues to be made available to the pupils in question.</P>

      <P>I received a proposal regarding the introduction of drama to the primary school curriculum, via the Taoiseach's office, in May of last year from the person referred to by the Deputy. I issued a reply to the Office of the Taoiseach, outlining the situation that pertains in relation to drama in the primary curriculum on 24 August 1999.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that drama formed part of the primary school curriculum that was introduced in 1971. It also forms part of the revised curriculum that was introduced to all primary schools at the beginning of this school year.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the importance of drama lessons and the revised curriculum deals not only with the elements of voice production and acting talent, but also emphasises the benefits to be gained from exploring life through the creation of plot, theme, fiction and make-believe. It should also be noted that primary school teachers are required to be able to teach all aspects of the curriculum, including drama, to all age groups at primary level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I have been committed to ensuring the maximum possible participation of traveller children in the education system and the delivery of an education service which is appropriate to the needs of these children.</P>
      <P>At present, traveller children have access to a range of special support services to facilitate their participation in the education system. These services extend from special provision at pre-school level to support services to encourage participation in the first and second level systems.</P>
      <P>At pre-school level, significant development has taken place in recent years and a total of 52 pre-school classes are now catering for approximately 520 traveller children. My Department funds 98% of the tuition costs involved and also the cost of transporting the children to and from the pre-schools.</P>
      <P>At primary level, a total of approximately 400 resource teachers have been allocated to cater specifically for traveller children. The children in question are generally taught in integrated settings within the ordinary classroom where the resource teacher works in partnership with the ordinary class teacher. Where necessary, the children can be withdrawn in small groups for intensive periods of tuition according to their perceived needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Traveller children are also supported by the visiting teacher service for travellers. A total of 30 visiting teachers are currently engaged in delivering this service. The primary function of the visiting teacher is to identify suitable educational placements for traveller children; encourage the children to attend school; and motivate and support the parents to take an active interest in their childrens' education. It is my intention to expand this service further in the coming years in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
    <P>A national education officer for travellers is charged with responsibility for promoting and facilitating the education of traveller children on a national basis. The national education officer works closely with my Department; the visiting teacher service; and traveller organisations.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made on the participation of traveller children in the second level education system. Second level schools catering for traveller children are now entitled to an allocation of ex-quota teaching hours in respect of all traveller children enrolled.</P>
    <P>In addition, first and second level schools attract a special increased rate of capitation funding in respect of every traveller child enrolled.</P>
    <P>I believe that my decision to establish the advisory committee on traveller education will prove to be of particular importance in the future development of education services for the traveller community. The fact that the membership of this committee includes representatives of traveller organisations is intended to ensure that the travellers themselves have, for the first time, a real voice in shaping educational provision for future generations of traveller children.</P>

      <P>My Department has agreed to undertake a review of the organisational, management, technical, administrative and ancillary service needs of centres catering for large numbers of PLC <Col N="459" /> students. The term designated centres has been used in discussions in that context, but should not be interpreted as meaning future provision would be confined to such centres.

The terms of reference for the study are being finalised in consultation with teacher and management interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant.</P>
      <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issuing of these grants to schools. Due to the need to develop an IT programme, and the necessity to verify all school enrolments for September 1999, it is expected that these grants will issue to schools in March of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget, over the next two years, which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the school referred to by the Deputy is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement another school under the 1978 scheme. There is no provision at the moment for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts that are being shared. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, the school also currently receives £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme.</P>
    <P>The position of such schools will be borne in mind in working out details for the implementation of the additional £9 million referred to above. However the first priority will be to provide for secretarial and caretaking assistance for those schools that are currently not assisted.</P>

      <P>The management committee of the National Educational Psychological Service agency is currently drawing up a development plan for the phased expansion of its service. The particular needs of all counties, including County Kildare, are being considered in the formulation of this plan. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service by the end of a five year developmental period beginning in 1999. I am happy to inform the Deputy that as part of the first phase of the expansion, the Civil Service Commission has offered positions in NEPS to 25 psychologists and is currently interviewing for a further 25 posts. The successful applicants from the first competition will begin to take up their positions in the National Educational Psychological Service agency early in 2000.</P>

      <P>I myself met with the INTO to discuss the recommendations of the report of the working group which I established to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Further discussions have taken place between officials of my Department and the INTO to examine the issues involved. As a consequence of these discussions proposals made by my Department regarding the appointment of additional administrative principals and the provision of substitute cover to enable teaching principals in small national schools be released from their duties for specified periods annually are currently under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is of course already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures in schools which have been developed in recent <Col N="462" /> years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the plight of a pupil from a multi-denominational primary school who is finding it extremely difficult to obtain non-denominational second level education in his area; and the proposals, if any, he has to address this emerging problem which will shortly affect other pupils.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant characteristic of second level education is the range of school types in the system, including voluntary secondary schools, vocational schools, community colleges, community schools and comprehensive schools. I expect that all post-primary schools, regardless of type or ethos, would employ flexible strategies which would enable them to accommodate children of different or non-denominational backgrounds. This expectation is now underpinned by the Education Act, a specific objective of which is &ldquo;to promote equality of access to and participation in education and to promote the means whereby students may benefit from education&rdquo;.</P>
