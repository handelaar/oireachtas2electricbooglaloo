      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business I take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann a parliamentary delegation from the National Assembly of Quebec who are here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann I extend to you a most sincere welcome to our country. I trust that your visit will further strengthen the ties of friendship and co-operation between our two Parliaments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 45, the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 5, the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage; and No. 46, Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>Private Members' business shall be No. 102, motion re inflation (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, does the Taoiseach agree that the aviation industry can only operate if airports are properly run and that there is a problem in regard to the management of our major airport where, for example, airlines are questioning the adequacy of the fire safety arrangements, a number of the check-in desks are not operational and visitors to this country, many of them for the first time, are experiencing a high level of frustration with this public service? They are also frustrated with the DART system for which a fortnight ago additional carriages were promised immediately but have not yet been introduced. All of these <Col N="818" /> services have one thing in common &ndash; they are run by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter could be raised more appropriately by way of parliamentary question, but I will allow the Taoiseach to make a brief comment given that the Leader of the Opposition has raised the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated there was a question about safety regulation. Dublin Airport has received safety regulation clearance from Fingal County Council and I do not think that matter arises. A large amount of construction work was under way at the airport and it is now finished. Most of the new areas are operational. We predicted in the House in 1994 that by 2007 10 million people would pass through Dublin Airport, but the airport is catering for more than 14 million people with 500 flights on most Saturdays throughout the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the massive increases in revenue accruing to the State, as reported in today's newspapers, is the Government prepared to bring in immediate legislation to compensate old age pensioners and others exclusively dependent on social welfare payments whose increases in the last budget have effectively been wiped out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about legislative proposals. Such a change would require legislation. These people do not have the opportunity to see Dublin Airport and in light of the extraordinary increase in money that this Government has at its disposal and because of its failure to manage the economy properly, the benefits of the increases have been eroded. The Government has the cash.</P>

      <P>Given the number of deaths on the roads as a result of car accidents and the obvious concern of the Minister concerned, when is it intended to bring forward amending legislation on road traffic safety? Will it include provisions to require gardaí to wear their seat belts? Most of them seem to think they are compelled not to wear such belts.</P>

      <P>You have informed me this morning, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is not responsible for RTE's annual report. Is the Taoiseach aware of this, despite the fact that it <Col N="820" /> accounts for £65 million of the television licence fee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware, as I am, of the scientific view that weather patterns, particularly at sea, are becoming steadily worse? In view of the loss of life among the fishing community, will he act more urgently on such legislation as the Irish Energy Centre Bill which is supposed to deal with the rising levels of greenhouse gases? Why was that legislation put back to early 2001 given that the last legislative list stated it would be taken in late 2000? In May 1999, the Taoiseach said the heads of the Bill would be ready by July 1999. Why is this legislation being pushed back further and further when people are losing their lives and scientific opinion is pointing towards the need to curtail greenhouse gases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the legislation to establish the Irish Energy Centre under departmental aegis, the heads of the Bill were approved just before the summer recess. The legislation is being drafted as quickly as possible. We have had some tragic accidents at sea and I know that everybody in the House will join with me in extending their sympathy to the bereaved families. The Marine Institute has published some very good research on this issue and continues to undertake research on wave patterns and climatic changes in the Atlantic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the report of the commission on the private rental sector, are there any plans to introduce legislation to give effect to its recommendations in view of the fact that many elderly people and students are being charged exorbitant rents? Is the Taoiseach happy to leave the <i>status quo</i> unchanged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That report is being studied by the housing forum. There is no legislation as yet, but following that examination there might well be.</P>

      <P>The Equal Status Bill was enacted by the Oireachtas in the last session and it was announced that it would be implemented on 1 October, yet that has not happened. When is it intended to bring the Equal Status Act into force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> In view of the fact that safety seems to be very much in vogue, including safety at Dublin Airport and safety on our roads, I wish to ask the Taoiseach about legislation concerning rail safety. He will be aware that rail safety was one of the central issues in the rail strike during the summer, which cost Iarnród Éireann £10 million, paralysed the tourism industry and played havoc with the economy of rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach contemplate whether separate legislative provision could not be made to devote moneys that have accrued so far from the DIRT inquiry, which amount to £153 million, to some purpose that would benefit the main losers during that decade of tax evasion? It should not be sucked into the general maw of the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to correct the record of yesterday when I asked him about legislation in respect of victims of child abuse? Today we have not only heard the Minister promising legislation but also indicating that the Cabinet decided upon it yesterday. I am not so churlish as to decline to welcome this legislation, although it is very belated. Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify that it is now intended to introduce legislation in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am forced to say to the <Col N="822" /> Deputy that it is a pity the matter was not addressed many years ago when it first arose. I will not get into that, however, because it is an important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The decision to allow for a compensation tribunal was cleared at the Cabinet yesterday but the finalisation of the report will be completed over the next few weeks and the heads will then be cleared. We would hope to have the legislation in this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday and today the Taoiseach has suggested that legislation is not promised on the private rented housing sector. Last year, when I was asking questions about this matter, he indicated that legislation would follow the report of the commission on the private rented sector. When the report came out, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said that proposals would be brought to Government in September. Will the Government introduce legislation to provide protection for tenants in the private rented sector following the report of the commission, which has been published since July? Has the Government decided to shelve that entirely or to kick it aside into another committee for another year?</P>

      <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Despite that and the fact that landlords in the Fianna Fáil Party obviously see no urgency for legislation to protect tenants either, can the Taoiseach provide a definitive timescale for legislation to end the grotesque exploitation of those dependent on private rented accommodation, to control rents and give security of tenure? We must have an answer today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that. The report itself, which came out at the end of July, is being considered by the Government. We also said that we would consult with the housing forum that has just been set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. When that is finished, which hopefully will not be too long, we will announce legislative action if that is necessary.</P>

    <Title>Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of the air transport industry to an island nation could not be overestimated. It is of strategic importance to Ireland that there is a well developed infrastructure and access to this island nation. The importance of safety within that industry is of vital importance. With the increased number of people using our airports and the increased number of companies flying into our airports arising from competition, there is a real danger that corner cutting in the safety regimes will become the norm to make more profits.</P>
      <P>There is a need to strengthen the safety regime to protect the millions of people who now pass through our airport systems. It must be established that self-regulation on safety is not acceptable. Such self-regulation, whether it is on the ground or in the air, should no longer be part of our safety regime. Standards on the ground dictate what will happen later in the air.</P>
      <P>It is important in the public interest to provide for and control our airports. There is a strategic national interest to be protected by the Government and the State on behalf of the people. We should not trust the foreign multinationals or the Irish profit motivated operators to do the best job for the people in regard to guarding this important strategic infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State and its agents will do the best job in this regard for Ireland. There is no case, there<Col N="826" /> fore, for privatisation. If investment is required, the State should invest in the companies that it owns regardless of whether they are airports or airlines. We have a duty to do so. In the interest of the wider economy, it is important to do so and carry out that duty. However, the Government appears to have adopted the attitude of black balling any possibility of investment by the State in any of the companies it owns. It is strange for the owner of a company, which has an abundance of money, to decide not to invest in its own company and that if investment is required, the company should be hived off to what, from the company's point of view, should be considered the enemy.</P>
    <P>The policy adopted by the Minister and the Government has been to let the enemy in the door. This means that not a penny of the billions of extra money available to the Government has been invested in the critically required infrastructure at Dublin Airport. As we read in the newspapers recently and heard this morning on the Order of Business from the leader of the Opposition, there is chaos at Dublin Airport arising from the fact that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, said that she will not even ask the Minister for Finance for money to invest in the airport to make it safe and suitable for the huge number of people who now use it.</P>
    <P>Just as there is no case for the privatisation of Aer Rianta or the airports, there is no case for the privatisation of a national carrier. There is a strategic need for this island nation to have its own airline, controlled by the State on behalf of the people. It would be next to criminal to hand over that national carrier to the loving tender care of the international carpet-baggers who are now at the door because of the indications the Minister gave to them that this sale of the century would be available to them shortly. I warn the Minister and the House that these carpet-baggers will pull out of places such as Ireland on the first downturn of business and leave us without a service. That is the likely consequence of the actions the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in her speech to the privatisation of Aer Lingus. This Bill will enable an independent regulator to make some decisions for which the Minister has responsibility but she does not have the political bottle to carry them out. If there is a difficult or unpopular task to do, the Minister will kick to touch, hive it off or not do it at all. An example is the ESB where it was necessary to rejig the tariffs and to make decisions about power stations, but the Minister appointed a regulator and said he would look after it.</P>

We now have the spectacle of the ESB importing generators from abroad which are normally used to power circuses. The ESB is bringing generators around the country on lorries like a circus because the Minister has not done her job.

The Minister should be surcharged out of her salary for making a decision to pay a public official who cannot do his job. She had no authority to appoint a regulator until this Bill passed both Houses of the Oireachtas but, strangely, she appointed a person to a position in which he cannot operate. None of the aspects of his office can come into operation until this Bill is passed and it is a long way from being passed because there are major flaws in it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the fact that a highly paid person who has been appointed by the Minister without authority cannot do a job to which she suggested he should be appointed. Perhaps she might tell us in her reply why this person was appointed in advance of the legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing in this Bill with regulations and the broad issue of regulation therefore arises. The Minister pretended to debate this issue in a paper she produced recently in which she said, or the officials who wrote the paper for her said, that ownership excluded regulation. The State were the owners, therefore the regulators had to be independent. Lip service was paid by the Minister about accountability and democratic deficits arising from taking the authority out of this House and out of the Minister's office and giving it to people that are unaccountable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I have talked about that since. So the only regulation that was required was State utilities. Strangely, private monopoly groups or major interests did not need regulation. The political dishonesty is that the Minister, knowing full well that she intends to privatise the companies, first put in an independent, non-State regulator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a view that airport regulation arises only in the context of privatisation. That is obvious from some of the contributions. The issues of privatisation and regulation are inextricably linked, particularly in the current debate, but they are separate issues. The debate would be more constructive if they could be kept as far apart as possible, although I must confess that occasionally I stray into mixing them as it is almost impossible not to do so. Regulation is just as valid&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;for State-owned airports as it is for privatised airports.</P>
      <P>The processes of deregulation in the US and Europe are interesting and, in many respects, the results are different. That is something we need to learn because we tend to learn from the experience of our neighbours in the area of regulation and similar areas. We look in particular at the experience of the UK&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is the forerunner in the area of regulation, but the results in the US and Europe are quite different. Some of the results in the UK are quite different from what had been anticipated at the time of the White Paper. Dramatic changes occurred in structure and organisation from deregulation in the US in 1977 and 1978. The results in Europe were far reaching, but were a good deal short of being as dramatic.</P>
      <P>Airport infrastructural constraints are crucial in determining the long-term development of the air transport sector. To date liberalisation has tended to be focused on airlines and routes rather than on airport capacity. In many countries capacity is still controlled directly or indirectly by the State or Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Airport pricing is the issue that tends to be <Col N="839" /> raised in this context all the time, but there are many other issues that are by no means ancillary. They are central to the area of regulation. Over time pricing policy influences the average size of aircraft using airports, the balance between short, medium and long haul services as well as the distribution of all traffic across an airport system, whether within a nation or across the EU. This legislation has the potential to be very far reaching in its impact and import. It has the potential to be a major tool for developing Irish aviation policy for the next ten, 15 or 20 years. It deserves much care and attention. It is an excellent document as drafted, but some parts might need amending, and the Minister has indicated she is open to that.</P>
    <P>While liberalisation has encouraged traffic growth, lack of capacity at larger airports has acted as a barrier. That may be close to happening at Dublin Airport, although I do not accept that Dublin Airport could not be organised to take much more traffic than it does at present. I would like the regulator to be empowered effectively to transfer business to the less congested airports. I am speaking from a regional viewpoint in that Shannon is the obvious candidate for any business that might be diverted. Quite an amount of business comes into Dublin Airport that does not benefit Dublin or its hinterland and effectively has very little business there in the first place.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the UK airports legislation of 1986, which followed the introduction of a White Paper in 1985. It would be of interest to anyone with an interest in aviation. I read it before the summer, but it is now in a large box in transit between where I used to reside and where I am about to reside in the building. I have not had a chance to update myself on it, but I remember parts of it and memory is not always entirely reliable. It was a thorough document and could usefully be visited by anyone who chooses to have an input here. I know the Minister has examined it in considerable detail. That document and the UK experience arising from it, some of which was negative, has had a positive impact on this legislation. One of the considerations in the UK at the time &ndash; perhaps the driving force &ndash; was that airports had a large funding requirement, particularly around London. Some mistakes were made in addressing that which we do not necessarily have to follow. Anyone looking at the situation in Dublin would say that the current infrastructural problems were predictable seven to ten years ago. They were predicted accurately by Aer Rianta in 1995 and 1996 when it made proposals to the then Minister for massive infrastructural improvement. There are questions as to why the Government of the day did not allow Aer Rianta to go ahead with its proposals, as it would have been a lot cheaper and it would have avoided the current difficulties. In general terms we need to look at why that mistake was made here if we look at the mistakes made in the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> It is worth bearing in mind that on a recent Saturday 140 charters used Dublin Airport. There is no doubt as to the need to control and co-ordinate the slots there. One of the worst examples was that of almost 400 pilgrims &ndash; certainly travelling in a full wide-bodied aircraft &ndash; being transported to Lourdes in the middle of the busiest time for the airport, when the transatlantic flights were being dealt with along with a huge number of European flights. That was dictated by the fact that Aer Lingus's scheduling meant there was a free wide-bodied aircraft available at that time, but it was most disruptive for the airport.</P>
    <P>United Airlines, which flies from the United States, has a coach-sharing agreement with British Midland and many of its passengers backtrack into Ireland. British Midland only serves Dublin Airport, so of necessity those passengers must come to Dublin. It does not benefit Dublin or the country to have large numbers of American tourists landing in Dublin Airport and hiring a car to drive to Killarney or Connemara; it is counter-productive. Northwest and other airlines are likely to follow that precedent, but it is foolish for this or any other country to dictate where passengers arrive. One of the areas we are failing to address regarding the huge urban conglomeration of Dublin is that business is being foisted upon it that does not benefit the city and never will. It contributes to further congestion to have people arrive in Dublin who do not want to be there in the first place but who did not have anyone to explain that there were other possibilities open to them.</P>
    <P>I am not referring only to Shannon in regard to such business, particularly European and British flights. These flights could come through Knock, Cork or other regional airports in many instances. That would have the effect of better distribution of income in the country and would also reduce congestion in Dublin. However, I would not envy the Minister her job in persuading greedy Dublin business interests that that was desirable. I do not think she or anyone else would succeed in doing so if that were tried, but in the interests of the country it needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Safety issues have been mentioned and the regulator will have a role in this regard. I do not accept that any airport authority would deliberately place safety issues at the bottom of its agenda, but it is good legislation to ensure that safety issues are dealt with up front in a fitting manner.</P>
    <P>Particular sections of the Bill struck me before the recess as needing amendment, but I have mislaid my notes and must rely on what I can recollect. Section 23(2) would benefit from the insertion of a sentence along the following lines:</P>
    <P>In order to render the cost of regulation transparent to all users, such part of the levy as is imposed on an airport authority shall be an incremental and identified sum which shall be charged in addition to the airport charges and shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> This is a good idea in the interests of transparency and is also fairer to the airport operating authority. Transparency regarding charges is a useful principle for any legislation and I will deal with this further on Committee Stage and in talking privately with the Minister. This would be a useful amendment. The cost associated with economic regulation is a legitimate externally imposed expense over which the airport authority clearly has no control; all this does is to make the process visible.</P>
    <P>Section 33(4) uses the term &ldquo;may&rdquo;, stating that any determination in relation to any one of these airports may be made by reference to the aggregate of amounts, but the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be more appropriate. The term &ldquo;may&rdquo; clearly grants a discretionary power to the commission to treat the airports operating under the management of a single airport authority as an entity or as separate individual airports for the purpose of regulation of airport charges. This is a very important issue for the development of Cork and Shannon airports and for regional development generally. In this context, the discretionary power of &ldquo;may&rdquo; would be better in the definitive form of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is important that the three Irish airports are regulated as an entity. Anyone who has looked at the UK experience will see the enormous benefits that flowed from this system there and that could well be transposed into Irish law. This is required in terms of market stability and regional development policy. Cork and Shannon airports have, of necessity, smaller traffic volumes than Dublin. Regulating the three airports as a single unit will ensure that airport charges at Cork and Shannon are competitive compared to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>A particularly significant issue for smaller airports is that the relative scale of an expansion programme can be quite large in comparison to a larger airport, though in fairness and common sense, it is clear to everyone that by far the largest expense in infrastructural development in the short term will arise in Dublin. Clearly what I am suggesting would not be likely to have an impact in the short term, as I presume all of Dublin's profits will be taken up with the cost of dealing with infrastructure there. However, there will be a time in the future when it will be possible for a larger and more profitable Dublin Airport to subvent the other airports without undermining itself, ensuring a spread of traffic in the interests of the nation. Undoubtedly there will be people with other things to say about that here and in other fora. There were difficulties with this in the US and UK which were overcome by having the legislation more specific and by surviving court challenges. I am confident the same situation will obtain here if and when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Section 33(<i>d</i>) refers to &ldquo;the level of income of an airport authority from airport charges at the airport and other revenue earned by the authority&rdquo;, but I would include &ldquo;airport&rdquo; between &ldquo;other&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;. I am concerned that revenue earned by Aer Rianta from Great Southern Hotels, Aer Rianta International or other sources <Col N="842" /> we have not yet even thought of ought to be disbursed at the discretion of the authority as an incentive to innovation. I can see some merit in including it in the central fund under the regulator, but the effect of the UK legislation was twofold, effectively discouraging investment in infrastructure because of the pricing formula used. That formula militated strongly against the authority putting in the type of infrastructure it might have chosen had a different system been in place. Aer Rianta has displayed great competence and capacity for innovation and I would not like the regulatory regime to curb that in any way. This change would be beneficial in section 33, though I can see there would be a counter-argument that this profit, if it arose, should be included in this sense. However, the innovation inherent in Aer Rianta would be better encouraged by taking the route I suggest.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the interesting UK airport policy White Paper of 1985. They had huge difficulties devising a system of regulation because at the time there were effectively no precedents and they were in uncharted territory. The US experience which preceded it by ten years was quite different and not really in the area of regulation. They set out clear objectives, the first of which was to fulfil the Government's obligations under the Chicago convention and various bilateral agreements in operation at the time and to ensure that airport charges would be fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned airport charges originally I said that we attach perhaps too much significance to them. They get a lot more media coverage than they warrant and maybe that is inevitable because one or two of the players like to highlight them now and again&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to their own benefit, I suppose. Maybe private sector companies believe that is the way to operate and the way that profits them best but it would be very foolish of us to fall into the trap of going along entirely with that because there are other considerations that are just as central and as far-reaching in their effects.</P>
      <P>The Government also wanted to prevent airports abusing the monopoly power which they effectively enjoy. The BAA position was very similar to the current Aer Rianta one in that regard because it effectively controlled the large airports, including the London airports of any consequence and the four Scottish airports. It was very important that that be done and it is important that the same is done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulator was put in place to support the Government's policies for aviation. That may well turn out to be the most important role arising from this legislation. The UK considered leaving airport charges to the competition authority, for example, but it decided that it was such a specialised area that it was far more sensible to have somebody with the particular skills dealing with it. It is interesting that the appointee in <Col N="843" /> Ireland has American experience. It will be very beneficial and he will have an experience which he will bring to bear while obviously operating within the constraints of the legislation which will benefit Irish aviation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note as well that a country like New Zealand, which is in a different hemisphere and has had quite similar experiences to our own, has decided against using regulation. It would be useful to keep an eye on how things go there. It is also in a similar position in the sense that Melbourne and Sydney are relatively close and have the kind of unbalancing effect that, in many respects, the Manchester and London airports have on aviation in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the UK policy was the price cap fixing with sub-formula for some of the other airports. Distortions arose from that which were unhelpful and which I will mention in a moment. Only traffic charges were regulated but commercial revenues at airports were taken into account in the single till system, and that seems reasonable. It provided for a review every five years with the Civil Aviation Authority as the regulator. It is certainly worthwhile having a review mechanism and that will be important here.</P>
    <P>When the EU went into the area of deregulation, the expectation was that the outcome would be almost entirely similar to the US experience. The outcome was dramatically different in that some of the effects of deregulation in the US were not transferred to Europe, particularly in terms of the quick provision of low cost services from the existing carriers. The experience in Europe was that the low cost airlines entered the market around that time basing their formula on the US experience or those already in existence like Ryanair grew very dramatically and had, of course, a very large impact. However, the control of slots in airports such as Heathrow &ndash; Heathrow is not the only example and it is unfair to single out the UK because the same applies almost universally across mainland Europe &ndash; turned out to be much stronger, more far-reaching and more powerful than perhaps those in the business of liberalising the European market had anticipated. I think there have been three tranches of European liberalisation which have had a very substantial effect. The Irish Government was one of the first to enter into the spirit and the actuality of pursing that route along with the Dutch and the UK Governments.</P>
    <P>The result after 13 years of price regulation in the UK has been that landing charges at Heathrow and Gatwick have been reduced by 50% in real terms.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Dublin charges stand at about 70% of that which is an extraordinary phenomenon in the context of the changes that have taken place. It points to Aer Rianta's com<Col N="844" /> mitment in the area of pricing. Of course, it found it much more difficult to use the system of regulation to further Government policy objectives. It certainly found it difficult to use it to promote maximum competition between airlines mainly because, as I said, the airlines already had those slots and they were big European players &ndash; national airlines in most instances. I welcome this legislation and look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Like the majority of people who have contributed, I also welcome the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, as an important milestone in a hugely important Irish aviation industry. The Bill is important in that the regulator, when this Bill is given legislative effect, and the commission will regulate five key areas of airport business &ndash; airport and traffic control charges, ground handling service providers, the granting of operating licences to air carriers set up in this country, the administration of rules governing the allocation and take off of landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with airports the passenger throughput of which is in excess of one million passengers per annum &ndash; in other words, Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. Will the Minister clarify whether a regional airport, for example, which achieves a passenger throughput of one million will come within the jurisdiction of the regulator? Is one million passengers the benchmark? </P>
      <P>By the end of this year more than 14 million passengers will have passed through Dublin Airport. We have already spoken about conditions at Dublin Airport on the Order of Business. For many people passing through Dublin Airport, it is a harrowing experience. Many who pass through Dublin Airport would never do so again if they could help it because too many people have had to endure slow baggage delivery onto carousels and missing luggage has been the lot of too many passengers arriving here.</P>
      <P>What other airport would allow a situation where arriving passengers make their way to the pavement outside the arrivals door only to find there are no taxis and they are left languishing in long queues waiting for their turn to eventually come? It is simply intolerable &ndash; it is not fair that somebody having travelled half way around the world is left to queue, literally at a snail's pace, for the trickle of taxis that will eventually arrive. It gives a terrible first impression of this country and there is no excuse for it. As has been asked in the past, why has airport management not dealt with this long-standing problem? It knows, for example, the number of scheduled flights and the approximate number of anticipated passengers, yet a passenger, having travelled around the globe, arrives at the front door only to find that at the end of their journey, there is no taxi at Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> For arriving passengers, it is the queues at the carousel and for taxis and for departing passengers, it is the hazardous queues at the check-in. There are 16 newly located computerised Aer Lingus check-in desks at Dublin Airport. I was at the airport at 2 p.m. on Wednesday last and in spite of the long queues, many with elderly passengers, only five of the check-in desks were staffed. By 2.15 p.m. things had improved somewhat but the queue was now two and three deep and stretched from the check-in area almost to the front door of the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they Aer Lingus desks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Yes. As the Minister knows, the new desks have not been opened because of the dispute but I am talking about the existing set up where there are 16 computer terminals. Why should passengers be left queuing for so long? Why has a speedier, more efficient system not been put in place? What is the point in having 16 check-in desks if you do not provide 16 staff to man or staff them? It is bad enough to have to queue for a long period but because of the way the queues are organised or disorganised, there is a constant criss-cross flow of traffic, with passengers with trolleys laden with luggage trying to get from one location to another.</P>
      <P>An aspect of Dublin Airport which is of particular concern is the marked absence of adequate exits in the event of a fire or bomb scare and at a time when the most modest of community halls with their weekly bingo sessions are rightly being asked to comply with stringent fire regulation. One is struck by the fact that the only visible exit at Dublin Airport with thousands of people crowded in at any time and catering for, as has already been said, 14 million passengers per annum, apart from those waiting to greet or see off passengers, is one set of arrival doors. I accept that Dublin Airport is the victim of a failure of foresight and forward planning and is now playing the difficult game of catch-up. However, management and the airlines will have to get their act together. Customers and consumers &ndash; the travelling public &ndash; are entitled to the same level and quality of service they would get in any other capital city air terminal.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister on RTE's &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; two weeks ago when she faced questions on the chaos at Dublin Airport. There is much talk of the designation of the airport as co-ordinated. However, no definite improvement is visible or guaranteed, nor is a time scale forthcoming. Last week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> reported that the chairman of the Dublin Airport scheduling committee wrote to the Minister stating that a move to full co-ordinated status was unnecessary and would lead to a reduction in traffic using the airport. In her reply to Second Stage the Minister might comment on the content of the chairman's letter and whether he sought a meeting with her and/or her Department to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> This is a national political issue given that such a large segment of the population passes through Dublin Airport every year. Millions of Irish people travel through Dublin Airport every year as a result of the Celtic tiger, deregulation, competition and the welcome resultant cheap air fares. These passengers see at first hand how chaotic the airport is compared to other international airports and they will not accept such chaos any longer. Action and not talk is what is required.</P>
    <P>I will restate Fine Gael's policy on the privatisation of Aer Rianta. The two consultants' reports on the future of Aer Rianta made their conclusions on the narrow basis of the best interests of the company's balance sheet. Fine Gael believes that our three international State-owned airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork are as vital a part of our national infrastructure as the ports of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Cork or Rosslare, or the N5 or N11, yet there are no proposals to sell off our ports or roads. Why should we contemplate selling off such a vital component of our transport infrastructure? The key question has to be whether it is in the national interest or in the interest of consumers to sell off such an asset.</P>
    <P>In Britain and across Europe privatisation of state enterprises has worked well but the experience has been mixed in Ireland. The Eircom debacle speaks for itself, an issue to which I will return during the forthcoming Question Time. However, privatisation became badly unstuck in Britain when it extended to public utilities such as water and rail track. Dublin Airport is not only a public utility; it also has an undisputed monopoly. Aer Rianta's latest annual accounts indicated that the airport made a profit of £48 million making it one of the most profitable airports in the world, despite all the chaos. This figure was achieved before most of the Ryanair discounts were abolished on 1 January, thereby increasing landing charges from £4 to £8 per passenger. Dublin Airport services at least one third of the population every year. A public monopoly is bad enough but a private monopoly in such a vital sector is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Cork and Shannon Airports have been rightly referred to as very important entities in their own right and there is no logical argument for selling them jointly or separately. Both are three hours' drive from Dublin and service very different and viable catchment areas. Taking everything into consideration I am firmly of the belief that our three Aer Rianta airports should be retained as a single public entity. A £48 million profit is clear evidence that Dublin Airport is literally a licence to print money. Why should that profit and resource and all that public money be handed over to a private individual or consortium? Surely the facility and its great potential should be retained, properly developed and managed for the benefit of the tax paying public.</P>
    <P>The public policy context has been forgotten in the debate on the best future and strategic options and direction for Aer Rianta. There are two key <Col N="847" /> policy issues. First, national air access for an island economy such as ours and, second, regional policy. The success and continued growth of tourism depends on competition and high quality, frequent, air services. If the Government owns the airport it can decide to retain a policy of low landing charges and aggressively market new routes to promote and sustain overall national economic benefits for tourism and commerce. However, this is not possible where such a vital asset is handed over and owned by private shareholders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen spoke about the possibility of Dublin Airport assisting the enterprises, welfare and development of Cork and Shannon Airports. I hold a similar view. I wish to see the profits from Dublin Airport being used to benefit Cork and Shannon. Shannon Airport has been the linchpin on which the regional development of the south west has been built. Such regional considerations would not figure in the thinking of private shareholders if the airport was handed over to a private individual.</P>
    <P>Those who argue for the IPO to meet the capital needs of Aer Rianta continue to advance the argument that the State cannot invest in our airports. No one has shown me where the EU stipulates that a state cannot invest in airport development. We have a conventional public capital programme which invests in different forms of infrastructure without difficulty or stricture. I am concerned that Cork and Shannon Airports would be left on the hind tit as regards investment by a restructured Aer Rianta in a post-privatisation environment.</P>
    <P>One must question one of the basic assumptions in the consultants' report which states &ldquo;It is our understanding that direct Exchequer financial support to Aer Rianta is not a funding option&rdquo;. I do not believe it is contrary to EU or other rules to make such state investment in airports. The availability of State capital for the core development needs of Shannon, Cork and Dublin is not a problem for the Exchequer in the prevailing, positive economic climate. However, Fine Gael believes the arguments of the national interest in respect of Aer Rianta's role in Dublin, Shannon and Cork do not apply to Aer Rianta International. We have a definite view on the retention and State-ownership of Aer Rianta nationally but we have no objection to Aer Rianta International being wholly or partly privatised and the proceeds being used to fund domestic core business.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Bill is on the State-owned airports but it does not address the crucial issue of regional airports in the regional and national economic contexts. Regional airports have a dimension in terms of the regional and national economies. Despite much initial scepticism about the future or success of regional airports they have defied the critics. They work on very tight budgets and many have shown commendable resourcefulness. I am particularly concerned about the welfare and future of Knock airport. <Col N="848" /> The airport was built to international standards, has a 7,000 ft. runway and an excellent terminal building. It could not be better located on the intersection of two national primary routes &ndash; the N5 and N17.</P>
    <P>Knock Airport is 20 years old. The view was that it would provide the economic fulcrum for the development of the region but, unfortunately, it has failed to realise its potential. From the point of view of the development of tourism, the airport is not getting the tourists in. From the point of view of providing a cheap service for the thousands of emigrants from the west there is something wrong when it costs £300 to fly from Knock Airport to Britain and one can fly to San Francisco for £25 less. I do not want to be critical of the management because they are doing their best. However, there is a limit to what this management can achieve. There is an urgent need for an injection of further management and management skills into the airport. I commend the management for taking the airport through its embryonic and developing stages to its current stage of development. However, an airport of this size and potential with six or seven flights a week cannot survive in a modern competitive environment.</P>
    <P>That is why I urge the Minister, when there is currently huge expectation in relation to the airport which is not being met, where a substantial amount of taxpayers' money has been invested in this resource, where ongoing marketing grants are being given to the airport, to look objectively at Knock Airport to see what can be done to improve the quality of service. The Minister has given approval to the public service dimension, but something will have to be done as there is huge public concern. Monsignor Horan's dream was that this would be the people's airport. It is not, because it is not delivering a quality service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates indicated that he would bring forward various amendments on Committee Stage. I will mention two because I will bring them forward now in my own name.</P>
    <P>The first relates to air safety standards. The Irish Airline Pilots Association has on more than one occasion expressed concern about the smoking regulations on airliners. Currently, under Statutory Instrument 62 of 1986, carriers must take all reasonable steps to prohibit smoking. However, smoking is not an offence. It should be. The strongest possible penalties, financial or custodial, should be handed down. Imperilling the safety of 300 people on an airbus or 50 on a commuter plane is much too serious an issue. We have been given graphic details of what has happened on occasion. People have gone into the toilet, removed the anti-smoking device, thrown the cigarette into waste paper, and at times cabin crews have had to fight fires in mid air. The consequences of this are quite obvious. We will be tabling an amendment to make it an offence to smoke when signs are illuminated. In addition we are proposing a financial and/or prison penalty.</P>
    <P>The other amendment relates to the question of disruptive behaviour, which has arisen on <Col N="849" /> many occasions and is unfortunately becoming increasingly frequent, with obvious consequences for passengers and also from the point of view of the huge costs incurred by having to divert because somebody has taken too much drink or just decides to be disruptive on a plane. Staff have been assaulted, even sexually assaulted, on planes. We have to get tough in relation to these two aspects. I will bring forward Committee Stage amendments in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Daly. I would like also to welcome Deputy Higgins to his new responsibility on the Front Bench.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill to provide for a commission for aviation regulation. I thank the people in the Irish Aviation Authority who have served us well, and I wish them the best of luck in the future.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the independent regulation of airport charges, including charges for terminal services provided by the Irish Aviation Authority. The legislation also provides that the commission will assume responsibility for a number of other aviation functions which are currently the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are five policy areas with which the new commission will be dealing: the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in the European Union; the designation, where necessary, of Irish airports as co-ordinated airports under the relevant EU regulations; approval of ground handling services provided at airports; and the licensing and bonding of tour operators and travel agents.</P>
      <P>The issue of airport charges has attracted much publicity, very much driven by the airlines. While a reduction in airport charges would be very welcome, one of the main reasons Air Rianta could offer discounted rates was the steady stream of revenue from duty free sales. This is no longer available, although Air Rianta announced that it would roll on until the end of 1999 and give a further six months of discounted rates for the airlines. Obviously airport charges are necessary. The increase in business, particularly at Dublin Airport, has ensured that airlines generally are doing very well here. The Minister's proposal in this area will put this on a stronger and surer footing, now that the independent commission is being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the view that smaller airports should be allowed to benefit from the success of Dublin <Col N="850" /> Airport. The tourism industry has gone from strength to strength. However, given that airports can be nervous places and the terms in which I have heard Dublin Airport spoken about, we should be careful to get our facts right lest we put people off flying.</P>
    <P>Other State airports would like to see more development, which might improve the regional balance of tourism and transport throughout the country. The points made about infrastructure should be looked at in relation to all airports. I fully support the developments at Shannon. However, the charter business, both at Shannon and Dublin, is often developed at the expense of other parts of the country. I note that charter flights that come to Shannon use a traditional route &ndash; people visit the mid-west and come to Galway City, and that is as far north as they go. My constituency, East Galway, does not benefit, nor do counties Mayo and Sligo and the north-west. This should be looked at. The same is true in regard to charter flights to Dublin. Most charter operators say it is difficult to get to parts of the west where people want to go because the infrastructure does not exist. In considering this matter, we should remember that development is needed on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>The issue of car parking also needs to be considered. We are pushing people further and further away from the terminal at Dublin Airport through the opening of long-term car parks. This does not happen at other airports. Shannon Airport, for example, has much better car parking facilities. People must bring their cars to airports because there are not enough taxis or buses.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see new business at Shannon Airport. Recently when I visited Shannon Airport I noticed there were flights from Shannon to Amman, Jordan. Royal Jordanian Airlines were using that as a base also. That is welcome because new business at Shannon is needed. There is more potential for development at Shannon than there is at Dublin Airport. I have heard Dublin Deputies talking about the need for a second airport in Dublin. I will not get into that debate but obviously we must look to the future and see how that issue will be dealt with. Certainly there are some important issues there regarding car parking and the points Deputy Higgins made about queuing up for tickets at the new desks.</P>
    <P>Airlines pride themselves on being the system which gets people from A to B in the shortest time and I have been disappointed, particularly during the holiday period, with my experience in this regard. I have received many complaints from my constituents who when they check into an airport two hours before departure as they are told, find that they are then left sitting on a stationary aeroplane for up to two hours. It is bad enough that sometimes people must wait around for delayed aeroplanes in airports perhaps overnight, but it is very difficult, particularly for families with young children, to have to sit waiting on aeroplanes for long periods. There should be an explanation for such delays. Perhaps the pro<Col N="851" /> vision of slots for takeoff and landing, to which the Minister referred and of which I have heard her speak previously, would go some way towards solving this difficult problem. I suppose it is worse to have to sit on an aeroplane on a runway on Gran Canaria, where it is very warm, rather than on one in Dublin but it is not a pleasant experience in either case. Many people have told me about such incidents. I wonder are airlines just chancing their arm when they state they have a slot, when they know well that the aeroplane in question will be delayed at a resort such as Gran Canaria. These kinds of situations should be addressed and I hope they will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned the cost of flights from the western region. It is difficult to understand how flights can be so expensive from places like Knock and Galway to European destinations compared to the price of flights from Shannon to the United States, for example. Obviously in some cases in flying from Shannon to Europe one may need to take two flights but the difference in the prices of flights from, for example, Knock to Great Britain and from Shannon Airport to the United States is amazing.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk about the location of Knock Airport, but the people got one thing right when they built the airport. They certainly provided a fine runway. Christy Moore even wrote a song about it. In Galway, we may not quite have done things properly because I understand the airport board is still trying to obtain a compulsory purchase order to acquire the remaining lands needed for the runway. The board is very pleased the Minister gave it a marketing grant of £125,000 for this year and it is keen to get increased funding for marketing. However, there is an issue which Galway must sort out for itself, that is, whether it will develop the airport or move to a new location at Oranmore. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, has come out strongly in favour of a new development. If the bigger aeroplanes cannot land in Galway, we will not develop the county's tourism and industry. We need to get that support. I welcome the marketing support grant but the board and the chamber of commerce must ensure that they make the right decision in the future regarding where Galway Airport will develop.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's new commission will be successful in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this imaginative Bill which will play an important role in the development of our airports. I take this opportunity to welcome the new general manager at Shannon, Mr. Bob Goldfield, who will take up his duties in a few weeks and to express my appreciation for the work that was done by Mr. Barry O'Shea and the people involved in managing development of Shannon over the years. The transformation which has <Col N="852" /> taken place at Shannon in recent years has been miraculous. A few years ago nobody could have anticipated the huge expansion in business and travel which was to take place at the airport. There is a great debt of gratitude due to people such as Mr. O'Shea who have been to the forefront in planning and managing the airport. I certainly wish Mr. Goldfield success in his new venture. He has broad experience, not only in the European aviation business but in the international business. I think he will be welcomed to Shannon and I am sure his influence there will continue the expansion and development of the business at Shannon which is thriving as never before.</P>
      <P>To some extent this expansion and development is due to the economic upturn which has taken place, but it is also due to our sound aviation policy in recent years and that the Minister has paid special attention to Shannon, although I will not go into the detail of the huge investment which has taken place in the airport.</P>
      <P>There has also been huge investment in the Irish Aviation Authority. That authority, which goes relatively unnoticed, has done major work already. It has expanded its operation, it is earning large revenues for the State and it is providing useful employment. It has almost completed its new office accommodation at Shannon and it is certainly providing opportunities in the aviation business which were undreamt of years ago. It is now in competition for other aviation business throughout Europe. This is a welcome development which must be supported.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new commission is timely. The Minister said she will not step back from the operation of that. One of our fears is that the commission would not be as sensitive as the Minister to the needs in the regions and that for this reason there may be a type of Civil Service approach to dealing with the issues rather than one which takes account of the political dimension of issues like the importance of regional airports. For that reason, while we welcome the new commission and wish it well with its work, we hope the Minister will continue to have an influence and if there are some matters not totally in keeping with what was set out as the Minister's intention, there may be ways in which this could be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of revenue from duty free sales can be remedied. I am somewhat disappointed that, even though it was anticipated that there would be losses arising from the curtailment of duty free sales, it has not been possible to rearrange the sales operations in airports to make up those shortfalls. It is time there was a review of the sales and shopping businesses at airports generally and perhaps a new agency would be put in place which would develop that kind of business because there is an amount of shopping done at every regional and international airport. There are areas outside the European zone where duty free arrangements are still in place. It should be possible for Aer Rianta to make up the short<Col N="853" /> comings arising from the initial fall off. I do not know why it has stopped selling cigarettes and liquor. It baffles me that there are people who will buy cigarettes and liquor whether duty free or non-duty free. When it was clear to Aer Rianta that there would be difficulties in this area it should have had the imagination to take some initiatives in the shopping area. Every business, including the smallest business, has had to readjust its operations to meet competition from the big supermarkets and so on. We now have thriving small businesses running side by side with huge supermarkets. I see no reason Aer Rianta should lose revenue in its shops, sales and catering and in business generally. It should accelerate and develop those areas.</P>
    <P>There has been some anxiety about the catering operations but perhaps this can be dealt with on Committee Stage. I am not sure whether the regulator will have any influence on such matters. Nevertheless these are important issues as jobs are at stake. It would be detrimental to the overall economic development if the business opportunities associated with the airline business in flights, sales and catering and all the extra business were to go abroad because we failed to tackle these areas and deal with them effectively.</P>
    <P>I shall have an opportunity at the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to deal with this matter in more detail. I avail of this opportunity to welcome the new commission and wish it well in its endeavours. I encourage it to press ahead with the development we have seen during recent years and to be optimistic about the future. The development of international, local and regional airports is vital given that business and international travel will expand. I see no signs of a recession or a downturn that would affect them to any great extent. We want to open up new opportunities, develop new businesses, establish new jobs and, above all, give the direction to an authority which will ensure that those passing through our airports get to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible. This Bill will be a major step in that direction and I wish the Minister well in getting it though the Houses.</P>

That an independent regulatory commission is being provided for can have many advantages. Given that the question of privatisation of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus are very much on the agenda it will be difficult for the Minister to tackle the problem of privatisation of these companies. In the interests of the development of air transport to this country it is important that the companies know exactly where the Minister with responsibility stands. If Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and every other regional <Col N="854" /> management team know where we are going and are aware of the Minister's intentions it is a worthwhile exercise. I hope the Minister will indicate, once and for all, clearly and unequivocally her position and that of the Government in regard to privatisation of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I welcome also the fact that the commission will have responsibility for other areas heretofore within the Minister's brief. A question which occupies my mind coming from the west is that if we hand over those responsibilities, will the commission have the power of decision to make or to create investment in airports? I am thinking particularly of a situation with which the Minister is familiar in County Galway. It has been said that Galway city is the fastest growing city in Europe. It has had phenomenal industrial growth over the years. Most of the companies are American, some indigenous and some others are foreign companies. That industrial growth came about because of the input of successive Governments, the IDA and all other agencies with responsibility for development of industry. Tourism also has grown enormously and has been the lifeline for sustained livelihoods in the west. This may not have happened were it not for the growth in industry. We want this to continue but it necessitates a clear indication from the Minister in respect of the development of air transport in Galway.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what money is put in, Galway Regional Airport at Carnmore simply cannot develop successfully as a quality airport with sustained growth, sustained development and in a way adequate to provide services to a fast-growing city. We now have an alternative in that State lands in the possession of the Department of Defence are available and also approximately 90 acres of adjoining land are available from Galway Corporation. Galway Corporation has positively indicated that those lands would be made available for the development of proper airport facilities for Galway city, County Galway, east Galway and the west.</P>
      <P>Other people want to see the development of other regional airports. None of the airports is similar to that in Galway. Access is second to none. All the primary routes converge beside the site. It is in the unique position where it can be served by a rail line to the perimeter of the site. That is a unique opportunity that could be developed. If growth is to be sustained in industry and in tourism in Galway, along the Atlantic seaboard, in the west and in east Galway, it is necessary that a decision be made quickly.</P>

I hate to say, but Deputy Kitt said it earlier, we have one Minister of State who says we must have it and have it quickly, and I agree with him. Another Minister in west Galway says we have to support Carnmore at all costs. Obviously there are divisions and different interests in this.

      <P>The board naturally wants to continue where it is. It established that airport and the Government provided approximately £4 million support for it last year.

Before any further moneys are invested, a decision must be made on whether to move. The opportunity is now available and the Minister must take responsibility for making that decision.</P>

      <P>Hopefully, we can, as public representatives, encourage it to do that and to avoid a situation where, as it now appears, there is division at the highest political level. I hope the Minister can impress upon her colleagues that where we are going should be clarified once and for all. I believe it is important not only for the west but for every part of the county that the airport at Galway city be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this legislation is charges. The issue of airport charges and costs is hugely important. The commission will have new powers delegated to it regarding the operation of licences and co-ordinating the approval of ground handling service providers at airports. Look at some of the industrial problems there have been at our airports over recent years and at the major controversial disasters related to air traffic, travel operators and the bonding of travel operators. It <Col N="856" /> is welcome that there will be an independent view of these as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There were disasters in the recent past with regard to travel agents. It is now possible for airlines to sell tickets on the Internet. Is there any way of regulating that? This country is lucky in that it generally has responsible travel agencies which operate well on behalf of both passengers and commercial interests in negotiating fares with the airlines. Where will this modern technology fit in with regard to regulation? Many people will be aware that one can go on the Internet and book a ticket without the hassle of going through agencies and in the case of certain airlines it can be much cheaper. That is an advantage for many. However, will there be some degree of regulation of privately booking tickets for travel through that medium under the Bill? Huge numbers are employed in the travel agency business in this country, many of them in vibrant travel agencies in small towns. This new facility will encroach on them and will obviously result in a decrease in their volume of work.</P>
    <P>Handling agents in airports is another important issue. At present, if a handling agent is unhappy with the conditions in the airport, health or safety issues or general working conditions, the agent can withdraw from the airport and bring it to a halt. There should be some mechanism or back up service to prevent this occurring in future. As we have seen in the past, a lightning strike can stop all movement of passengers through the airport.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister clearly indicating her support for the development of a new airport in Galway at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister the best of luck with the new commission for the regulation of aviation. It will be achieved by amalgamating Aer Rianta with the Irish Aviation Authority. The Minister's approach to transport problems in general is forward looking and constructive and I wish her the best of luck in her endeavours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Bill were more comprehensive and covered aviation throughout the country and not just at the three main airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon. I wish it were all embracing. We need a national aviation policy and it is about time we had co-ordination. We do not have it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find Dublin Airport disorganised and somewhat itsy bitsy. If one is leaving the country for one or two weeks, one is obliged to leave one's car in the long-term car park. If one is unlucky, it can take a long time to get back to the main terminal. That is not a satisfactory arrangement. People have talked about running the Luas to Dublin Airport. That is an excellent idea and the sooner it is done, the better. However, there should also be an internal railway system within the airport, as is the case in London, Paris and <Col N="857" /> other continental airports. That would be useful for bringing people from the car parking areas to the various terminals which have now spread out in all directions. There is a necessity for a grandiose plan but I see none at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that £350 million will have been spent by the end of 2000 but we need to think bigger and in a more organised way. The present system of slapping on a wing here and there and putting a car park further out on the M50 is not the way to do it. I would like to see a plan which would lead to something co-ordinated, organised and workable and get rid of the massive queues at the various departure points in Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful that liberalisation, to use the Minister's term, was introduced in the aviation industry about ten years ago. It led to a growth of air traffic which resulted in the tourism boom this country is enjoying. It was an important element in the development of the Celtic tiger. That is not recognised and the people who were responsible for it were never given proper credit. Long may it continue. There has been a huge annual growth rate since 1994 at the rate of 12.5%. The fact that people have cheap access in and out of the country is worth billions of pounds to the economy each year. I do not know if this has been quantified but the monopolistic situation of Aer Lingus up to that period was a positive drawback to the tourism industry and I am pleased this has been recognised by all sectors.</P>
    <P>I recall when Opposition spokesman on transport in 1980 having several meetings with the chief executive of Aer Lingus. He was adamant that the lowest possible return fare between London and Dublin and <i>vice versa</i> was £208. Now such a return fare is only £60 or £70. In real terms, £208 in 1980 would now convert to closer to £1,000 if Aer Lingus still had a monopoly. The advent of liberalisation or deregulation has worked wonders for this country. I would like the Minister to extend this further and let the privatisation of Aer Lingus go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not let those who are screaming about recent difficulties shout her down. The same applies to Aer Rianta. I do not understand why this should not be privatised. I am aware the Minister is setting up a new body but she should privatise the company and give people value for money. That is what politicians are elected to do. By introducing regulations to govern these bodies if privatised the Minister is doing her job properly. She is doing a fine job as things stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be hamstrung by procedures introduced in the 1920s and 1930s when these services were needed, whether in CIE, the ESB, Aer Lingus or whatever. That day has passed and we are now in a period of open competition and giving people value for money. The stark statistic I cited about Aer Lingus in 1980 proves how the <Col N="858" /> Irish public were ripped off for years because of incompetence and empire-builders within the public service. These people should not have been allowed to get away with it. I was reprimanded within my party and criticised by the other parties in the Dáil for saying so at the time. I am pleased this idea has come to pass and I would like to see it extended.</P>
    <P>I would like an end to the cosy cartels which operate within monopoly companies such as Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus because these companies should be made to compete. The Aer Lingus pilots who are currently threatening industrial action would be much better off if they were working in a private capacity because they would probably earn twice as much. However, while they are employed by a straitjacket monopoly they will never attain that level of pay.</P>
    <P>I will now move to the south side of the city and a point I have raised repeatedly on Question Time. Why have positive measures not been taken to open up Baldonnel as a civil airport? This has been spoken about for years and I have been raising the question for at least ten years. It is a very logical measure to take because the infrastructure is in place and the land is available if needed for longer runways. This would be ideal and help to eliminate much of the traffic chaos in the greater Dublin area. All the traffic heading for Dublin Airport on the Naas dual carriageway could go to Baldonnel. People living in the general area of west Dublin could use Baldonnel. All major cities in the western world have at least two commercial airports. Dublin, with its traffic chaos, needs two airports more than any other city.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate in her reply if she has any positive proposals to open up Baldonnel as a commercial airport? I am aware she must consult the Ministers for Finance and Defence and the Cabinet. Why is something not being done to alleviate the chronic traffic problems in Dublin which could be solved to some degree by providing a second airport on the western side of the city? This would facilitate people living in the south of the country and in the west of Dublin and would alleviate much of the traffic chaos on the M50 and on the roads in that general area. Why can this decision not be made? I presume it is because the Air Corps and the Department of Defence are objecting, that the mandarins in these areas wish to hold on to what they have. That is the usual occurrence within the Civil Service. However, this problem should be overcome and I ask the Minister to make a decision on the issue.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Minister should have a national plan not just for the three major airports referred to in the Bill but incorporating the regional airports. This is an island nation and we need easy access. We need to be able to get in and out of the island easily. Some fine airports have been built throughout the country but they are not being properly supported. We have gone so far but we have not gone the full way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> A terrible tragedy occurred last year in Tramore, County Waterford. If Waterford Airport had had the type of equipment which any airport should have, that tragedy would not have occurred. That is pinpointed in the report of the inquiry into the tragedy. If the navigational aids had been in place and qualified air traffic controllers had been on duty 24 hours a day, there would not have been a tragedy.</P>
    <P>All these airports, Waterford, Farranfore, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Castlefin, need to be upgraded. Given that the market exists, we are three quarters of the way towards doing the job properly. Why not provide the money for longer runways and better navigational aids to allow these airports to cater for regular passenger planes which could carry 200 to 300 people? Will the Minister not go the extra few miles in relation to airport runways in these regional airports? This needs to be done. Aer Lingus has pulled out of most of these airports because it cannot land planes which are big enough. The flying public exists and Aer Lingus would use these airports if they had sufficient capacity. Ryanair would use the airports if the equipment was in place and the runways were sufficiently long for planes to land. The charter business is becoming huge, not to mention the executive jets. All of them need a proper infrastructure but it is not being provided. I plead with the Minister to finance regional airports and to introduce a Bill which incorporates not just three airports but also the other five or six airports which I have mentioned to make them viable entities. Management at regional airports scrimp and scrape and send delegations to the Minister begging for a few hundred thousand or a few million pounds more. Let us have a comprehensive aviation policy.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the compulsory stopover at Shannon has done wonders for the tourism industry. Some colleagues from Limerick and Clare may not agree but it has worked a treat. I meet Americans today who visited Ireland years ago and they are delighted they can fly in and out of Dublin. They did not visit Ireland half as much previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourist traffic has increased enormously as a result of direct flights in and out of Dublin. It was a progressive move and the Minister should not allow vested interests and lobby groups to dictate to her and prevent her from doing what she knows is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get very annoyed when I read vitriolic comments about Ryanair. The company has done more than any other group to boost the tourism industry through its competitive price structure and the manner in which it brings people in and out of Ireland. It is vilified almost daily instead of being given the praise and credit it is due. If <Col N="860" /> Ryanair has a technical difficulty with an aircraft or a difficulty with staff it becomes an issue on national radio and television. It is as if the pro-monopoly lobby would like to see Ryanair destroyed or ruined or at least bad-mouthed. Ryanair has done wonders for the tourism industry and long may it continue. I wish we went the whole hog and privatised Aer Lingus as well as Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Ryanair has a difficulty with Aer Rianta's airport charges and is constantly complaining. The company feels it is being victimised and it has threatened on occasion to stop using Ireland as its base. Those who watch Sky News will know that Ryanair sponsors the weather forecast. Its network is spread throughout Europe and it probably could do without Ireland. The Minister should bear in mind that it would not be the first time a great industry or operation was moved out of Ireland because of petty jealousy, red tape or bad people in State bodies squeezing them out and she should not allow that to happen. The Minister is doing a fine job. She should stand up to the begrudgers and assist the people who are helping this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish to refer to the issue of regional airports. I regret that the regional airports with the most potential could not have been accommodated within this legislation, which deals with airports with a throughput of more than one million passengers annually. Nevertheless, regional airports such as Kerry and Galway Airports have a great deal of untapped potential. The Minister referred to her policy on such airports. The appointment of a regulator and a commission is welcome.</P>
      <P>I travel frequently and when one examines the standards of airports in Europe and America in comparison to Ireland, one sees a difference. Heathrow and Charles De Gaulle Airports have been improved considerably over the past ten years and the number of American airports which have been improved to a high standard brings home how far Irish airports must go despite recent improvements.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport has experienced considerable growth in the past five years and it is a profitable enterprise. Restaurant and catering facilities were needed there but those which were provided recently leave a great deal to be desired. They remind me more of what one would find in eastern Europe rather than in America or western Europe. The new restaurants are badly designed and do nothing for a modern airport. I passed through the airport recently and made that comment to a number of people. A great deal of space was used but it was not used positively or to its maximum potential. Internal and external space is as important at airports as it is anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of baggage is critical with people flying into Dublin Airport from many other airports. They have deadlines to meet or appointments to make and I have seen many people in a <Col N="861" /> frenzy because their baggage has not arrived. This could even happen in the case of a flight from a regional airport such as Kerry Airport. I have witnessed many international commuters in a frenzy because they have missed appointments, their schedule has been affected or their return trips have been delayed. Improvements have been made but the importance of the transfer of baggage cannot be emphasised enough.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy in regard to the increase in tourist numbers. The advent of the new philosophy of deregulation and liberalisation has made Ireland more competitive in terms of attracting other airlines. However, I disagree with the Deputy in regard to Shannon Airport. I could be accused of being parochial but the tourism industry has been affected in Kerry and the west. Tourist numbers may have increased, which is good for the economy, but Clare and Kerry's market share has been affected.</P>
    <P>It did not affect the performance of the Minister's party at the last election in Clare, where it won three seats, despite two Members resigning during the Shannon stopover dispute.The Minister's party played it very well in Clare but when the compulsory Shannon stop-over was abandoned it must have affected the economy of the area, including tourism in the mid-west and to some extent the location of industry there. The end of the stop-over is a reality now and will not be reversed but it should be taken into consideration when we are developing regional policy. Perhaps we can compensate that region for the loss of market share in tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a credible regional policy we must strengthen our regional airports. I wish to refer to Kerry Airport in particular. Yesterday I tabled a question on the Adjournment about the concern in Kerry because of rumours and statements emanating from Aer Lingus during the summer period that the company may not tender for the PSO to operate the Dublin-Kerry route after next January. The Minister graciously received a deputation from Kerry led by the chairman of Kerry County Council and the members of the deputation were impressed by her honesty on that occasion. Because of that deputation more pressure was put on Aer Lingus by the people in charge of Kerry Airport. I was delighted that yesterday, at noon, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was probably under some pressure, announced that Aer Lingus was going to tender for the route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>But a tender is only one part of it. It is an open competitive process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but the first thing was to get Aer Lingus to tender. That was the important thing we were concerned about. After that, of course, it is an open process. We believe that, according to the specification on the European Commission's statement, Aer Lingus would be the only operator that will meet that require<Col N="862" /> ment. As far as I can see, it will be difficult for our other indigenous operators to reach the standards set out in the specification. For that reason I am hopeful that Aer Lingus will continue to operate that route. Aer Lingus has a high standard. Whenever one travels abroad one can feel that standard and experience it. When one compares Aer Lingus to other carriers it certainly has very high standards of comfort and passenger care that other airlines just do not have. That must be recognised.</P>
      <P>It would affect the schedule of services on the Kerry-Dublin route if Aer Lingus was not operating it and that feeling is shared by the general population in Kerry. When rumours and statements were emanating from Aer Lingus that the company was reviewing its entire internal operation, there was a major campaign within the county. It was one of the most unified campaigns I have ever seen within Kerry. Unfortunately, if we had led a similar campaign when we were seeking Objective One designation it might have been more effective.</P>

      <P>That will come in the future, no doubt. Tralee, Killarney and Listowel Urban District Councils, Kerry County Council, the chambers of commerce in Tralee and Killarney and the Kerry branch of the hotels federation all came together with a concerted campaign. We have certainly convinced the Minister, not that she needed to be convinced. Now that we have gone some of the way towards that objective, Aer Lingus will also fully appreciate the importance of its service to Kerry and how much we appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the summer Aer Lingus carried out a review of its internal operations. As a result of that review the Kerry-Dublin route has been identified as one with a commercial basis &ndash; in other words, it can be profitable. I understand that last year Aer Lingus lost money on that particular service. If one looks at the company's overheads, however, that is understandable given that its overnight accommodation costs are in excess of £250,000. The crews remain in Kerry for <Col N="863" /> such a short time overnight that I am sure the accommodation bill could be substantially reduced. If that matter and the other overheads were examined I think the company could make the route profitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has specified that standards must be improved and she has obtained approval from the European Commission. At times people do not understand how these things are done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for saying so. It is 50% extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now specifying that there will be three daily flights, seven days a week. The minimum seating capacity is being increased by 50% to 300 seats. Those are major improvements. As a result of this, Aer Lingus can use its initiative and connections to ensure that the service will be successful. The company will market the route and use its connections abroad to market Kerry Airport internationally. The business must be there. This year some two million tourists visited Kerry. Approximately 78,000 came<i> via</i> Aer Lingus flights and many of those are local commuters. There must be major potential for the Kerry-Dublin route if it was properly marketed. I am sure Aer Lingus will take the route seriously and will be able to make it profitable.</P>
      <P>Kerry is representative of all the counties along the western seaboard and it suffers from peripherality. In general, the county's access roads are very poor and we have no port facilities. In addition, our train facilities leave much to be desired because the Mallow-Tralee line is inferior. There has been some investment in it recently but, generally, time is lost on that stretch of track. It takes five hours to get from Kerry to Dublin by car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a similar journey by train, but it is a long drive. We are suffering because of our peripherality in terms of attracting foreign industrialists and a bigger share of the tourism market. We want to push the county from an industrial viewpoint. People are very mobile now and they do not want to waste time on roads here or elsewhere. Their time is short and they require good travel facilities. Unless regional airports, such as the one in Kerry, have that type of daily access we will have more disparity concerning mobile investment. I know from my efforts in America that it is difficult to get industrialists into Tralee, Listowel or Killarney. While industrialists may not be that concerned about cargo movements, travel times for personnel are critical factors. Such people will not waste valuable time travelling by road or on a very uncertain rail service; therefore, one must have air access.</P>

    <P>Aer Rianta owns the main airports and thus has a major advantage. Farranfore in Kerry finds <Col N="864" /> it hard to compete with Cork and Limerick because they are better financed by Aer Rianta and can provide better facilities. The only way that can be compensated is through Government investment in regional airports given the regional disparity that exists. This is why regional airports must become an instrument of regional policy. The only way they can compete is through investment and there is a commitment in the national plan regarding regional airports. In the case of Kerry Airport, the Minister has started positively, given her recent announcement, and the facilities there must be improved. The airport has one of the finest runways in the country but there is a need for better handling, lounge and reception facilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate which gives us an opportunity to discuss air travel in this country. The Bill must be welcomed because it is important to establish a regulator and a commission. It provides an opportunity to address the regional issue and the Minister will hear much more from now on about the importance of regional airports. People have suddenly woken up to the fact that time is important to people who matter, such as investors and managers. They will not spend time travelling on roads, irrespective of the sentiment or cajoling involved in trying to get them to locate in a county. This is why the Minister will hear much more about the importance of regional airports.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille. I note from reading the transcript of the Seanad debate and from watching this debate on the monitor earlier that the purpose of the Bill is to establish a commission to deal with aviation regulation. However, it is a useful opportunity to consider wider aspects of aviation policy which are continually changing. It is important to debate these matters. I make this point as a Deputy for Dublin North but they are also important in terms of the country's overall welfare. These issues need to be constantly debated.</P>
      <P>The commission will regulate charges for Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority. Over the years, these bodies have managed to keep themselves separate. They have developed very well, but they created a considerable amount of frustration for me and others when we tried to clarify areas of responsibility in relation to ground handling. The unions and workers are concerned about reduced levels of safety in this area. This is a serious matter which needs to be clarified in terms of ensuring the highest safety standards are maintained in the context of deregulation and all the other pressures that will arise from our membership of the European Union and general free trade conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which needs to be clarified is what is the best body to monitor noise. The greatest awareness of many of my constituents of Dublin Airport, including those who work there, is the constant issue of noise. When they ask who monitors the noise from Dublin Airport &ndash; I am <Col N="865" /> sure this also relates to other airports &ndash; they are told that Aer Rianta generally monitors it on the ground and the Irish Aviation Authority monitors it in the air. This creates a huge amount of doubt about whether the job is being done properly because one body tends to pass the buck to the other.</P>
    <P>These matters need to be clarified before any other changes are introduced. Competition is fine and consumers and the Minister will be aware of its effects in all areas. However, we must take a step back in terms of corners that are being cut with regard to safety. We must consider whether the bottom line is cost or if safety should be factored in to compensate in areas where competition will not address safety issues.</P>
    <P>I hope the debate will give rise to a wider discussion on the Government's spatial planning policy and aviation policy. At present, there is the prospect of huge decentralisation to areas around Dublin, despite all the policy documents. There is congestion on land and also in the air. There is the strange situation that noise pollution is not even monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency. Aircraft noise is excluded from its remit. This is bizarre and we tried to change it when the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was going through the House. However, for some reason, the move was resisted.</P>
    <P>The local council carries out some monitoring but it is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and it has no legal obligation to do so. The knock-on effect of growth in air traffic must be taken into account. In my area of Dublin North, the demand for runways is the major issue and it will cause a headache for the Minister in the future. Many people who live in St. Margaret's community and Portmarnock work in Dublin Airport but they say there must come a time when the growth in airport traffic is capped in a region of a certain size. A policy of continued increase in traffic is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport has earned an excellent reputation over many years, but I detect a change. Deputy Higgins spoke about the difficulties of overcrowding and the pressure on the infrastructure there. The Government may say this problem has been caused by success &ndash; the Taoiseach is wont to say that whenever these problems are mentioned. However, end of year profits are not the only measure of success. In some ways they can cloud the bigger picture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates earlier made alarming comments about the possible effects of smoking on aeroplanes and the need for more regulation in that area. These issues must be taken on board in addition to the end of year balance sheets. Representatives of all parties at a recent meeting in Portmarnock said that Baldonnel should be developed. This is a change, it used to be a case of no place other than Dublin Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the problem has been shifted a couple of miles south. The lack of adequate rapid transit has been repeatedly mentioned to the Minister. The results of that are to be seen around Dublin Airport. There is now a semi-permanent traffic jam. I travel via the airport regularly and, as the Minister knows, I cycle as often as possible. However, the road surface around there is so bad that I had to buy a mountain bike to enable me withstand the difficulties it presents. The infrastructure around the airport is crumbling. When I try to avoid causing a traffic jam by cycling, I am penalised by the bad road conditions.</P>
      <P>Passenger numbers point towards the need for some type of radical aviation policy which foresees a cap in the future. At present we are talking about 14 million passenger movements at Dublin Airport. The recent aeronautic convention in Enterprise Ireland in Glasnevin projected that there would be 40 million passenger movements in 2020. I do not know how the current infrastructure will deal with that. We need 20:20 vision. Rising fuel costs will also have an effect. We need realistic planning to avoid a boom and bust scenario where business goes on as usual until something interrupts it.</P>
      <P>It is frighteningly irresponsible to expect never-ending and accelerating passenger levels when many factors will impinge on that projection, such as space around the airport, fuel availability and cost, air traffic safety, the effects on residents in the area of expansion, for instance in Portmarnock which is within the 35 noise nuisance index zone and is looking at another runway proposal near the town, and environmental stress, which is an international issue and must be taken into account. Unless the Government takes responsibility for this issue we will be on a collision course &ndash; I hope it will not be the same type of collision course as the <i>St. Phelim</i>&ndash;  in terms of the economic problems which will arise if we do not plan for the future.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport currently has three operating runways. Some 78% of the traffic uses runway 1028, which runs from St. Margaret's to south Portmarnock. That is the main cause of noise for people living in that area. Runway 1129 is smaller and it runs parallel to runway 1028, while runway 1634, which is also small and runs towards Santry, has been closed down. I understand Gatwick Airport operates on one runway for 20 million passengers. There are five airports in London and only one in Dublin, yet that is the busiest route. The five airports from London are feeding into one little funnel. Aviation policy must take that into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plans for a new runway over central Portmarnock give considerable cause for concern not <Col N="867" /> just about noise but about safety, separation zones, the possible doubling of the noise nuisance index and the added problems of aeroplanes circulating in the area and burning off fuel or, in the case of airbuses, jettisoning fuel over the Irish Sea. We must look beyond the end of year returns which look rosy, airport curtilage and the welfare of the current population to see what will be left for future generations. It is time to factor in the costs as well as the benefits in terms of health, ozone depletion, greenhouse gases and noise.</P>
    <P>We must try to strike a balance in this debate. Notwithstanding what Deputy Deenihan said about the need to get football fans to Dublin in double quick time, there is a big question mark over when it is as competitive to fly as it is to take a train. Fuel consumption for rail travel is less than that for air travel, yet people weigh up which they will choose. There is something wrong economically when people do that. We must look beyond the scenario of business as usual, whether it is private or public. I suggest that if it is public and it is not broken, there is no need to fix it. We must bring the wider issues into this debate. The development of lighter air travel in the 1930s, such as the airship, was abandoned because of the Hindenburg fire. However, developments in technology and in airship travel means that if this country is serious about its future and factors over which it has no control, whether it is the Gulf War or matters relating to OPEC countries, it needs to have contingency plans for air travel and to work at making them a reality. It must be our priority to make those plans into the future. If we spearhead developments in airship travel in the same way as the Danes have become world leaders in wind energy, a considerable amount of our needs would be met. We, as an island nation, are being handed something on a plate which other countries have abandoned. The time has come to look again at this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, mentioned an issue in which the Minister knows I am interested, namely, the crash of the <i>St. Phelim</i> in 1968. We should look more closely at this issue, particularly if we are talking about regulation and safety. I know an investigation was carried out and I thank the Minister for instigating that. However, the more I hear about dives and exploration of the <i>Titanic</i> at many thousand feet, the more I realise we should not have a problem exploring the remains of that aeroplane to see if conclusions can be reached so that such a tragedy is not repeated. History tends to repeat itself if the causes are not closely examined. I hope we will take the initiative and look more closely at the <i>St. Phelim</i> because that type of disaster hangs like a cloud over everyone involved in the aviation business, particularly the pilots, many of whom I know. I hope the Minister responds to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and looks more closely at this issue.</P>

It will also deal with the granting of operating licences to air carriers, the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. I understand the Bill will affect airports with more than one million passengers. Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports will fall into that category.

      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins, who is spokesperson on public enterprise and tourism, set out graphically the major problems in Dublin Airport. I agree with what he said because I have received many complaints from the users of the airport about its inefficiency and how they have faced chaos on a regular basis. I cannot understand how check-in desks can be left unused at peak times while passengers have to queue almost outside the doors of the airport. I know that may be a matter for the airlines but it adds to the airport's inefficiency. That type of attitude shows contempt for the public and a high level of complacency among the people operating the airport.</P>
      <P>There has been an ongoing public debate about whether our main airport should be sold off to private enterprise. Although Dublin Airport enjoys a monopoly, it is still a vital national asset. It would be unacceptable to sell it off to a private company. Cork and Shannon airports are also vital national assets and must be retained in public ownership. It would be unthinkable for anybody to suggest that we sell off our ports and harbours and it would be equally unthinkable to sell off our main airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 34, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have remained in close contact with the British Prime Minister and the parties in Northern Ireland over the summer months. I met Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, on 5 July, 27 July and again on 16 September last. The issues under discussion included the implementation of the Patten report, demilitarisation and the increased incidence of intimidation and attacks across Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I had a useful meeting with First Minister, David Trimble, on 28 July last. Our discussion spanned a range of issues including the planned plenary meetings in the autumn of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.</P>
      <P>On 31 July I met with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in Downing Street, and again on 8 September in New York. I also had a number of 'phone calls with him. We discussed a number of issues including the threat posed by dissident republican groups, loyalist violence, the Policing Bill and the overall political situation in Northern Ireland. We will continue to stay closely in touch in the period ahead. I had raised the Pat Finucane case on a number of occasions with the Prime Minister and had requested him to meet with Geraldine Finucane and the Finucane family. That meeting took place last month.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Blair and I issued a joint statement on the second anniversary of the Omagh bombing. We expressed our deepest sympathies to the families of the bereaved and the injured. We also emphasised our continued commitment and determination to bring to justice the perpetrators of this awful atrocity.</P>
      <P>I met President Clinton on 8 September last in New York, accompanied by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. I took the opportunity to brief the President on recent events in Northern Ireland, including the implementation of the Patten report. We also discussed the possibility of a further visit to Ireland by the President later this year. I hope that the President can come before his term of office is over and I certainly made clear that he would be most welcome. Nothing definite, however, has been arranged as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Tánaiste and I had the pleasure of welcoming David Trimble and Séamus Mallon and the other Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive to Dublin Castle for the second plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. The message from the council was extremely positive and an ambitious agenda of work was decided on for the period ahead. We reviewed the 13 meetings of the council in sectoral format that have taken place and the significant progress made in establishing and developing the work of the Implementation Bod<Col N="875" /> ies. This represents an unprecedented level of co-operation on this island. We look forward to making significant substantive progress in the various sectoral councils in the coming months. In addition, work is well advanced on setting up a new all-island tourism company. It is clear that all of us, North and South, stand to benefit from this kind of co-ordinated approach on such practical matters.</P>
    <P>The council agreed procedures for recruiting the chief executives of a number of Implementation Bodies and approved the terms and conditions associated with these appointments as well as conditions of service for staff generally employed by the Implementation Bodies. The council also agreed specific proposals in regard to grading, staffing, numbers and remuneration in the Trade and Business Development Body.</P>
    <P>The council agreed an initial opinion on the budgets for the Implementation Bodies for the period 2001 to 2003. The North-South Ministerial council envisages that the total to be spent by the six bodies next year will be IR£64 million or £48 million sterling. The proposal is that the southern contribution should be IR£49 million, or £37 million sterling, with IR£15 million, or £11 million sterling from the North. This reflects the continuing development of the work of the bodies which are now expected to employ 900 staff in total during the course of 2001. The details of the budget proposals will be considered further as part of the processes for planning public spending North and South. Final estimates for the bodies will be submitted to the NSMC in October-November, following approval by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive Committee.</P>
    <P>The council agreed to initiate a study on an Independent North-South Consultative Forum, appointed by the two Administrations, as recommended for consideration in the Good Friday Agreement. The council agreed that a working group of officials from both Administrations and the joint secretariat would be established to take forward the study and report to the next plenary meeting.</P>
    <P>The agenda for Government published by the Northern Ireland Executive Committee on 29 June 2000 identified actions to support North-South development, including the need to take action to remove barriers to living and working in the North or South. In this context the Government agreed to co-operate with the Northern Ireland Executive Committee in taking forward a study, through a steering group of officials, North and South, on the obstacles to mobility between the two parts of the island. This steering group will report to the council and the costs of the study will be shared equally between the two Administrations.</P>
    <P>The council had a useful exchange of views on an Irish Government paper on enhancing competitiveness of the two economies on the island, North and South. It agreed that it would be valuable if further consideration could be given to the <Col N="876" /> matter by the North-South Council in its trade and business development format at its next meeting on 27 October with a view to reporting to the plenary.</P>
    <P>After the council meeting, I met the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble. We discussed a range of issues, including the outcome of the South Antrim by-election, the loyalist feud, the threat posed by dissident republicans and the implementation of the recommendations of the Patten report. We agreed that there were challenges to be faced but that these were by no means insurmountable. The Government will continue to work in a balanced way to foster and sustain confidence on all sides and to overcome the obstacles so that we can progress the real, practical agenda for change that is central to the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Further to the commitment given in the Good Friday Agreement to take active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island, the Government has provided support, under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, for a number of projects reflective of the different traditions. In regard to strands other than the purely Nationalist strand, these included the Journey of Reconciliation and Trust Peace Park at Messines and projects promoted by the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association, the Ulster Society and the Federation for Ulster Local Studies. In addition, last year the Government announced an eightfold increase in the funding available to the Reconciliation Fund administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs to £2 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The Government announced last December that it had agreed to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne. The development of the site will serve to mark in a fitting way the significance of this important historical event for all the people of Ireland, in particular for the Unionist tradition. The interdepartmental committee with responsibility for developing the site, whose membership includes an official representative of the Orange Order, has initiated a process of extensive consultation, including with representatives of the Unionist tradition, the relevant local authorities and community groups. In addition, a programme of interim measures involving road widening and signage was put in place at the site during the summer months.</P>
    <P>The Government, in line with our commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, will continue to take active steps to demonstrate our respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there are a number of Deputies who have devoted a great part of their lives over the past ten years &ndash; in Deputy Currie's case for over 30 years &ndash; to bringing the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions into being? Does he agree that most such Members are deeply worried about the present situation and the rigidity of positions being adopted? Does the Taoiseach agree that if, for whatever reason, justified or otherwise, David <Col N="877" /> Trimble is overturned as leader of the UIster Unionist Party, the Executive and the institutions associated with it could no longer function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that an enormous number of people have worked extremely hard over many years to put together what has been achieved in the past few years. I am concerned with day to day developments which centre around three or four areas, but in dealing with these the positives far outweigh the negatives. There are hundreds of people alive today in the North who would not be if the work mentioned by Deputy Bruton had not been sustained, particularly in the past few years. The Northern economy is much stronger and there has been increased investment in a wide range of areas. All this would not have occurred without the leadership of David Trimble. I was particularly taken with the remarks of Sir Reg Empey last week when he said that the more people talked the Ulster Unionist party down, the more the party would go down.</P>
      <P>We must focus on the implementation of the Agreement and reinforcing the positive benefits that have been achieved. The Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council are working well and doing real business. The 13 sectoral meetings have dealt with substantive issues. Individually they may not be earth-shattering issues, but collectively there has been an enormous amount of co-operation right across the implementation bodies.</P>
      <P>People are getting a real sense of ownership of the institutions that have been established. The announcement of the membership of the civic forum will help in this regard. Deputy Quinn has been highlighting this at Question Time and it has been endeavouring to get up and running for some time. I acknowledge that it has taken a long time, but it is now up and running. Ultimately, if the system of governance works and is seen to work, we can achieve the long-term peace and stability that we all want and the quality of people's lives will have improved dramatically. As First Minister, David Trimble has a mandate from the people to implement the Agreement. The by-election was a disappointment to him, but it does not change the result of the referendum. The people of this island voted overwhelmingly for the Agreement and I know Deputy Bruton would want me to continue to work with David Trimble and all the pro-Agreement parties to ensure all aspects of the Agreement are implemented. As well as getting the structures right, we are progressing all other aspects of the Agreement, including demilitarisation, decommissioning, policing and reviewing the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made over the summer months. I do not deny that there continues to be pressure &ndash; that was particularly so over the summer. The violence in loyalist areas is disturbing, as is the threat posed by dissidents. We will do everything we can to progress the real <Col N="878" /> agenda for change that is necessary. I take Deputy Bruton's point. Regardless of whatever differences, interpretations or analysis people give, it is far more important to resolve them. An amount of issues have been resolved and people have strong views on the difficult matters that are left. I understand that, but we should try to square the circle and sign off on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that he and other Nationalist leaders have done enough to win over the support of Unionist doubters for the Agreement? Specifically, what is his view of the comments made by SDLP Councillor Declan O'Loan to the effect that the reason for the potential collapse of the Agreement is the widespread disillusionment among Unionists with it and that this disillusionment puts particular responsibility on the Nationalist community and its political representatives? Does he agree that the major problem is the name of the police service and that Nationalists, including the Taoiseach, others in this House, ourselves and the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, need, as Declan O'Loan put it, to attend to why this is a genuine and significant issue for Unionist people and to deal as best we can with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody here is doing their utmost to be accommodating and I think that is acknowledged by the leadership of the Unionist Party throughout. In regard to any issue they raise with the Irish Government, we genuinely &ndash; and it is appreciated &ndash; try to help in the resolution of it. In relation to the representative of the SDLP&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Declan O'Loan who is a member of the Ballymena Urban Authority representing the Social Democratic and Labour Party and a Nationalist has said he believes Nationalist leaders should be doing more to win over Unionist support for the Agreement at this critical time given that if David Trimble falls, the Agreement falls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree because it is what I am doing, needless to say. Also, I think I would be misleading the House if I did not say that the leadership of the SDLP, both the party political leadership and the leadership in the Assembly, would state very strongly what their views are on the outstanding issues. They have stated their position very clearly on a range of issues that are still outstanding, so I have to take that as being the position of the SDLP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, it is in the interest of everybody on this island that the leadership of the Executive through David Trimble and Séamus Mallon and the pro-Agreement parties continue to be able to move their work programme on through the Executive, the Assembly, the North-South structures and the British-Irish Council. Anything that would upset that would be bad news. I do not subscribe to the view that <Col N="879" /> the dissidents, as David Trimble calls them, within his party are in any way right in portraying the failures of the Agreement. Of course, they see that any concessions that are made are not beneficial to their side, and I can understand that. I spent hours and days on end listening to that point of view put forward by both Unionists and loyalists, but particularly Unionists, so I understand their point of view. However, Sir Reg Empey's remarks on the other side also have to be reflected on. We do not face the death, the mayhem of the past. The economic issues, social development and investment are doing better. I understand the effect of the loyalist violence, particularly during the summer. That has been signalled by group after group and deputation after deputation as a fact that there is still violence. Of course, to an extent, the continuing threat by the Real IRA is continually menacing from that organisation.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on his remarks last week when he said that Sinn Féin would have to resolve its relationship with the IRA before his party would enter Government with it? Will he define what he means by the word &ldquo;resolve&rdquo;? Does he mean prior decommissioning? Is he looking for the IRA to be disbanded or is he looking for a declaration that the war is over?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have got the third statement on several occasions but, ultimately, whenever it is possible, and the sooner the better as far as I am concerned, I would agree with the view put forward by Martin McGuinness, the Minister for Education in the Northern Ireland Executive representing Sinn Féin and a former chief negotiator for Sinn Féin in all these matters, that he would hope the IRA would disband, fold up and be gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, prior to that happy event, if the Taoiseach would use his undoubted influence with both Sinn Féin and the IRA to recognise the difficulties in which the Unionist community finds itself, that is, the lack of substantial progress on the overall issue of decommissioning and the sense that many people in the Unionist community have in regard to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement for which they voted, perhaps reluctantly, on assurances from the British Prime Minister and others that a substantial change would take place but who feel that that substantial change has not taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that a significant compromise has been made in relation to the issue of decommissioning? Against that background of compromise on one side, does the Taoiseach think that he and the British Prime Minister can use their undoubted influence to persuade some flexibility in the interpretation of the Agreement and its related components to ensure that the Agreement with all of its insti<Col N="880" /> tutions continues to survive because nobody is talking down the strength of the position of the Unionist Party other than themselves in terms of the way in which they voted and behaved? </P>
    <P>The Agreement does not belong to Sinn Féin, the republican movement or the Unionist Party, it belongs to all of the people of this island. The Taoiseach indicated earlier the amount of taxpayers' money that is being committed on behalf of the people of the South of Ireland to that process. What specific steps does the Taoiseach intend to take to restore sufficient trust in the process to enable the Agreement to continue against the background of the forthcoming British general election?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the arms and decommissioning end of it, the Agreement that was satisfactorily worked out to allow the Executive to be reinstated back in May and June makes provision for arms dumps inspections which would reinforce confidence in the process and I hope the next round of that will happen as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To Sinn Féin. The Deputy mentioned my undoubted influence on the IRA. I am not too sure I can ever claim to have exerted any influence on that particular organisation but I hope I did on Sinn Féin. I have emphasised very strongly that Maarti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa are heading up that inspection and moving on on the check back of the June inspections and even further inspections is something I would welcome. I think that would certainly be helpful.</P>
      <P>My officials are again today at one of the numerous meetings in London or here trying to resolve the other outstanding issues. There are not many issues now but they are very important to both communities and not easily resolved. They are not holding anything up but they feed into a lack of confidence. On the issue of dissidents, we are continuing to put enormous resources into trying our utmost to control and to eliminate that threat but, as with all of these things, that is not easy. The Garda does all it possibly can as do the other police services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot do much about the other issue which is feeding into this. Loyalist violence is extremely destructive and we do not understand too well how that feeds into the process in the North. I suppose it has been best put to me by many of the delegations. If somewhere between 200 and 300 houses in a relatively small area of this city or any other part of the Republic had to be vacated during the summer, we would know how we would feel about it. I pay tribute to the resilience of the people of the Shankill and offer my sym<Col N="881" /> pathy to them in regard to the terrible violence they have endured.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the political leaders of loyalism have used their political skills very effectively over the last number of years, and that has been appreciated by everybody here, to achieve a political and a peaceful co-existence with their neighbours. The present dispute is doing damage to their cause and to the cause of all who want lasting peace. I hope that the efforts that are being made to find a solution are successful and I urge all those involved to redouble their efforts. There is not much we can do on that other than to lend our support to those efforts being made.</P>

      <P>I also tabled a question to the Taoiseach. Recognising that policing is a core issue that must be resolved, does the Taoiseach share my concern at the statement by David Trimble reported yesterday in which he calls for a rowing back of the British Government policing legislation due before the House of Lords later this month? Does the Taoiseach agree that the Patten report and its recommendations are a compromise based on a broad view of the policing issue and is not a programme of concessions to Nationalists? Does he also agree that the current British legislation on policing does not implement the Patten report in full and that we need to see the full implementation in legislation and a new, non-sectarian police service <i>in situ</i> in the North of Ireland? Does the Taoiseach further agree that this issue is bigger than the political fortunes of any one political leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated my views on the Patten report many times in interviews and inside and outside this House. I have always said that the full implementation of the approach set out in the Patten report proposals offers the best opportunity for the new beginning for policing in Northern Ireland which everyone wants. That is our shared concern and we have a shared objective to achieve a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole. Only then will it be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise how vitally important it is to achieve this objective and how important it is to the Agreement as a whole. Issues remain to be resolved and people know what those issues are. It is unfortunate but not surprising that some of those issues have gone on for so long, but they still have to be resolved. Any of the issues, whether previous issues or issues which delayed <Col N="882" /> matters, always have to be resolved. I have not ever seen a major issue go away &ndash; someone, some day has to resolve it. The issues of the Patten report, its implementation and the drafting of legislation are to be resolved. I do not believe anyone will move completely in one way or the other. That means we have to try to find an honourable agreement. Mr. David Trimble sometimes says things which are not palatable to some people and other people say things which are certainly not palatable to him. Those of us in the middle trying to find resolutions have to continue to do so. I assure the House that we will continue to ensure that the new dispensation and beginning are achieved because that is the only way we will successfully resolve this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We all wish to see tensions eased on the basis of parity of esteem. Following reports of a security crackdown on paramilitary dissidents, will the Taoiseach take into account concerns which have been strongly expressed to me that the level of British military activity in south Armagh in particular is increasing tensions? This is particularly the case where cattle movements, BSE and TB issues are interlinked with British military personnel entering farmland and fences being damaged and not repaired. Will the Taoiseach take this into account in discussions with the northern leaders such as the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, or with the British Prime Minister to ensure that whatever is done to alleviate tension is done within the bounds of necessary security and that nothing is done to heighten tension which would be counter-productive in terms of security by driving people who are unhappy with the <i>status quo</i> into the arms of those who wish to wreck the process? Have any measures been taken to make that point to the British authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Deputy have been made to me several times. The Deputy will forgive me if I say it sounds like the agenda of the South Armagh Farmers Association which has a legitimate case which it put to me many times. I have represented those issues and we have pushed and moved towards trying to get as much normalisation and demilitarisation as possible in south Armagh. There has been some movement of some of the permanent structures in that area.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, residents would say there is more security in parts of the area in peace time than was the case in troubled times. There is also the concern that some of the difficulties with dissidents still emanate from that location. All of these issues have to be taken into account in trying to deal with the situation. I take the point and have made the point many times that heavy security in that area has not resolved the problem. However, in fairness to the British Prime Minister, it is very difficult for him to totally ignore the intelligence concerning this area but I have pursued the issue long and hard with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Minister Mr. Martin McGuinness is correct in saying that the outstanding issues of policing and decommissioning are bigger than the political fate of any one individual? However, does he also agree that the reality is that if that one individual &ndash; David Trimble &ndash; is overthrown there is no Executive and that, under the Agreement, Mr. Martin McGuinness ceases to be Minister for Education and Mr. Séamus Mallon ceases to be Deputy First Minister? That is the way the Agreement has been framed. Unless there is sufficient support for the Executive within unionism and nationalism there is no Executive.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about the fate of one individual out of some sort of sympathetic concern for that person. We are talking about whether, through David Trimble, unionism is willing to support the continuance of the Agreement. We in this House as Nationalists have a great historic responsibility at this stage in history to ensure we are not looking back two months from now and saying, &ldquo;If only we had said this&rdquo;, &ldquo;If only such a concession might have been made the Executive might still be in being&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It isn't in being and it's all the Unionists fault&rdquo; but still there were these things we might have been able to do to save the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it would be no consolation for us, for this House or for the next generation of Irish people if, three months from now, we are able to blame the Unionists yet again but we have no Executive or cross-Border bodies and ten, 15 or 20 years' work is gone down the drain? Would he therefore agree it is very important that all Nationalists &ndash; whether from Fine Gael, Sinn <Col N="884" /> Féin, Fianna Fáil or the SDLP &ndash; bend every political sinew and every element of their imagination to ensure the Unionist community recognises that this Agreement is also for them, that it is worthwhile, that it is delivering for everyone who lives in Ireland, whether Unionist or Nationalist? Would he agree that David Trimble should be given by Séamus Mallon, Gerry Adams, Bertie Ahern, Ruairí Quinn and by everybody else, the political help that he needs if he is to survive, that this is a moment of decision for us as Nationalists in this House and that we do not want to look back on this as yet another well intended effort into which huge amounts of time was put but which was lost because of an issue of nomenclature, or timing or some comparatively unimportant issue in the overall scheme of things?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the issue of whether this is bigger than one person. The Good Friday Agreement is supported by the people and by the pro-Agreement parties. For that reason it must be implemented. Whether it is First Minister, Deputy First Minister, or whatever, we do not want to row back and undo things. As I have already said, and as Deputy Bruton has said now, compromises must be made. It is normally impossible in any walk of life to get away from the emotion people feel about some aspects of this. If one person is totally on one side of an argument and another person is totally on the other side, it is rare &ndash; we see it every day in this House &ndash; that there will be a straight victory unless there is a straight vote. Normally in debate, for example, on Committee Stage, people listen to the other point of view, bring in amendments and re-examine matters on Report Stage. It is that kind of detail in which we are involved. I have made it clear on the biggest issue, the Patten report, that there must be a balance in going forward, that there must be an acceptable police service in the North that will serve everybody fairly, so that the problems and difficulties of the past can be left behind. That is what we must achieve. The titles &ndash; the Executive, First Minister, Deputy First Minister &ndash; are important titles. The Assembly, the institutions we have set up, the whole administrative system about which I have given details today, are co-operating and working to make life better for everyone. They are dealing with bread and butter issues which are important. That is all going well. What we are saying in this House is that we must try to find agreement in the last few areas. It must be remembered that about three months into the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement there were 181 items to be considered and I recall people asking me if I seriously thought we would ever get agreement on all of them. I said we would try. Now there are four or five items on the list. It does not, therefore, seem unreasonable &ndash; and I support what Deputy Bruton said &ndash; to ask people to stretch themselves that little bit and try to find a resolution that will allow all of the positive things <Col N="885" /> to continue. I do not want a situation where Unionists feel depressed, where Sinn Féin or the SDLP, or the DUP for that matter, feel depressed. I want them all to feel that they can share in a project that is worthwhile, meaningful and positive for the area in which they live, and for us to have a good relationship with them as we agreed in voting for the Good Friday Agreement. It should not be beyond the bounds of the English language, or of the Irish language for that matter, to work out such compromises.</P>

I base this on precedent, on history. The Executive will inevitably fail if that happens. Therefore, to use Deputy Bruton's words, every sinew should be exerted to get agreement on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of his statement about the conditions and circumstances in which Sinn Féin would be involved in Government, with which I entirely agree, does the Taoiseach think it would be useful to have a joint declaration between the four <Col N="886" /> leaders of the parties that might be involved in the formation of the next Government on the circumstances and conditions under which they would have any dealings with Sinn Féin, emphasising the democratic process and the fact that there is only one Army in this State?</P>

        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach aware that the experience of working-class communities in Northern Ireland is one of continued sectarian division, including sectarian attacks, and continuing polarisation which can lead eventually even to cantonisation on a sectarian basis, and, within the Protestant community, the added difficulty of intracommunity tensions inflicted by a small group of people on a majority of innocent Protestant people? Would the Taoiseach agree that unfortunately the Good Friday structures have not changed for the better in a major way the quality of life of the majority of working-class people? Would he agree that if political leaders continue to posture on a sectarian basis, playing to sectarian galleries, they will continue to be agents of division, when what is needed is a mass movement at the base to unite communities and begin to fundamentally change the lives of people for the better?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the establishment of the interim parliamentary tier, the next meeting will take place in Galway. The two Parliaments have made the changes necessary to bring in our colleagues from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We will probably be in a position to establish it at the next meeting which is to take place shortly and at which we will probably have everybody except, unfortunately, our colleagues from the North. I hope they will join when those changes they have always argued for have been made. I would like the position to be otherwise, but we will keep pursuing that.</P>
      <P>On the issue of young Nationalists, the Deputy has a point. However, I have been told by the SDLP and Sinn Féin that if a resolution is found to areas of difference, they will recommend that young Nationalists and republicans should join the police force. That will not be the position of either party if those resolutions are not arrived at. Regardless of what we say here, we would be wrong to think that the feeling in Nationalist and republican communities is other than extremely strong. That is part of the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sectarian attacks, notwithstanding what I have already said about the Shankill, this summer was a marked improvement on previous ones. There were very few areas where the parades gave rise to other issues, but there are still problems. Looking at the figures, attacks are predominantly against Nationalists. In fairness to Nationalists in the North, when the problems were in the loyalist areas the Nationalists did things which they have not done in 30 years to try to assist and alleviate the movement of people and traffic. Therefore, this year in the areas which have always been afflicted the Nationalist people <Col N="887" /> who have always suffered certainly tried their utmost, particularly in the second half of August and in September, to allay those fears, but of course the level of attacks in the Shankill area by loyalists has been enormous. What has happened in that area is horrendous. It may be better that I do not go into any more detail on that &ndash; I think people are aware of it &ndash; but it really has been horrendous.</P>
    <P>On the level of freedom of movement of people, maybe we should not forget the excellent festivals which took place in the North this summer which enjoyed massive attendances from all over this island with little or no trouble. There probably would have been more trouble if they had taken place in parts of this city. Therefore, we should look at all those issues in a positive way. Our difficulties still come down to finding a resolution to Patten and to the difficulties of both the Shankill Road situation and the militant elements of the Real IRA and some other fringe groups.</P>

      <P>I have already made clear my wish to support the Board of the National Theatre in its plans to create an Abbey Theatre which can look with confidence to affirming its role at the heart of theatrical development in Ireland as the theatre approaches the centenary of its foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has submitted proposals to me regarding the development of the National Thea<Col N="888" /> tre, that is the Abbey and Peacock Theatres, and I met with its representatives on site to discuss the issues. I have received advice from the Arts Council and the Office of Public Works. I am currently evaluating their advice and will then embark on a process of consultation with my Cabinet colleagues with a view to obtaining a Government decision as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I noted when this was announced during the summer that she mentioned she would discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance with a view to providing funding. The Estimates are coming up shortly and there will be a budget in December. This is an important project. It is, after all, the National Theatre. Has the Minister had any indication of the Minister for Finance's response or has she approached him yet? Will there be any method of obtaining funding for this development under any EU programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the history and the current state of the building and of the different reports which have been asked of the Abbey Theatre regarding its situation. In 1994 an architectural review of the buildings was commissioned but unfortunately nothing happened as a result of that review.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, I took the opportunity of discussing this on more than one occasion with those who are involved in this project in the Abbey Theatre. I think all of us in this House would immediately say that the conditions in the Abbey Theatre leave a lot to be desired. We are talking about a national theatre. We know and can all be proud of the work that is done there. What we want are facilities to match the particular high quality of performances which can be seen there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my discussions, a number of options have been put forward to deal with this matter. One is the option which I would term the &ldquo;do little&rdquo; option, in other words, tinker around at the edges with the existing building. Another option is to remain on site and undertake extensive work on the site. The third option would be to consider a greenfield site. Some of these options must be considered. I wish to give some idea of the costs which would be involved in this. The first option should not be considered. We cannot deal with this matter by just tinkering around at the edges. We need a radical approach to this and, therefore, that leaves the other two options, to move to a greenfield site or remain on the existing site. If it were to be on the existing site, the amount of money about which we would be talking would be about £50 million. If we were to go to a greenfield site, we would be talking about £60 million to £65 million, but those within the Abbey Theatre are discussing these issues at present to find the best way forward as between options two and three. There are many who would like the Abbey Theatre to remain on the <Col N="889" /> present site for historical reasons. That kind of continuity could be important to many but this matter is being reviewed by those in the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>We must look at this in a radical way in terms of finance. To answer the Deputy's question regarding the moneys which will be available, she is perfectly correct in saying that these moneys are not available in my Vote as it stands and, therefore, I will have to look to my ministerial colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, for assistance on this. As I have said, I intend to put forward all these proposals to my Cabinet colleagues without further delay and I hope to receive support for this project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that there will be 100% funding from the State, whether the amount will be £50 million, £60 million or £65 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously something which must be discussed. Very often the approach adopted is not simply one of Government funding, but there are other approaches to fundraising etc. which have been adopted on other projects throughout the country. We must first establish the principle and the path we wish to take. Then a Government decision will be made, particularly involving the Minister for Finance, on the amount of moneys which will be made available. I have spoken to the Minister but we will be going into more detail on the bilateral issues. We will have an opportunity to discuss this with him and to give him more of the facts and figures on this issue. First we must establish the principle. Then we can see how those moneys can be attained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a timeframe in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Abbey Theatre has put forward a strong case for many facets of its argument. It is continuing to look at the options and it wishes to come back to me on that before any final decision is made, but I have said that I wish to see a radical approach to this and not simply one which tries to tinker with it. All of us recognise that the Abbey Theatre needs extensive work and I am sure all of us would wish to see that done.</P>

      <P>As a matter of courtesy, my Department sent a copy of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, to the European Commission for infor<Col N="890" /> mation. I am not aware of any issues of dispute with the Commission relating to the Bill. It is my understanding that the Commission does not generally comment on member states' draft legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the EU Commissioner for competition policy, Mario Monti, is to bring forward proposals which would restrict the income which state-sponsored broadcasters receive from advertising to 20%? Does she agree, against the background where 50% of the income of RTE in 1999 came from advertising, that this clashes seriously with the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, and that if these proposals are passed into law, the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is a nonsense in so far as the future of RTE as a digital broadcaster is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering what the Deputy was trying to get at. He refers to the introduction of digital television and the European Commission. I have already explained that the European Commission is not in the habit of commenting on draft legislation. The reference in his supplementary makes the position a little clearer. He referred to the debate taking place in the Commission in regard to public service broadcasting. That is an area about which I share the Deputy's concern. It is important in areas such as public service broadcasting that these issues should be defined within the member state itself. Obviously public service broadcasting will mean something different to us than to other European countries. Discussions are taking place but I understand that no decision has been taken. There are indications that certain views are held within the Commission along the lines outlined by the Deputy. I share the Deputy's concerns. I have availed of the opportunity at EU meetings to outline the Irish stance which is that we are very much in favour of public service broadcasting. Any discussions taking place need to be reviewed extremely carefully to take into account our national interest and public service broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly has the Minister done to prevent proposals emanating that could be so devastating to RTE? What effective action has she taken up to now and what urgent action will she take to ensure our national broadcaster becomes viable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions that do not pertain to the question but may pertain to a later question on the Order Paper. To reiterate, RTE plays an important role in broadcasting in Ireland. Public service broadcasting is extremely important in respect of our identity and culture. It also looks after minority interests which might not necessarily be taken on board by any commercial concerns. The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, outlines the importance of restating public service broadcast<Col N="891" /> ing particularly in an era of tremendous change and challenge in terms of many other channels coming on line. The consumer will have more choice and may not want the channels that are repetitive and purely commercial but may want to view quality programmes produced by RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating categorically that a newspaper report which appeared recently indicating that the Commission was not happy with the position being awarded to RTE within the structure of introducing digital terrestrial broadcasting had caused some conflict with the Commission? In effect the Commission was unhappy with the legislation in that it gave RTE too strong a position. Is the Minister stating categorically that there is absolutely no truth in that?</P>

      <P>Efforts have been ongoing for a number of years to increase the availability of our broadcasting services in the North by upping the power northwards from RTE transmitters to Clernmont Carn in County Louth. After much discussion and negotiation between Irish and British officials and broadcasters the power of the transmitters was late last year increased to a stage where RTE estimate that reception of television services based on this side of the Border has increased to at least 70% of the population of Northern Ireland from roughly 30% which was the level when the current efforts to secure clear<Col N="892" /> ance for the increased coverage began. Final political clearance for the increased power is necessary but I am hopeful that this can be secured without undue difficulty.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the introduction of digital broadcasting techniques will provide opportunities for complete coverage of the North with our broadcasting services. The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, will, when enacted, provide that I shall have the power to direct that a digital multiplex or part thereof be reserved for terrestrial broadcasting services provided in Northern Ireland. The intention is that this power will be used if the British authorities introduce reciprocal arrangements for the carriage in Northern Ireland of broadcasters established on this side of the Border.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 102 of 1 February 2000, the suggestion by the Deputy regarding the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge transmitters in Northern Ireland is not under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am happy that some efforts have been made to improve transmission of TG4 to Northern Ireland via the terrestrial transmission network, is the Minister satisfied that this will enable every householder in Northern Ireland to avail of this service? No matter how much this transmission has increased the power I do not think it would penetrate to every area of Northern Ireland. Is it not in the interest of the Minister and TG4 that other transmission systems be considered such as the cable services? We were all disappointed that TG4 was omitted from the NTL agreement during the summer. Indeed, the Minister of State expressed disappointment at the time. Will the Minister pursue that area of transmission to ensure that everyone in Northern Ireland who has an interest in obtaining TG4 can do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been ongoing for about 20 years. At the end of last year we moved forward to a stage where reception of television services has increased to 70% as opposed to 30%. Obviously we wish to see a far greater percentage, if not the whole of Northern Ireland, being able to access RTE if that is their wish. There will be an opportunity to improve access with digital technology. There is a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, reached in the multi-party negotiations on the North, that in the context of the measures in relation to the Irish language that the British Government will &ldquo;explore urgently with the relevant British authorities in co-operation with Irish broadcasting authorities the scope for achieving more widespread availability of TG4 in the North&rdquo;. The Agreement clearly places responsibility for implementing these provisions on the British Government. There appears to be goodwill on the issue and we are beginning to move forward. Like the Deputy, I would like to see universal coverage of TG4 in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the carriage of TG4 on NTL cable in the North, I wrote to the Deputy recently <Col N="893" /> explaining the situation after he inquired about it. This is a matter, first and foremost, between the cable company and the station. I understand that NTL recently began to carry RTE programmes on a digital cable system. RTE would have preferred the station to be carried on the analog service because it would have reached more people. At present, digital cable take up is minimal and that is a problem.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the cable company and the station. I am aware of the Deputy's particular interest in this issue and he is welcome to keep in touch with me about it.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, this case was concluded in the High Court on 3 July 2000. The court directed that the site of the proposed visitor centre at Mullaghmore be restored. The court directed that the restoration be in accordance with a schedule of reinstatement work which was drawn up and agreed on that date. The required works will be carried out by the Office of Public Works before 30 May 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 31 May, the Minister indicated that the Office of Public Works had been asked to prepare a detailed reinstatement plan for the site. Is the Minister in receipt of that plan and can she outline what the major recommendations and difficulties are?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When An Bord Pleanála reached its final decision and that decision was made known, I contacted my legal advisers to examine the situation with regard to me making a judicial challenge to the decision. My legal advice was that such a challenge would not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then hoped that we would be able to look at the situation with regard to the Mullaghmore site and, given the sensitivity of the site, I considered that it might be appropriate to carry out an environmental appraisal of the likely impact of reinstatement. However, on 3 July the Honourable Mr. Justice Flood directed in the High Court that the site of the proposed visitor centre at Mullaghmore be restored. He further directed that a process of consultation take place between the relevant experts. Those discussions took place <Col N="894" /> and their purpose was to agree on the works to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood then made an order directing that the site be restored in accordance with that schedule. The schedule was drawn up on the direction of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial EU funding has already been spent on the site. What is the situation in that regard? Is the Minister obliged to refund that money or will it be withdrawn? The money was spent in error in light of the judgment in July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no secret, certainly in my constituency, that I was in favour of the proposed buildings at Mullaghmore and that I supported the previous Minister. However, the legal decisions were made before I came into office. The major decisions were taken on 12 February 1993 and 26 May 1993.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Clune that millions of pounds were spent on this site and it was for that reason, as well as many others, I had hoped this project could have gone ahead. That is obviously not the case as a result of the decision taken in the independent forum of An Bord Pleanála and following the direction of the court on 3 July. I see no way of recouping the money spent on the project.</P>

      <P>We agree on the sensitivity of the site and it is probably one of the first sites we have attempted to reconstruct. There are obviously great difficulties involved because of designation problems. Will an independent body assess the final product with regard to how satisfactorily it is reinstated? The cost factor is one thing but conditions were implied by the local authority initially and subsequently by An Bord Pleanála. Is the Minister confident that they can be adhered to and, second, satisfactorily restored through the reinstatement process?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 the options were that either the site would be reinstated or planning permission would be sought for the renewed application. The planning application took place and An Bord Pleanála turned it down. It was then for the court to make its judgment, which it did under the Honourable Mr. Justice Flood. The decision was that it should be reinstated. As I said earlier, we were directed by Mr. Justice Flood to consult with the experts to see how reinstatement would take place and to draw up the schedule for that. When that was drawn up we were directed that the schedule should be complete by 30 May 2001. That is the situation.</P>

      <P>The annual report for 1999, produced by RTE three weeks ago, shows that RTE has a serious deficit problem. The previous Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, permitted an index linked licence fee increase. Would this Minister not at least allow that increase given that the licence fee has been stagnant for some time? It is obvious that RTE cannot function with its current level of remuneration.</P>
      <P>I have examined the report. The number of new houses built in this country since 1997 &ndash; there were approximately 45,000 in 1999 &ndash; is striking but that is not reflected in the amount of licence fees being collected. That anomaly should be addressed. This is not reflected in the level of licence fee being collected and this anomaly must be addressed.</P>

That is my job, given my responsibility for broadcasting. RTE has not as yet put a proposal in writing to me with regard to the proposed licence fee increase but, given newspaper reports, I understand this will be forthcoming. Obviously it is not just a question of accepting the figures without knowing the arguments involved. However, I will give it every consideration when it finally reaches my desk.</P>

      <P>My question related to the £16 million shortfall in last year's accounts and what the Minister proposes to do about it. The other question which arises goes back to the point I raised earlier in relation to the proposals that may emanate from the EU Competition Policy Commissioner. Is the position of RTE not highly precarious at present and should the Minister not respond with much more urgency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that the Deputy is trying to scaremonger. There is no question of the Commission dealing in the way he has suggested; that has not happened. In considering the position of RTE and whether a licence fee increase is advisable at this time, I obviously must consider the arguments put forward. I must work also within the framework of the Government's anti-inflation strategy. I acknowledge there has been a shortfall in 1999 and it is also projected that there will be a shortfall for 2000.</P>
      <P>RTE has reported an operating deficit of £16.6 million for 1999 and a group surplus of £74.3 million was recorded. Most of this was made up from the sale of RTE's share of Cablelink, of which £130 million was received. The station is forecasting a deficit of approximately £12 million for 2000. As Minister responsible for broadcasting, I will be very interested to see the proposals put forward to me, as I believe they will, and I will consider them in a fair and dispassionate way. If I believe the issue and arguments are worth supporting, I will do so and seek the support of my Government colleagues in return.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the effectiveness of the collection system for the licence fee to which Deputy Clune has already referred? How many licence holders are there in the country? I understand An Post is responsible for the collection of the licence fee and, if so, what percentage of the licence fee goes to RTE and to administrative and collection costs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question relating to a number of statistics and I will be <Col N="897" /> pleased to get this information for the Deputy. He is correct in saying that An Post is responsible for the collection of the licence fee, and that is important. I also note the statement by Deputy Clune that more houses are being built and that, therefore, there should be a greater collection. That issue is worth considering.</P>

All these issues will be considered. The issue of indexation, as well as being put forward by Deputy Clune here today, has been put forward by RTE on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that time is of the essence in this case, given that there was a shortfall of £16.6 million last year and that a shortfall in the region of £12 million is projected for this year? The indications are that if this roll-over continues there will be great pressure on RTE to reduce home made programmes because it will not have the funding to continue to provide the service it has been providing heretofore. It is important for forward planning that RTE has an indication of its total source of income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have been very interested in the debate by the independent film makers and their different productions. Provision is made in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, for independent producers. I reiterate &ndash; this point should be accepted by the Deputy given that he outlined his concerns about the EU during Question Time &ndash; that there is no question of RTE being automatically entitled to an <Col N="898" /> increase regardless of the situation. This is important in the context of possible complaints to the European Commission about unacceptable State aids to RTE. Therefore, there must be a very balanced approach to this issue. There is a great deal to be considered and I can give the House an undertaking that once the proposals arrive on my desk, I will consider them in a planned and strategic way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 114, 127 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The EU directives for which my Department has responsibility have been implemented but the EU Commission has initiated legal action in relation to two directives, the habitats directive and the birds directive. Proceedings in regard to the habitats directive are based on the requirement to transmit a list of candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, in accordance with article 4(1) of the directive.</P>
      <P>The directive had been transposed into Irish law in March 1997 under the previous Administration. However, given that the viability of the Natura 2000 network to be set up under the directive is dependent on the co-operation and goodwill of landowners and users whose land is to be designated, I introduced a number of measures to ensure appropriate consultation with interested parties. These measures included the putting in place of local liaison committees, the introduction of informal channels for objections to designations and the establishment of an appeals advisory board under the chairmanship of former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills.</P>
      <P>Prior to my appointment as Minister, no candidate SAC had been transmitted to the Commission under the terms of the directive. Since then, however, 315 sites have been transmitted while 48 additional candidate SACs have yet to be transmitted because the landowners or users involved are engaged in the objection processes. The Commission is fully aware that while Ireland is technically not in full compliance with the directive, proposed SACs receive full protection under our national legislation. In the context of approval of EU funding for the national development plan I have accepted an overriding requirement to complete the formal transmission of sites by the end of November 2000. The Irish defence to the Commission's case has been submitted to the European Court of Justice and an oral hearing has been requested.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also initiated proceedings against Ireland in connection with over-grazing and the decline of the red grouse population in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex, a special protection area for birds under the EU birds directive. The rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, together with farm plans implementing commonage framework plans, will alleviate and recover the situation. I am awaiting approval from the Commission for my Department's scheme before implementing these plans.</P>
      <P>I am confident that all these measures will, when fully implemented, redress the over-grazing problem. The commonage plan for the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex is ready for implementation and will be initiated as soon as my Department's scheme receives approval from the Commission. In the meantime my Department, in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office, has prepared a defence of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reference to the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex indicates that the EU is still pursuing legal action. What is the position in regard to Directive No. 79/409/EEC? The Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland for non-implementation and the Minister said that she was mounting a vigorous defence in this regard. What is the up to date position? What is the nature of her defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister of State and myself took the opportunity to go to Brussels to discuss the issues with the EU Commissioner with responsibility for this area, with particular reference to the habitats directives. We outlined that while we supported the directive we wanted to ensure that people were given an opportunity to adhere to these proposals because a change in practice was involved.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that to bring about such co-operation, the Minister of State and I went to great lengths to ensure that there would be a structure into which people would have a direct input and under which they would be given an opportunity to appeal. That is provided for through the appeals advisory board under the chairmanship of Michael Mills and the liaison committees. I emphasise for those who say the Government or myself has been tardy with regard to submission of sites that no site had been transmitted before I took up office. There has been a substantial improvement in that position and we hope to comply with the directive by the end of next month.</P>
      <P>We have outlined our defence regarding the EU birds directive. The question of the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex has been examined because that involves a commonage plan. Commonages are not completely understood in terms of trying to implement directives in this regard. They are particular to Ireland in a legal sense. There has been a delay because of these domestic issues. It has not been due to disinterest, tardiness or laziness. We want to ensure that when these directives are implemented they have the utmost effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that 315 sites plus another 48 have been submitted. There is concern among NGOs in particular that approximately 600 more sites should be included. Is the Minister aware of their comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the debate in that regard and the views that have been put forward by some NGOs. The position is outlined in a reply to a later question. It is most important, however, to highlight that Ireland has taken this responsibility seriously. A high percentage of land is covered by such conservation and protection initiatives. In the context of a European league, Ireland would be in the middle in terms of the designation of sites. We have done well proportionately. Views have been put forward <Col N="901" /> and I am willing to listen to views which are forthcoming from other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been working in this area but the progress is slow given the level of protection needed for these sites. She stated that Ireland was technically in non-compliance. Does she agree that a number of sites are technically being destroyed? Will that inspire her to give more urgency to protection? She mentioned that sites are fully protected under national legislation. Does she accept this is far from adequate in regard to a number of sites where the protection is little other than in name only?</P>
      <P>She stated that appropriate consultations have taken place. Does she agree that given the level of objections from certain landowners who feel they were not adequately consulted prior to designation of their land that consultation was not appropriate? I know a further question has been tabled but in case it is not reached, I would like to tease out whether there has been any revision in the methodology of consultation so that the habitats and birds directives will be implemented and fully complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is preaching to the converted when he speaks to the Minister of State and myself about consultation. The one sure way for any of these directives to be effective is to have co-operation and there will not be co-operation if people do not have an opportunity to take part in the decision making process. Obviously, one is not going to have co-operation if people do not have an opportunity to take part in the decision-making process. I am sure the Deputy will be interested to learn that having had a number of discussions with the NGOs, particularly with regard to the Wildlife Bill that will be coming before the committee soon, a number of the NGOs that have been part of the appeals advisory system have said they found it very useful. They have been struck by the fact that it is clear that farming and conservation interests can work together successfully. The fact that we have had these processes has bridged a perception gap, if nothing else, and that in itself is important. The consultation is important and that is why we set up the structures. The Deputy will recall that no such structures existed before I took office.</P>
      <P>With regard to future consultations, the land owners and land users may request my officials to attend liaison committees and to discuss any problems that might arise. In addition, my Department is preparing management conservation plans for each site. Land owners and land users will be fully consulted on these plans before they are finalised.</P>

      <P>That is an important issue and with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to deal with it. I can understand why the Deputy is concerned about this. I am sure, however, that he is equally well aware that once these sites are designated they are legally protected. If he has any knowledge of any specific sites that are being destroyed he should let me and the Minister of State know.</P>

      <P>When will the habitats directive be implemented and what additional staff does the Minister have to see that it will be properly implemented? Every day of the week, any student of nature can see developers, land owners and even local authorities destroying habitats. The Minister mentioned a figure of 90 additional wildlife rangers, but that is only a drop in the ocean. We need at least a dozen people in each average sized county. What does the Minister realistically intend to do? There is no point in talking about implementing the habitats directive unless she has staff to oversee its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be well aware that we are implementing the directive. That is what this discussion is all about. It is the method of implementation that concerns us. We will be in a position to comply with the directive by the end of November this year. With regard to the wider issue to which the Deputy has referred, the directive takes special areas of conservation under its ambit. It does not concern every single case, only specific, sensitive areas. I will be interested to hear the Deputy's contribution on the Wildlife Bill when he can raise issues that are perhaps outside the area of SACs, not least the debate on hedgerows about which I very much agree with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's expressed concern about the implementation of EU directives &ndash; she has made various statements both recently and in the past &ndash; can she explain whether it was ever intended that an EU directive would actually impinge on the ability of a farmer to make a living from his holding? In the west, a farmer's lands have been designated and consequently the lands he can work to make a living have been reduced from 70 to 20 acres. As a result he has lost his livelihood as a farmer. I know that the Minister is concerned about such cases, and so am I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate clearly and unequivocally what the situation is with regard to that particular farmer? There is obvious confusion about the initial way in which the advertisement of those designations took place. There was no tangible way in which those people could discover what was going on. They found out inadvertently when it was too late. What recourse do they have at this stage? The way in which it was advertised did not make it open and available for everyone to see the designations that were publicly displayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has never refused an appeal. As regards the question of compensation, there is a compensation structure for actual loss of income. I take the Deputy's point that this matter has caused anxiety for a number of people. Perhaps that is one of the reasons I referred, as I did, to the question of directives. In my view, the implementation of those directives should be left to those who understand the sensitivities within individual member states. The Minister of State and I have worked hard to deal with the situation which was already a <i>fait accompli</i> when we took office. We have, however, certainly dealt with it in the fairest possible manner. We are looking to the EU to give the go ahead for the compensation package to which I referred earlier.</P>

    <Title>Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring earlier to airports and mentioned that Cork and Shannon airports are vital national assets and should be retained in public ownership. I had already referred to Dublin Airport. I said it would be unthinkable for anybody to suggest selling off our major harbours and ports. Likewise, it would be equally unthinkable to lose control of our main airports or, indeed, all our airports. Major problems are threatening the sustainable development of tourism, one of which is access to the regions. There are other problems facing our economy such as manpower availability, inflation and competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge imbalance in tourism growth at <Col N="905" /> present between the east coast and the rest of the country. One of the problems is that, with the traffic congestion on our roads, it takes more than four hours to travel from Cork to Dublin; the times are <i>pro rata</i> for other journeys. This problem is a huge disincentive to tourists who wish to travel outside the Dublin area. Our trains are packed and substandard and the air routes are extremely expensive for tourists. In terms of price, they are geared mainly towards the business sector.</P>
    <P>For example, a return air ticket between Dublin and Cork can cost between £90 and £140 for a 25 minute journey. This is exorbitant and is an obstacle to regional tourism development. It is also possibly due to the monopoly enjoyed by Aer Lingus on the route. If they plan ahead, travellers can fly from Dublin to London for £50 or £60, but it can cost up to £150 to travel to Cork. There must be something wrong in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future of Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports, I worry about the plans Aer Rianta announced for Cork last year when there was talk of a private consortium bidding to take over the airport. Aer Rianta then held a high profile briefing session in Cork and announced plans for major infrastructural development, costing more than £60 million at Cork Airport over the next five years. Do the main elements of those plans remain on schedule? The investment plans comprise four main elements &ndash; airfield, passenger and terminal cargo facilities and access. The current status of each of these elements should be disclosed by the Minister in her reply.</P>
    <P>Regarding the airfield, the main runway has been overlaid with asphalt and widened by the provision of 7.5 metre shoulders on both sides. This will upgrade the existing concrete surface and extend the life of the runway by approximately 15 to 20 years. An apron extension, together with the provision of a new taxiway and the upgrading of an existing taxiway, was scheduled to commence later this year. We were told this project would cost £8 million and take approximately 18 months to complete. Will the Minister give a guarantee that it will go ahead?</P>
    <P>Regarding the now overcrowded passenger terminal, the plan is to increase terminal capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per year by 2003 and to facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle growth of up to 5 million passengers per annum in the medium to long-term. What is the status of that proposal? In relation to cargo facilities, what is the status of the work that was due to commence midway through 2002? Will it go ahead on schedule? Regarding airport access, what is the position with regard to the new internal road systems and the provision of surface and multi-storey car parks? The growth in passenger traffic at Cork Airport is well in excess of all forecasts. This has created new pressures on the infrastructure. Will the Minister outline what exactly is happening in relation to Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>There is ongoing controversy about the role of the Department of Defence in opposing the <Col N="906" /> development of Eircom Park. South Dublin County Council recently gave planning permission for a 45,000 seat stadium in Dublin west. However, regrettably, the Minister for Defence and his Department have used an unpublished consultant's report to block that development. The contents of this report, which was carried out by a British consultant, Snow, are being put forward as reasons that the stadium should not be built.</P>
    <P>There is a Freedom of Information Act, but I have been refused access to that report on the grounds that it is still under consideration. This is appalling and the unpublished report is being used by the Government to torpedo the FAI's proposal to develop Eircom Park. The report is being intentionally suppressed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill could be used to introduce regulations that would allow a licence to be given now on the basis that, at some future date, Baldonnel could be developed as a commercial airport. Aeronautical safety standards could be cited as reasons to block Eircom Park. I understand the Air Corps has been quoted as saying that there is no problem with flight paths in relation to Eircom Park. However, the Minister for Defence and his Department objected to the planning application that the FAI submitted to South Dublin County Council. Part of the objection was that the stadium could interfere with operations at the aerodrome.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps is reported as saying that there is no problem in respect of military matters. However, in the Bill, the Minister for Public Enterprise is proposing to give herself the power to make new regulations in respect of commercial activities at Baldonnel. The Minister for Defence could then say to the Minister for Public Enterprise that he wished to see Baldonnel expanded in the future and become a commercial airport. He could request that regulations be put in place now with regard to air safety standards. There is every possibility at this stage that the stadium may not go ahead because of the behaviour of the Minister for Defence and his Department. Regulations should not be made earlier than one month prior to the commencement of operations if such operations are to commence at Baldonnel. Regulations should not be made on the hypothetical basis that, at some future date, the aerodrome will become a commercial airport.</P>
    <P>There is serious concern that the development of Eircom Park will be blocked by the Government to justify the construction of a national stadium at Abbotstown. Enough delaying mechanisms have been put in place already to stop the development of Eircom Park. People are most concerned that the Department of Defence will have an amendment made to the IAA Act to allow the IAA to have civil jurisdiction over military aerodromes. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, said in the Seanad that she would speak to the FAI to allay its fears, although the Department of Defence is attempting to block Eircom Park. Will the Minister outline if she has <Col N="907" /> spoken to the Minister for Defence and the FAI since she gave that undertaking in the Seanad? It would be a pity if this Bill could be used to defeat what has been done by the FAI. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Bill is pitiful legislation for the Minister to introduce in the House. Its name may give the impression that it deals with the serious questions involved in the development of aviation in the State. However, when on studying the legislation, one finds that it is pathetically narrow and deals only with the regulation of airport costs and a few other functions. The Bill's Title is entirely misleading in terms of its scope and the subjects for which it makes provision.</P>
      <P>It does not contain any recognition of the major challenges posed in many areas by the development of aviation in Ireland in the future. The Bill totally ignores the need for serious planned development of airports and air travel. It does not recognise the principles that must be developed on which the aviation industry has to be based for the future. Some of the serious environmental questions raised in regard to the future of air transport are totally ignored in the Bill. We have a major failure and a Bill masquerading as something which it is not. The Bill is merely preparing the ground for the eventual privatisation of Aer Rianta, the national publicly owned airport authority. That is the reason for this limitation.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Fianna Fáil's philosophy is to hand over every bit of public enterprise possible to private enterprise and private interests and to allow them to take it away on their own bat. Fianna Fáil in Government has been on a privatisation binge over the past three years. The Minister for Public Enterprise infamously presided over the privatisation of Telecom Éireann which turned into the Eircom debacle. The people should be warned to watch out for further privatisation, including that of Aer Rianta which is being prepared for by this Bill.</P>
      <P>One would have to go back to Cromwell's plunder to find an occasion like we saw at the recent annual general meeting of the shareholders of Eircom when so much was taken from so many for the benefit of so few. The people were conned into the idea that we had a shareowning democracy, that they could be part of it and that it would be to their benefit and to that of society. Every trick in the book was used to con the people along those lines, but we saw it was a gigantic sting to burn them out of their hard earned money. The benefits will now accrue to a small cabal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is precisely what the Government has in mind for Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and any other company if it gets away with it. Any preparation in the direction of the privatisation of the national airport authority should be vehemently resisted. <Col N="908" /> We should call the bluff of the Minister and the Government on this pretentious legislation.</P>
    <P>One important aspect which could have been covered by a proper and comprehensive Aviation Regulation Bill was brought to our attention by trade union members working at our national airports. According to section 14(1)(<i>h</i>) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, which I have studied in preparation for this debate, the operation, management and provision of services at aerodromes is supposed to come under the authority and direction of the Irish Aviation Authority. However, its remit ends when the aeroplanes arrive at the airport.</P>
    <P>The workers and trade union members who organise the many activities at the airports are extremely concerned about the safety implications of their work. An airport is a hive of activity before aeroplanes leave and after they arrive as vehicles are moving around them loading luggage and catering services. It is extremely disappointing and of great concern to airport workers that there is no attempt to ascribe responsibility for the health and safety of workers in this Bill. The Government has missed an opportunity to deal with these matters in a way that would be of advantage to the workers and therefore to the public. We need to ascribe responsibility for these matters. The Irish Aviation Authority and people who are briefed on health and safety matters and who could competently oversee and regulate activities at the airports should ensure the utmost safety of everyone using the airport, particularly the workforce. However, that is not happening at present. There are serious concerns which need to be addressed and that must be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other major aspect of aviation in this country and internationally which has not been taken into account is the enormous implications for the global environment by the development of air transport. As sober a body as the European Commission in a submission on air transport and the environment, which was drawn up in 1999, states some of the challenges, difficulties and problems which must be addressed. Paragraph 5 states:</P>
    <P>A vicious circle endangering the air transport industry's economic success, the Globe's environment and the quality of life of citizens has become a real threat. The combination of existing environmental legislation, local improvements at airport level and the industry's own efforts obviously do not suffice for reconciling pressing environmental needs with the development of an industry which is of vital importance for the competitiveness of the economy and for job creation. Accordingly, action is required targeting beyond business-as-usual improvements.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in this Bill of the action necessary beyond &ldquo;business-as-usual improvements&rdquo;. The problems are spelt out in detail by the European Commission. It also states: </P>
    <P>The air transport industry and Europe's citi<Col N="909" /> zens are increasingly facing the problems of success: Manifold environmental impacts of air transport are growing as well. Globally, it contributes to the greenhouse effect and to the depletion of the ozone layer, where high altitude emissions might be a specific problem. ... At local level, in the immediate vicinity of airports concerns focus on the potential health and environmental effects of noise and air pollution from emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and particulates.</P>
    <P>With the European aviation industry growing by approximately 10% per annum, these problems will increase in seriousness over the next few years if they are not addressed and if principles are not agreed by which they can be eliminated. An Aviation Regulation Bill should be one of the instruments by which the Government directs the attention of all towards the alleviation and resolution of these problems. However, there is not a word in the Bill in this regard. The same Commission report points out, on a simple enough matter, that 350,000 hours of flight by transport aircraft are wasted in Europe each year due to airport and air traffic management delays and non-optimal routings. Even by the measure of better management, a significant beginning could be made with regard to reducing the environmental problems.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any recognition in the Bill of what the future holds. Let us be quite clear. This problem will have to be faced some time down the line, sooner rather than later, because nobody in the media, the industry or Government is prepared to face up to it now. The headlong rush by certain airline companies to massively increase their profits by throwing offers at millions of people to get them into the skies in polluting aircraft is not sustainable in environmental terms. When I have to leave this country for work purposes I generally take an aircraft, so we are all implicated and involved in this issue but there has to be an objective audit of the relative costs of various forms of transport as far as the environment is concerned. In view of the planned growth of aviation, this will become an increasingly urgent and important issue.</P>
    <P>The irresponsible abandonment by globalised capitalism generally in the form of all kinds of private and multinational companies taking to the skies carrying goods in all directions has to be challenged. There is massive duplication as regards ferrying goods around the world both in and out of this country and every other country. I have no doubt that rationalisation will be forced upon people having regard to the whole question of environmental protection. When one looks around the shops and supermarkets at the goods that are ferried by aircraft from all points of the world one can see the senselessness of the current situation. European mineral water can be found on sale in North America and North American mineral water can be found on sale in Europe. There will be claims on the bottles as to how the <Col N="910" /> water is pristine and environmentally friendly, but they were carried by two planes which crossed each other in mid-Atlantic spewing out massive pollution in the process.</P>
    <P>A rationalisation would suggest that the production from each area should stay in each area and thereby massively reduce the pollution that would otherwise be incurred. Each plane that takes to the sky creates as much pollution as thousands of automobiles, which we know are already highly pollutant. There should also be rationalisation with regard to the production of vegetables, flowers and various other items. At the moment there is no rationalisation and no planning. Profit by private individuals and companies is the only touchstone. That is not sustainable and it is time the Government took cognisance of that but there is not the slightest hint of an awareness on its part of these challenges of the future, and of the here and now, in this Aviation Regulation Bill.</P>
    <P>The alternative to the direction the Government is taking is clear. There must be no question of the privatisation either of Aer Rianta or of Aer Lingus. They must be maintained in public ownership but there is room for major changes within the management structures. There is a crucial necessity for major changes within the management structures of those publicly owned organisations. For example, it is a scandal that Aer Lingus catering workers at Dublin Airport are paid less per hour than the McDonald's restaurant down the road pays. They now find themselves obliged to take industrial action to try to secure a decent level of wages. Is that the way for a publicly owned company to act?</P>
    <P>We need to clear out from the boards of publicly owned companies the hacks who have been stuffed in there over decades by the major political parties in one Government after another, whose only qualification was allegiance to a political party and who generally knew nothing about the industry or the area of public activity of the companies to which they were appointed. That is scandalous. We need boards that are generally representative of aviation workers, the people at the coal-face who do the work and who know the industry. All aspects of the aviation work force should be included on the boards genuinely representing the interests of their members. The customers who use the aviation services should be represented. The residents who abut the airports and who feel the effects of airport noise, pollution, etc. should be included, as well as environmental experts and advocates. That would create boards that are genuinely representative of the ordinary people and the workers concerned. They would come up with a policy that will provide the best service possible but with the least damage possible.</P>
    <P>There must also be an objective auditing, on an international basis, of the merits of various means of transport. This is a small country and train transport should be given priority because it is massively less polluting. With proper investment <Col N="911" /> in train transport, one could get from the edges to the centre and from the centre to the periphery almost as quickly as by aeroplane. The investment should be in that direction.</P>
    <P>Tá sé truamhéileach amach is amach ó thaobh an Aire agus ó thaobh an Rialtais de Bille chomh suarach leis seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.</P>

    <P>Níl aon tagairt sa Bhille do chúrsaí timpeallachta maidir le haer taisteal nó leis an truailliú a bhaineann le aer taisteal. Caithfear na ceisteanna tromchúiseacha seo a phlé agus plean cuimsitheach a chur chun cinn chun déileáil leis na ceisteanna. Is iad siúd na hábhair ba cheart a bheith sa Bhille seachas an rud suarach cúng a cuireadh os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is timely. With the expansion in recent times in aviation activity and the growth of our main airports, it is important that we have a regulation Bill of this nature. I come from the mid-west region and we all understand the importance of Shannon Airport to us. I welcome the increased volume of business in Shannon Airport in recent times, particularly the number of competitive airlines using Shannon.</P>
      <P>Air travel has become more popular, particularly as a result of competition. To a certain degree we owe a debt of gratitude to the likes of Ryanair, Virgin Airways and the other airlines which shook up the industry. In the past, Aer Lingus had a monopoly in the business and I am not certain that the consumer got good value. Competition has been the lifeblood of the aviation industry and has resulted in an increase in the number of people using the different airlines.</P>
      <P>Some of my colleagues focused on Farranfore Airport. There is a tendency to think of that airport in the context of Kerry and politicians representing Kerry are extremely vocal in protecting it. They recognise the importance of the national carrier flying into and out it on an ongoing basis. The national carrier, conscious of what is to happen in the future, may not consider it part of its role to fly into and out of small airports such as Farranfore. It is important for the national carrier to recognise that the development of regional airports is extremely important to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>West Limerick is contiguous to north Kerry and I am aware of many people from west Limerick who use Farranfore Airport. I am also aware of companies such as Kostal in Abbeyfeale with more than 1,000 employees who use Farranfore on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the importance <Col N="912" /> of Farranfore Airport is not exclusive to Kerry, it is important to west Limerick.</P>
    <P>It was with a degree of sadness that I read the inquiry into what happened to the four Air Corps pilots in that unfortunate accident on 1 July 1999. The inquiry concluded its deliberations and that report is compulsory reading for anyone who wants to get an appreciation of the Government's negligence, to a certain degree, in this area. It is regrettable those four people lost their lives in that tragedy when the objective in sea and air rescue research is to save lives, as those pilots were trying to do on that occasion. I agree with the objective that was sought by introducing a service of this nature on a 24 hour basis with effect from 1 July 1999, but it was negligent of the Government bodies who allowed that service to be introduced without having the necessary safety procedures in place. The Department of Defence and to a lesser extent the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources have a major responsibility in this area. Extreme pressure was exerted to provide this service. It is regrettable to note from the report that funding for the provision of the service outside of normal hours was not clarified before it was introduced.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Deasy, referred earlier to the questioning of the safety procedures of a service of this kind provided out of Waterford Airport. I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this report comprehensively in the House, which I advocated to our Whip. It deserves analysis to ensure the mistakes that led to the tragic loss of those four lives will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>Safety is paramount to the valuable rescue services provided by Air Corps pilots and others and there should be no penny-pinching in terms of safety measures in the provision of such services. Many people who venture out to sea or climb mountains often do not take account of important factors such as the weather forecast and they put the lives of people involved in rescue services, such as those Air Corps pilots, at risk.</P>
    <P>When I was party spokesperson for the marine I was conscious of the importance of the introduction of Bills such as the Marine Casualties Investigation Bill, but much more needs to be done to increase the safety awareness of those who go out to sea or climb mountains to ensure they observe safety codes and practices and do not put in jeopardy the lives of those involved in our rescue services who are often the unsung heroes of our country. How many times have we heard of people being rescued from the side of a mountain or having fallen down a precipice when they should not have ventured where they did. It behoves such people to be responsible.</P>
    <P>While Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel is a military air base, predictions have been made that it may evolve into being used for civilian activities. In the obsession to achieve the construction of a national stadium in Abbotstown, the cost of which has now been quantified at £1 billion, an attempt has been made to ensure that the FAI avail of that facility to make it more viable. It is <Col N="913" /> time the powers that be recognise that the FAI and those involved in Eircom Park, who have got together a package of £65 million, intend to embark on their own activities and to have their own stadium. People should recognise that the FAI has a right to proceed with Eircom Park and its intention is similar to that which prompted the GAA's expansion of Croke Park to a 75,000 seater stadium because it wanted to be independent and autonomous in its own right. If the FAI wants to proceed with that project and it has a package to fund, it should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Department of Defence, in its objections to South Dublin County Council and its previous objections, has probably been trying to obstruct the development of Eircom Park. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation displayed the height of bad manners when he promised he would report back to the people in Eircom Park within two weeks of having met them, but it took the issuing of a letter nine months later to arrange a meeting with him. That is evidence of a deliberate policy of obfuscation to ensure that venture does not proceed.</P>
    <P>While we recognise that safety is of the utmost importance with regard to airfields, Eircom Park and the FAI engaged two safety consultants with considerable aviation experience, one of whom carried out work for Aer Rianta on behalf of the Department of Defence with regard to Casement Aerodrome. In terms of the international safety codes administered out of Montreal, those consultants confirmed that the development of Eircom Park does not pose a safety hazard. That was also confirmed by the Air Corps. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation state that he had no objection to the development of Eircom Park proceeding. It is time we recognised that it will proceed, people want it to proceed and there should be an end to the obstruction to its development that appears to be taking place.</P>
    <P>Eircom Park is approximately four kilometres from Casement Aerodrome. Given that the Dublin Mountains lie behind that airfield and are on the same flight path and they are not viewed as a potential hazard, why should the development of Eircom Park be considered a safety hazard? If we have decided to proceed with the national stadium, I wish it well. However, was it decided to proceed with it when it was not part of the programme for Government or part of the interim programme that was arranged? Deputy Allen and I were almost jumped on because we questioned the Minister about it. There is an ultimate cost of up to £1 billion involved by the time the facility and infrastructure is in place. We would be irresponsible politicians if we did not question spending money of that nature and it behoves us as an Opposition to say: &ldquo;Stop the lights and let us look at this in the context of long-term viability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I question the viability of the project. Croke Park is an independent facility and while the rugby sector may avail of its facilities, we under<Col N="914" /> stand there is no athletics track there. Will it be viable in the long-term? We are all conscious of what happened with the Millennium Dome in London; it started as a millennium project, but it has now turned out to be the greatest white elephant in the UK. They are trying to get rid of it lock, stock and barrel. If we are not careful and do not look at this realistically in a long-term context, we might be reminded of how remiss we were. Those are areas that concern me.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Air Corps report, I hope it is read and the criticisms therein discussed here. Having read the report about the safety factors and the conditions in which these people went out, it is tragic that four people lost their lives. It is time to look at our sea and rescue services, particularly our use of helicopters. We have five Dauphin helicopters, one of which is based in Finner Camp and one in Waterford, but serious questions marks remain over this type of helicopter. We ordered them in 1982 and got them in 1986, but the company which produced them no longer produces that model. An engineer states in the report that it is difficult to get spare parts for it and remarks on the avionics of the craft; he speaks about cannibalising other helicopters in order to get parts. This has focused attention on defence, the role of the Air Corps and equipment. We must analyse this situation. It is not satisfactory and that is why I look forward to a worthwhile debate about our future plans in this regard. If we decide to use Waterford we must put in the infrastructure and ensure that it is safe to use.</P>
    <P>I could talk much more about aviation and Members have raised different aspects of the subject. Regarding Aer Lingus and Farranfore, I hope Aer Lingus does not abdicate its responsibilities there. I know it is probably looking at the international scene and wondering whether small regional airports are important, but, as has been said here many times, decentralisation and moving activity out of large urban areas is important and the regional airports are vital to the success of such action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to section 46, Part V, of this Bill which will have enormous implications for the people of my constituency. This section proposes amending the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, by inserting a subsection which states that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Defence, for the purpose of the licensing and regulation of aerodromes and the regulation of aeronautical safety standards at aerodromes, prescribe in regulations that sections 58(1) and 60, and such other provisions of this Act as specified in the regulations, shall apply to civil aviation operations at such aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence, as may be specified in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I understand that to mean that the Government plans to open up Baldonnel Airport to civil aviation. I know of no other aerodrome or airport owned by the Minister for Defence and which would lend itself to being commercialised or civilianised as this section proposes. It does not say that directly or in so many words, but that is what it means. I understand the plan being hatched by the Government for Baldonnel is to allow commercial aviation operators to use Baldonnel for a range of operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, we are not hatching anything. There is no plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a useful intervention and I am sure the Minister will clarify it further; she will have an opportunity to state categorically that the Government does not intend to have Baldonnel used for commercial aviation purposes, if that is what she is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, what is this section about? Why is it here? It is here to allow for the civilian part of the operations of an airport which is currently under the Minister for Defence to come under the Irish Aviation Authority. No matter what construction one puts on it, that means Baldonnel. There is no other airport I am aware of that would have the level of aviation activity which would require it to be covered by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify when winding up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that plans have been discussed for some time which would allow Baldonnel to be used for civilian aviation purposes, mainly to provide facilities for cargo, freight, training, flying clubs, private executive and business jets and a range of overnight activity. I know that an organisation called the Baldonnel Liaison Group had some communication with the Department and was informed that the thinking was that in order for a civil aviation operation to work, a level of about ten to 12 flights per hour would be needed. I am also informed that it is thought that Baldonnel could be operated on a 24 hour basis and that it would be more likely that up to 20 flights per hour would use Baldonnel. One is therefore looking at approximately 400 to 500 flights per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that concerns me is that the flight path to and from Baldonnel is directly over a large part of my constituency. There is a range of areas in my constituency which are directly in the Baldonnel approach corridor and within two miles of the central line of that corridor &ndash; areas such as Killiney, Dalkey, Ballybrack, Loughlinstown, Glasthule, Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Monkstown, Sallynoggin, Glenageary, Deans<Col N="916" /> grange, Foxrock, Cabinteely, Cornelscourt, Stillorgan, Booterstown and Leopardstown.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the people who live in those areas will be greatly concerned that the Government is slipping into the Aviation Regulation Bill a measure under the miscellaneous part of the Bill which will allow Baldonnel to be civilianised. Of course, it does not declare it openly.</P>

      <P>By the time people wake up to what is really going on, the Minister will be gone, she will have washed her hands of it, the whole matter will then be in the hands of the aviation commissioner and the Minister, when questioned about it, will say she no longer has any responsibility for it and that it is now in the hands of the regulator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be listening very intently for the clarification. There is either a purpose in this particular provision being in the Bill or there is not. I cannot see any other purpose for this provision being in the Bill other than an intent to operate civilian flights in and out of Baldonnel. The obvious concerns that my constituents will have with this proposal will be the possibility of air accidents. We know that a large number of air accidents occur close to airports and if the flight path is over a densely populated area, that poses particular dangers and concerns. There would be a concern about noise if Baldonnel is to be used as a cargo freight airport because the types of aircraft used for cargo and freight operations tend to be heavier, older aircraft and, consequently, they tend to be noisier and more prone to accidents. There is, of course, the concern that people will have in relation to pollution.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has said she intends to clarify the position, and I very much look forward to that clarification because a clear statement of the Government's intentions in relation to Baldonnel is long overdue. If it is, as would appear from the measure being slipped into the miscellaneous portion of this Bill, the Government's intention to have Baldonnel operating on a civilian basis, then the Government should state exactly what it is. The Minister should state what she is planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An opportunity should be given to the people and the communities who live in the areas which would be affected by civil operations and a big increase in the level of aviation activity at Baldonnel to have some input into what is being done rather than what I see happening here, that is, a measure being tacked on to the end of the <Col N="917" /> Aviation Regulation Bill which would allow Baldonnel to be civilianised and the Minister to wash her hands of it when there is an outcry over the implications of a large increase in the level of air traffic in and out of Baldonnel.</P>

      <P>The provisions are simply and only to lift the impediments in the Irish Aviation Authority Act to enable it carry out its remit of safety at a military aerodrome. In fact, the aerodrome which was in mind was Gormanston airport in County Meath for a flight training school. Apparently the Department of Defence has proposals for a flight training school at Gormanston.</P>

      <P>There is no point sneaking in proposals in relation to Baldonnel which will have major effects on the people who live along the flight path to and from that airport. I have given the Minister an opportunity to clarify the position. Typical of the Minister, she gave me an explanation not in relation to what I asked about, Baldonnel, but about Gormanston. Perhaps when she has had an opportunity to reflect on what I have had to say and the concerns I have expressed on behalf of the constituents I represent and when she is replying to the debate, she will give a clear unambiguous statement of the Government's plans and intentions in relation to Baldonnel. I am disappointed that when I uniquely gave way to her to allow her an oppor<Col N="918" /> tunity to do so, she avoided that particular question and replied to something about which I had not asked her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister faces a series of problems as Minister for Public Enterprise and the consequences of this Bill will pose their own set of problems for her. The Government has set out its programme contained in the national development plan. We have, as a country, unprecedented opportunities and apparently unlimited resources for Government, at least in the context of the budgetary surplus the Minister for Finance will have this year, yet the Government is intent on a range of issues is to move things from Dublin, including State Departments, industry, outreach colleges and so on and I strongly support that. This city is literally choking to death. I drive to Dublin twice a week and it takes almost as long to get from Castlebar to Heuston Station as from Heuston Station to the Dáil. Any traffic blip causes major problems and much stress and concern for a great number of people, not to mention the loss of business and damage to the economy.</P>
      <P>I was in Seoul, South Korea, as Minister for trade and a similar situation arose in what is a much larger city. The involvement of so many people and so much business resulted in constant gridlock with the result that international business pulled out as people did not wish to do business there because it took too long to get from A to B for meetings or whatever. A similar situation is evolving in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have a few suggestions as to how we might deal with this. The Minister is interested in seeing that as many parts of the country as possible share the benefits of the growing economy. It is said that the number of new cars bought in Dublin so far this year would stretch for 100 miles if one placed them bumper to bumper. Last Friday I drove from Belfast to Tipperary and back to Castlebar and it was a constant line of traffic for over 300 miles. That is incredible given the kind of country we used to be and where we now are. Much of this development is for the better but much of it has nothing to do with any quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International business people or investors involved in high-tech industries or whatever who wish to come to Ireland respectively list access to international airports, third level education and <Col N="919" /> the quality of life to which they aspire as being critical and far more important than money. They are coming here to raise their children with a sense of safety and in the knowledge they will receive an education. However, they also need facilities such as international aviation contact, access to third level research and development facilities and so on.</P>
    <P>Knock airport, which is well known to the Minister, is a case in point. As Minister for tourism I attended the Berlin travel trade show, the largest such show in the world, when I was accompanied by representatives of Irish interest groups. One of the things I discovered was that people had never heard of Connacht regional airport &ndash; Knock airport. This meant that tour operators were flying fishermen into Shannon who would then have to travel north to Carrick-on-Shannon, Cavan or wherever if they were involved in coarse fishing. Following meetings charter flights now fly directly to Knock from the Continent, saving everyone time, reducing traffic and so on.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is chaotic &ndash; it is one of the worst airports I have been in. I passed through it some time ago returning from England and as a result of the maze of building going on a woman who had difficulty walking but did not require a wheelchair got to a stage where she could not descend a flight of stairs and we had to summon assistance for her. The huge increase in the number of people passing through the airport has meant that the kind of development which should have taken place has not taken place and I know the Minister is dealing with that.</P>
    <P>Many people from the greater Connacht area &ndash; Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Galway as far up as the Minister's town of Athlone &ndash; travel to Dublin to fly to London as there are 60 or 70 flights per day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They could easily go to Knock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be much easier for them to go to Knock. If Aer Lingus has 60 flights per day to Heathrow Airport, surely it should be possible, not for the Government to order it, but to arrange that some consideration should be given to having some of those flights travelling from Knock airport to destinations in England. Such flights would be full every day in both directions as business which travels from this area through Dublin Airport has to return to the region.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the internal situation concerning subsidised flights from Galway to Dublin involving Aer Arann. Ryanair was the saviour of Knock airport in one way but now has a monopoly. It provided flights when Aer Lingus would not do so, but now has it all its own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support deregulation and competition. Today I wrote to the chairman of Aer Lingus about this situation. It is practical to suggest that some of the flights travelling from Dub<Col N="920" /> lin to Manchester, Liverpool or London in particular, should depart from Knock and take a significant number of people from that region rather than bringing them to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the management want it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Discussions are ongoing on the structure and future of the board but this option should be seriously considered.</P>
      <P>As politicians we all blame the Government for not doing this or that. I accept that, under EU regulations, the Minister cannot directly assist the airport. However, it is possible for Government to argue that this airport is in the centre of the BMW region and there are other infrastructural necessities which should be prioritised by Government and which it can directly assist. The National Roads Authority has stated it will be 20 years before the N5 connects Longford and Charlestown by which time many new Members will have left. Design offices have been set up and so on. However, we are one year into the national development plan but we have not done anything about this issue as no forward acquisition of land has taken place in many areas. The Government will have a problem spending the allocations given to it over the period of the national plan. Whoever is in Government in three years will probably be in Brussels arguing that we have not been able to spend the money and asking for another three years in which to do so. Government could assist in providing roads, water and other infrastructure for the Knock airport hinterland so it becomes more attractive and so things can happen if the structure of the board is changed or it achieves results or whatever.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Dallas some years ago when we brought over a subsidiary of the Perot group &ndash; the Alliance Corporation &ndash; which carried out a large analysis of the possibilities for Knock and recommended tax designation as one possible catalyst. The then Government introduced a tax designation package for all regional airports. However, it never came to fruition as I would have liked. A contract was recently signed for a fairly substantial development at Knock and that is starting. However, it is in its infancy. Government in general, and Deputy O'Rourke as an influential Minister from the midlands, should be able to progress some of the other infrastructural projects which would make an impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the current issues which to some extent involves aviation, is the helicopter emergency rescue service &ndash; HEMS. I do not know whether the unfortunate people lost off Slyne Head in the past two days or those who died having been airlifted to hospital could have been saved in the first critical hour if a HEMS helicopter with full medical equipment had been able to airlift them. Knock airport would be an ideal centre for such a service. The Department of Health and Children does not give this issue any priority as it argues it has other measures to provide the best health ser<Col N="921" /> vice available. However, money and European backing are available for this service and I would like to think Deputy O'Rourke, in her capacity as a west of Ireland Minister, would back the HEMS concept. For years this House debated locating the air-sea marine rescue service anywhere in the west and, since its introduction, it has been a huge success and has saved many lives. HEMS with full medical equipment could be critical in saving lives in the first critical hour.</P>
    <P>Despite having a Minister in Government dealing with the BMW region, despite all the Government's words and the priorities in the White Papers, we still suffer seriously from lack of stability of power and lack of major infrastructure in terms of roads and water. The gas line is now coming in from the Atlantic and the company in question is dealing with Bord Gais in connection with the line to Galway and so on. Companies who buy gas directly from that line may set up their own combined heat and power facilities, which will generate an element of electricity also.</P>
    <P>We have built our reputation on being the island of saints and scholars. The saints may have gone, but we still have an opportunity in the scholarly area. I am concerned that people involved in high-tech business, particularly in the United States, who are interested in coming to Ireland, cannot go west of the Shannon because of the power problems and the lack of access to an international airport. The Knock Airport runway is extendible, should that be necessary, but I do not think it is. The Minister has met and spoken with members of the board. Encouragement to meet set targets and objectives could be followed up by Government. I am not sure whether the Minister intends to change the structure of the board. It has been rumoured that the company might be sold.</P>

While direct Government funding cannot be given, the surrounding area should be prioritised by Government and the Minister, in her capacity as Minister for Public Enterprise can do that. I know she has concerns about Dublin, Cork and Shannon. However, an international-size runway in the centre of the BMW region as a hub should be an attraction for industry, provided other facilities that can be provided by Govern<Col N="922" /> ment, are provided. I hope the Minister will play her part visibly in the time ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a contribution to the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000. The aviation industry has played a significant role in the development of our economy over the years. As a Deputy for the Dublin North constituency, I am conscious of the role played by Dublin Airport in the economic life of the people of the area. For many years the airport was the main employer in the region and it continues to be a significant player in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of a commission to deal with a number of areas: the approval of airport and air traffic control charges; the approval of ground handling service providers at airports; the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland; the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports; licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's initiative on the allocation of take-off and landing slots, I note that the representatives of the two main aircraft carriers at Dublin Airport, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, have stated publicly that this initiative was not sought by them. Neither do they deem it to be of significant importance at this stage, given the problems that exist at Dublin Airport. It seems the Minister got this wrong. I look forward to her comments when responding to this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for public safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will listen to the Minister when she is summing up. The appointment of the new Aviation Regulator with responsibility for the regulation, among other things, of landing charges at the airport is to be welcomed. It is hoped that this will keep Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair off the airwaves with his outlandish, inaccurate and very selective allegations about the charges being imposed by Aer Rianta up to now. The Minister confirmed that there have been no increases in tariffs since about 1987. I am firmly of the opinion that Mr. O'Leary was deliberately seeking free publicity for his airline at a time when he was well aware that his allegations would not stand up to critical independent analysis. There are other aspects of his whole operation that he should be addressing in the interests of passengers, rather than trying to get cheap publicity on this issue. I hope this will come to an end and that it will not become a political football.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety at airports is fundamental for all of us, particularly for staff, customers and the general public working at and using them. Over the years Aer Rianta has set a very high standard with regard to safety. In view of this I am deeply concerned at the situation that has developed at Dublin Airport, particularly over the summer <Col N="923" /> period. I have had numerous telephone calls from staff and passengers concerned at the congestion and the unorthodox methods which had to be taken by passengers in the interests of their own safety. It is unprecedented that a company such as Aer Lingus publicly announced that it was dissatisfied with the safety arrangements at the airport. I am aware that discussions are ongoing between Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus to resolve this problem. I hope it will be resolved as a matter of urgency, but it went on too long before the Minister told the board to get its act together.</P>
    <P>Over the years the staff of Aer Rianta, from the bottom up, have always given me the clear impression of being a very contented and co-operative work force. Having spoken with a number of staff members at various levels in recent months, it seems that a major change has taken place. As someone who has always supported Aer Rianta over the years, I am very disturbed at this development, because I do not think it is in the interests of the company. This is something about which the Minister should be concerned. A well-motivated, contented and happy work force will facilitate change in the industry in a more positive way. The departure of senior management in recent years, beginning with the previous chief executive, is observed and referred to by the work force in general when one speaks to workers about the airport and the attitude that prevails there. I also note that the recent senior appointments at our airports have come from outside the existing work force. I am not saying for one moment that a person from outside the country should not have such opportunities just as people from this country have an opportunity of competing for senior positions in companies situated outside Ireland, but there has been a noticeable change of attitude. I want to pose the following questions. Is there a deliberate policy to go over the heads of existing staff for such appointments? Is there a political game being played at board level? As a Deputy for the constituency in which Dublin Airport is situated, I am deeply concerned and I know that I am also expressing the feeling of many of the staff. There is a feeling that things are not as they were, that the relationship between management and workforce is not as it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking about Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta in this instance. With the changes which have taken place at senior level, there is a feeling that there is another game being played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff are also extremely anxious about their future in Aer Rianta as the Minister refuses to make a decision about the IPO. As far as I am concerned, and I have looked into this clearly, Aer Rianta should remain a State owned body. Obviously I am not in Government at present but I want to state clearly that there are no circum<Col N="924" /> stances in which I would want to see a situation where the majority shareholding would be let out of the hands of the State. After all, the vast majority of airports in Europe are still in public ownership.</P>
    <P>The huge growth in air traffic to and from Dublin Airport has raised public awareness of environmental issues. While acknowledging the need for, and advantages of, an airport in north County Dublin the company must become more aware of environmental issues just as the public are aware of them. We must minimise the impact on the environment and on the families living around the airport. Over the past ten or 15 years due to the noise pollution the quality of the environment has worsened significantly in the area of St. Margaret's and Portmarnock, which are on the existing flight path. I must concede that the problems in St. Margaret's have been reduced considerably by the installation of a new insulation scheme funded by Aer Rianta because I was involved in the discussions myself. However, the problem for the residents in the greater Portmarnock area needs to be assessed and a re-evaluation of the situation must be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Airport noise, as Members will be aware, has been recognised as the most intrusive and disturbing aspect of airport operations. The effect of this on the residents of Portmarnock in particular must be considered therefore in the context of proposals for the construction of a second parallel runway at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister must answer the following question. Does Government policy allow passenger numbers to increase indefinitely at the airport? Last year some 12.8 million went through Dublin Airport and this year the projected figure is up to 14 million passengers. Is it envisaged that the number will increase to 20 million or 25 million passengers?</P>
    <P>To proceed with the second parallel runway would increase the capacity of the airport by more than a factor of two and would have implications for the 12,000 or 13,000 residents of Portmarnock. In this scenario, two issues would have to be considered &ndash; the surface access to the capital and the implications for the residents of Portmarnock.</P>
    <P>Surface access continues to be a problem for Dublin Airport. Notwithstanding the improvements which have been made at the roundabout at the main entrance to the airport, with a projected passenger throughput for this year of up to 14 million there are still access problems and delays travelling to and from the city. While accepting that the recent proposals by the Minister and the Government for a long awaited rail network to Dublin Airport, which we were promised on a number of occasions, will become a reality, it would seem that this would not come into operation for at least five or seven years. Even allowing for that, if this second runway, which would increase capacity to 40 million passengers, were put into operation, it would have major implications on the area. The following <Col N="925" /> question must be posed: do we need it, and it is in the interests of the environment and of the people in the area that an airport should be allowed to expand to such a size? For example, there are proposals to build new airports in both Paris and London to deal with the projected growth in air traffic in those cities.</P>
    <P>One of the concerns emerging among the people of the greater Portmarnock area is that even at present aircraft taking off on Runway One Zero turn left inside the outer marker. That, in effect, brings them closer to the resident population of Portmarnock and what we are saying is that a directive should be given by the Minister that flights taking off from this runway should not be allowed turn left inside the outer marker. The same applies with aircraft landing at Dublin Airport. At night, cargo aircraft, the level of which must be increasing continually, approach along the Irish coast and turn left on to Runway Two Eight. They are not going out to the outer marker and are approaching Dublin Airport over houses. This is unacceptable and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>A realistic evaluation should be made on the proposal for a second runway at Dublin Airport before it goes any further. I do not think it is necessary. A target capacity of 22 million or 25 million passengers would be acceptable at Dublin Airport, but the implications on the environment and the people of Portmarnock, in particular, of going beyond that to up to 40 million passengers are unacceptable. In addition the implications for access to and from Dublin would not be acceptable. There is a view among the people that it is not desirable and that Aer Rianta should look seriously at another location.</P>
    <P>As a spokesperson on older person's issues, I believe that the pension scheme for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta employees is an utter scandal. We have all heard the Minister's proposals about privatisation and her other proposals for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. If the Minister has any interest in the welfare of the staff and the workers who put in so much effort to develop Dublin Airport she should implement a proper pension scheme. The new pension scheme proposals which have emanated from a committee do not take on board the concerns of pensioners who have given 30 or 40 years of their life to Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus. That is unacceptable. Improvements in the scheme are envisaged for existing staff. The Minister should put down a marker with the Government at a time of unparalleled growth and finances. Given that the Minister for Finance has more money available to him than ever before, that issue could be dealt with adequately.</P>
    <P>The issue of Baldonnel has arisen on a couple of occasions, particularly in the context of the proposed Eircom Park stadium. I have raised this matter with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on various occasions. There is a strong view that the Government is using the <Col N="926" /> Department of Defence to ensure Eircom Park does not get off the ground.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from SIPTU about the definition of &ldquo;airport users&rdquo; and about sections 10, 32 and 33. I have no doubt these will be taken on board by our spokesperson, Deputy Stagg, on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The reason I am on my feet is that a major debate is taking place about the airline structure. I listened to Deputy Ryan and I compliment him on his contribution on Dublin Airport, what is happening in relation to passenger numbers and the dispute between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, where one is of the view that there is not enough room for the other. We do not have that problem in the west where there is no shortage of airports &ndash; if the Government has its way there will be more airports in the west.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to any development in the west. I come from the west and support any development there. I have spoken on many occasions in the Dáil about the inadequate infrastructure in the west &ndash; for example, the road from Longford to Charlestown and the rail service which was in dispute for ten weeks during the summer. We still do not have a midday train to Westport. Passengers travelling to Dublin do not know whether they will travel to Athlone by bus or train. In the evening they do not know whether they will be on a bus or an ass and cart, or how they will travel home to the west. Because of a new arrangement which has been agreed, we are told the problems have been solved. What has that to do with aviation?</P>
      <P>We have a famous airport at Knock which is mentioned in song and in folklore and has caused major controversy. Successive Governments have not played their part in relation to the infrastructure for Knock Airport. Tax designation was provided for by the last Government. That airport has waited for many years for approval from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for water and sewerage. There are acres of land which could be developed. This could help the people in the west. There is no proper water and sewerage scheme. What exists is a well. I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government is present. Perhaps he will take note of this and his Department will give approval for the water and sewerage scheme for Knock.</P>

      <P>There are airports at Knock, Galway, Shannon and Sligo. The Government has lands in Oranmore. A political dispute is ongoing between the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Fahey. One is attempting to take credit for what is taking place in Galway city with a view to getting extra votes although the party has three seats. Given what is happening, I do not know whether the party will have one seat because the people are getting annoyed about one competing with the other.</P>
      <P>There is a new proposal now. The Department of Defence has land in Oranmore. This morning the Minister told a colleague of mine she would play her part if the land was made available to have a third regional airport in the west. The airport at Knock is dying on its feet, Shannon Airport is experiencing major difficulties because of the Shannon stop-over and tourism has been affected. Denis O'Brien who made millions of pounds from telephones is about to invest £25 million. He got enough soft State money from the telephones and he hopes the State will provide free land, that the Government will grant-aid the airport and he will invest his £25 million. Five years down the road he will sell on and have £100 million to buy more airports elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It would be outrageous for any Government to assist, grant-aid or play any part in putting a third airport in the west. The BMW region qualifies for Objective One status. Regardless of whether Galway likes it, we are all part of the one region, the west region. In Galway there is the regional hospital, educational facilities and major investment in jobs. I hope what was done to Dublin for the past 30 years will not be done to Galway. It was thought there would never be enough infrastructure, jobs, buildings and cars in Dublin. Since all those facilities have been provided the people of Dublin have been gridlocked and an attempt is being made to decentralise Departments to ease the gridlock.</P>
      <P>The Government wants to support a third airport because there is an investor who got £25 million. Government agencies should not help individuals to put a third airport in place which would finish off Knock Airport. I accept there are problems at Knock Airport. I ask the Minister to agree to meet the five TDs and Senators representing County Mayo immediately to see if the Government can put in place some measure to assist Knock Airport. If that does not happen, Knock Airport will be unable to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an industrialist came to this country seeking grant aid from the IDA to set up a biscuit factory and there was an existing biscuit factory in Galway, Mayo or Shannon, he would not get that grant aid. Giving grant aid in that case would amount to assisting him in putting somebody else out of business. I cannot understand how the Government can encourage such a situation in relation to airports by making available land which is owned by the taxpayer and under the control of the Department of Defence. I put down a parliamentary <Col N="928" /> question in this regard yesterday to which I received a hidden, not a truthful, reply. The Government could not answer the question.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against Galway but I oppose a third airport in the region. Galway is one hour from Knock and one hour from Shannon. There is no need for another international airport. However, there is a need for support, grant aid, infrastructure and anything else that can be done to encourage other carriers to come to Knock. At present, Ryanair is in Knock while Aer Lingus provides flights once a week. The Minister should put pressure on the national carrier to provide services to Knock. During the summer emigrants complained to me that certain airlines were advertising lower prices for flights into Knock but when they inquired from the airlines or travel agents they discovered that those prices were booked up. Instead of getting the £75 or £80 fare, these people had to pay £170 and more.</P>

We want that airport to survive and do not want another airport competing with it. That would be political madness and a waste of resources. If the Government wishes to help the west, there are many infrastructure projects it can fund and I hope it will do that. I urge the Minister to meet the Members of the Oireachtas from County Mayo to see how Knock Airport can be supported and encouraged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time. The Bill has much to recommend it. The Minister stated that the proposed commission will take responsibility for the approval of airport, air and traffic control charges, approval of ground handling service providers at airports, the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports and licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. They are worthwhile tasks for the commission.</P>
      <P>There have been difficulties in recent years with regard to Ryanair, airport charges at Dublin Airport and the difficulties Ryanair is experiencing with the provision of ground handling services. It is good policy to transfer those issues from the Department of Public Enterprise to the remit of the commission, which can give them particular attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody envisaged the increase in air traffic at Dublin Airport in recent years. I listened to Deputy Ryan speak about Aer Rianta and its role at Dublin Airport. I have no difficulty with Aer Rianta being involved in providing sales and ser<Col N="929" /> vices at Dublin Airport but we should look at the situation in a new light. The Government has a great deal of extra funding available to it and given that this country has now become a commercial enterprise, there is an opportunity for the Government and semi-State bodies to get out of running profitable airports. This Government or a future Government should seriously consider selling Dublin Airport to a commercial body. It can pay its way now so there is no need for Government intervention.</P>
    <P>The Government should also consider providing another commercial airport at Baldonnel. Air traffic will continue to grow rapidly and two airports are needed to service the amount of air traffic coming to Dublin. All Members have been in Dublin Airport recently. It is becoming more like a jungle. It is more difficult to get on the aeroplane or to get parking. Land is also a difficulty. The provision of a commercially run second airport at Baldonnel would be worthwhile for many reasons.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, should involve itself in the administration of regional airports. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ring, with regard to Knock Airport and the other regional airports. I represent the Sligo-Leitrim constituency which has a fine airport at Strandhill in Sligo. However, it is always in financial trouble. We have had numerous meetings with different Ministers seeking extra funding to ensure the survival of that airport. The service that airport could provide if proper funding were made available to it would be most welcome. It could have an important role by providing an extra element of infrastructural development in the region.</P>
    <P>We have not succeeded in bringing large industries into Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal for a number of years. One of the reasons for that is that the area does not have a good airport. The Government was unable to provide the money for it. However, the Government is now able to give money to Dublin Airport. The commercial sector would willingly run Dublin Airport and run it successfully so the money the Government would save could and should be spent on the airports in Sligo, Knock, Waterford, Cork and Shannon.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport has been experiencing difficulty since the removal of the transatlantic stopover. However, a number of carriers such as Virgin, Ryanair and Aeroflot have started services at Shannon. The Government should change its thinking and realise that money must be spent on regional airports and air infrastructure rather than on Dublin Airport, which can survive commercially. That is the extraordinary role the Government could play. It would require a diverse and brave policy decision. I hope my view will be conveyed to the Minister and that she will consider adopting this attitude and provide much needed funding for regional airports. Industry will not be brought into the regions if there is no proper airport structure.</P>
    <P>It seems illogical, as Deputy Ring has said, that <Col N="930" /> we are now talking about dispersing large numbers of civil servants throughout the country, taking them away from the Dublin and eastern region and not putting the infrastructure in place which would help bring large industries into these regions. On numerous occasions when industrialists visited the north-west region they found that apart from the road structure, which is being improved slowly but surely at present, the rail structure, airport structure and air navigation structure in the region was extremely poor. The staff who work at regional airports, particularly Strandhill airport, work very hard. It is a day-to-day battle for them to survive. It is difficult for them to get airlines to use the airport. Aer Lingus has withdrawn from Sligo and there is not a sufficient air service to Dublin. This is a result of the lack of Government aid and money. If the Government can look at the whole aspect of ridding itself of the airports that are profitable and put in place the necessary funding for the regional airports, it will have done an excellent day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past 15 years a network of five modern regional airports has been developed to serve the most remote coastal areas in Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Kerry, together with Waterford in the south-east and Knock International Airport. These airports have proved to be of great significance as an element of vital transport infrastructure to support social and economic development in these peripheral regions. I agree with Deputy Ring that major investment is needed in the regional airports, particularly Knock airport. This goes back to the argument that if one has two cars one will need two sets of tyres. There is the question of additional airports rather than proper investment in existing airports, which raises certain questions.</P>
      <P>The principal function of the commission will be to regulate airport charges and aviation terminal service charges. However, I would like to refer to the role and growth of regional airports. Aer Lingus is preparing for the flotation of the company which will be similar to that of the Eircom debacle when many investors got burnt. Aer Lingus fails to understand that the regional airports, which are considered the poor relation, are regarded by the tourism and industrial development agencies as crucial in both attracting and retaining inward investment in disadvantaged areas. Modern high-tech and information technology industries are unlikely to go to areas which do not have a high level of easy access to overseas markets. An EU project carried out in 1991 on regional airport development and promotion stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Airports assist the economic development of Europe's regions, by providing the infrastructure which enhances transport and communication links to other regions and the major conurbations This function is particularly important when the region is on the periphery of Europe. The existence and success of a <Col N="931" /> regional airport is increasingly critical for the development and economic success of a region as a whole.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated in the national development plan to regional airports is very disappointing. I speak from a Sligo perspective and were it not for the huge commitment of the staff in that region, the airport would not be nearly as successful as it is. The staff at that airport work tirelessly to provide the service but the funding provided by the State is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>The most important factor in the success of our regional airports to date has been the provision of regular scheduled flights, linking the regions to Europe, through Dublin and the UK. It is of the utmost importance that these services are fully maintained and that all the regional airports are provided with the highest possible standard of internal services. The real problem is that Aer Lingus had a contract with Sligo airport and this has now been replaced by Aer Arann which is providing a very good service. It is using a Shorts plane which has a non-pressurised cabin. If Aer Lingus had a choice it would offload all the regional airports to Aer Arann or a similar carrier. It is tidying up its back garden before flotation and considers the regional airports a hindrance rather than profitable. If Aer Arann is to take on the role of Aer Lingus provider, it is important that it is given assistance to upgrade its planes to pressured cabins because the quality of travel in non-pressurised cabins is considerably different.</P>
    <P>Regarding the long-term viability of the regional airports, it is important to remember and draw attention to the detailed report put forward by Deputy Seamus Brennan on a policy for the regional airports in a major speech in Galway before the last election. He stated at length that when in government his party would support regional airports. His speech at that time showed a positive appreciation of the importance of these facilities in terms of modern transport needs and the level of support which is needed if they are to play their part in social and economic development. It is sad that many of the recommendations in his report at that time which would be of significant benefit to the regions, particularly in relation to air traffic control costs and rates, have still to be implemented. The regional airports are paying high rates at present. They have received no assistance from the State and air traffic control charges are huge. It is disappointing that none of the recommendations in Deputy Brennan's major policy statement prior to the 1997 election has been implemented.</P>
    <P>I hope the importance of regional air transport facilities will be highlighted further. The Bill does not deal with these issues but it is clearly evident at present that there is a huge lack of investment in regional airports. They are operated in co-operation with the local authority and receive only a subvention grant from the State. Given that we are talking about providing a service and <Col N="932" /> developing the BMW regions, the 13 counties, including Donegal and Sligo airports, it is very disappointing that there is no mention in the development plan of airports or where the development will take place.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Minister on the issue of Sligo airport which offers a token service. Before the flotation of Aer Lingus, the Minister should ensure that the major carrier in the country fulfils its initial obligation to develop the regions. I believe it is offloading its responsibilities and pulling out of all the regional airports. There was a big debate this week when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that Aer Lingus would not be pulling out of Kerry Airport. That is a result of political pressure. However, it has pulled out of Sligo and Donegal airports and the service is now being provided by Aer Arann which is a competent carrier. The State is getting off extremely lightly because it is not providing a sufficient subvention to maintain the grants. Sligo Airport needs huge investment for infrastructural development. It has to buy a new fire engine which will cost in excess of £100,000 and there is no guarantee that the Government will provide that funding.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful in relation to the flotation of Aer Lingus following the huge damage to the novice investor in Eircom. People will not be as gullible on this occasion having been burnt so badly previously by the huge fanfare announcement. Aer Lingus is pre-empting this by offloading casualties. When the Aer Lingus prospectus is promoted the company will not carry any liabilities.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on all of us to ensure the State invests in the regions. The Government has failed dismally. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, stated in 1997 that in Government Fianna Fáil would revitalise regional airports but this has not happened. Why has this not happened? Deputy Brennan made a speech in Galway where he said that he would invest in regional airports, provide rates remission and greatly reduce air traffic control costs and that there would be a better service.</P>
    <P>Sligo has only a token service. Business people need more than one morning and late night return service. Knock International Airport, which was the brainchild of Monsignor Horan, was a brilliant concept but, unfortunately, it has been little developed. The western corridor should be developed to attract people into the west. Knock International Airport can cater for jumbo jets but only one lands every second day. There is traffic congestion on our roads and major problems at Dublin Airport. Why not divert a large number of flights to Knock Airport? People from the midlands use the airport.</P>
    <P>The debate has centred on the 14 million people passing through Dublin Airport annually. There is an international airport in the west which is breaking even but it has capacity to take more aeroplanes. There would be no traffic control problems as aeroplanes would not be landing <Col N="933" /> every five minutes. This reflects bad management and the debate about developing a second international airport, as Deputy Ring correctly pointed out, is similar to the economics of duplication. I have a colleague who will promote the concept but with regard to the duplication of investment, one must maintain what one has. If one has two cars, one needs two sets of tyres. If a swimming pool is provided it must be maintained. Sadly, the Government has dismally failed to invest in Knock Airport and regional airports in general. Its record on such investment has been a sheer disaster.</P>
    <P>Billions of pounds will be spent in the national development plan but there is little encouragement in terms of the growth of regional airports. There is no reason people could not fly directly from Sligo Airport in a pressurised cabin rather than from Dublin. There is a token feeder service into an already choked system. Aer Lingus has walked away from that contract and the small aeroplanes which were used to service it will originate from Dublin, adding to the chaos that exists.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses landing charges and so on. However, it facilitates Aer Lingus to produce a glossy prospectus as it approaches flotation. The 500,000 people who were caught by the Eircom flotation will not be easily fooled on this occasion as they will not be novices. It is sad the Government deems it necessary to hive off regional airports with little or no investment. The Government should at least provide major subvention to such airports so that they can offer a service to which people in the regions are justly entitled.</P>
    <P>Knock International Airport is a massive facility. It is a downright disgrace that the tax zone designated at the airport has not been fully utilised. There is no major investment there. If it were not for the airport's board it would not be viable. The Government has failed regional airports, especially Knock International Airport.</P>

      <P>I represent Dublin South-West, which includes the Baldonnel area. A number of my Labour Party colleagues have contributed to this debate, including our spokesperson, Deputy Stagg. I do not have expertise in terms of the general purview of the Bill and I do not purport to follow the wider argument. However, I am dismayed that it is impossible to drag out of the Minister why section 46 has been included. It relates to removing the legal impediment in terms of military aerodromes being freed for commercial or civil activity. It is impossible to find out from the Minister why it has intruded into the legislation. There is a huge campaign demonstrating enormous concern in my constituency about its implications and where it is going. I wish to focus on this narrow area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has a wider significance in terms of the <Col N="934" /> manifest commercial, strategic, economic, industrial importance of Ireland's airport infrastructure. I am concerned at the contributions of Deputies Ring, Perry and others regarding the future of Knock International Airport. It is extraordinary that its potential in terms of attracting industry to its immediate environs has not been exploited and nobody is managing it from the point of view of the Government or politically driving it or seeking to attract the industries that surround every international airport in the world.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that there is a hands-off approach and when one gets submissions from various interest groups &ndash; I am not sure of their credibility &ndash; advocating the creation of a new city in the west one wonders about it when we cannot seem to attract the industries which ought to be easily attractable to an airport such as Knock because one of the primary concerns of international mobile capital is that it has access to an airport. It is a pity nobody is promoting and driving Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>One wonders about the Government's approach to Baldonnel because aside from section 46, South Dublin County Council recently decided to give planning approval for Eircom Park at Tallaght. There was an extraordinary intervention into that debate by the Department of Defence. It decided to review air safety procedures and to lodge an objection to the planning application based on what it called &ldquo;inner horizontal zones&rdquo;. This intrusion, if it were implemented, would mean the lowering of the Naas Road in certain areas and the knocking of Rathcoole and Saggart. It is virtually an absolute veto on further development of any height in the area.</P>
    <P>I take it as a cynical intervention with the Department of Defence being manipulated by the Department of the Taoiseach to facilitate the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; proposal at Abbotstown. A sporting organisation wants to build its own stadium and all it is seeking is planning permission to do so. However, the Taoiseach of the day says, &ldquo;No, you must not do that, you must come on board with my monument in Abbotstown&rdquo;, which the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation told the committee recently would cost £550 million. Imagine what that sum could do for all the athletic, football and other sporting clubs around the country. It is now costing £550 million according to the Minister for sport and fun. It seems the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; will turn out like Mr. Tony Blair's dome. It has similar potential. At a time when a rapprochement is in prospect between Croke Park and the rugby authorities, I cannot see how this city of one million people, and a country of 3.5 million, will support the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. That is a discussion for another day, however.</P>
    <P>On the issue of section 46, there has been widespread concern for some time in the area I represent about the civilianisation of Baldonnel. There was considerable agitation and concern following the intervention by my constituency colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on the last <Col N="935" /> occasion this matter was discussed here. I will quote from a major document which I would like to have time to put on the record of the House, although I do not. It is from the Baldonnel liaison group which states:</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister for Public Enterprise in presenting her Bill gave up much of her time to allow her nephew, Deputy Conor Lenihan, T.D., who represents the constituency surrounding Baldonnel, to make a strong speech supporting the proposed changes to Baldonnel military aerodrome, is especially enlightening and clearly an expression of views on local people's concerns.</P>
    <P>I read Deputy Conor Lenihan's text afterwards. He apparently made a strong speech supporting the removal of this impediment which will allow the civilianisation of Baldonnel aerodrome and its ultimate development as a major alternative airport to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would agree that in an ideal world there would be, in industrial terms, a good argument for that because west Dublin is a major hub of industry. Indeed, at one time I was minded to contemplate the prospect of some private aircraft landing there, if it were economically feasible. However, it is not an ideal world. The flight path into Baldonnel covers one of the most densely populated areas in the country. I do not think the Government appreciates the widespread concern that is being raised by various residents' associations and other groups campaigning against this proposal. For example, in a document I received recently the residents' associations concerned drew my attention to the implications such a development would have for Tallaght, Fortunestown, Springfield, Belgard, Jobstown, Killenarden, Watergate, West Park, Tymon North, Mayberry, Millbrook Lawns, Old Bawn, Rathcoole, Saggart, Newcastle, Clondalkin, Firhouse and Templeogue, areas which are all in my constituency. It will have greater and more acute implications for some of these areas than others. There is genuine concern about the manner in which this is being handled by the Government and the fact that the Government will not come clean to say what is the purpose of section 46.</P>
    <P>Earlier I saw on the monitor the exchanges between my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, and the Minister. He could not extract from the Minister what she intends this provision for. She will not admit that its purpose is to facilitate the civilianisation of Baldonnel. It is not acceptable that we are back in this House after all the tribunals and all the experience we have garnered in recent years to find ourselves considering legislation the purpose of which is obscure, or which is being deliberately concealed by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>I recall a Bill before this House to raise the limit for export credit insurance to £500 million without knowing that its purpose was to facilitate one particular operator for one particular product. That was a major Bill with the most signifi<Col N="936" /> cant ramifications but the sponsoring Minister never told us that its purpose was just to facilitate Goodman.</P>
    <P>We are now discussing legislation but we cannot find out from the Minister why she is removing this statutory impediment or what its purpose is. Is consideration being given to changing the position set out by her predecessor on 24 January 1996? On that date he dealt with the economics of having two airports for Dublin. He said:</P>
    <P>Two airports for Dublin would duplicate infrastructure and facilities. The entry costs of adopting Baldonnel would be high. Airlines could well be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of the inability to offer an integrated service and the absence of the hubbing opportunities that are available through Dublin airport. The coming on stream of the Baldonnel project would coincide with the planned abolition of intra-EU duty free sales from 1999 and will have adverse implications for all airports.</P>
    <P>In other words, the economics of Baldonnel would be problematic from the outset. That was the position then. If that position has changed there is an obligation on the Government to tell the House that it has changed. Let us have a discussion in the local community with people who have genuine concerns about public safety in particular. There are other issues of noise and pollution also. Let us have an open and honest discussion about them rather than trying to bring in this by subterfuge and then down the road advancing it a step further. Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, will have gone and she will have left the people of my constituency like the Eircom shareholders, feeling very cheated.</P>

      <P>I note in her speech the Minister said the Bill's primary purpose is to establish a new regulatory body to be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which will carry out the regulation of charges levied at Irish airports, both by Aer Rianta and those levied by the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of services rendered to aircraft for take-off and approach. Like Deputy Rabbitte, I do not know what else the Minister is trying to achieve by this Bill. I cannot figure out exactly what is going on. I will use the time remaining to me, however, to make the case for my own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the debate that investment for regional airports is not forthcoming from the Government. In the Connacht scenario there seems to be no commitment from the Government to investment in Knock international airport. I do not know what the Government's thinking is in this regard. Perhaps it is a deliberate policy of the Government to await other development options in the Connacht region. As the area I represent, Galway city, is the capital of Connacht, there is no justifiable reason why full-scale airport services should not be available in that area. Galway is believed to be the fastest growing <Col N="937" /> city in western Europe. It is the capital of the west and in the past 20 years the population has increased threefold. Employment is expanding in the city and Galway itself is expanding. There is a genuine case for the development of airports in that area and that debate is currently taking place. The waters have been muddied slightly by the fact that the Ministers who represent the area are not of one mind with regard to the direction that should be taken. I support the case made by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, for the creation of a new airport at Oranmore.</P>
    <P>Galway is unique in that no other city in Ireland has up to 700 acres of land in public ownership in close proximity to the city. This amount is far in excess of what is required for a full international airport. During the summer, Galway Corporation, of which I am a member, made a decision on a proposal put forward by the city manager. The corporation owns 80 acres of land in Oranmore which are adjacent to the 500 acres owned by the Department of Defence. Galway Corporation agreed to make its 80 acres of land available for airport facilities in Oranmore.</P>
    <P>There is a small regional airport in Carnmore and Galway Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which developed the airport and manage it, brought the facility as far as it could. They are now restricted by land and other matters and they cannot take on the responsibility of developing a full-size airport at Oranmore. However, there are people in Galway who will take on that responsibility. I am encouraged by recent replies I received to parliamentary questions from the Minister concerned and the Minister for Defence about the possible availability of the land at Oranmore. The Department of Defence said in a reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year that it is actively considering the idea of relocating from Oranmore. It has a firing range on its lands there, but, according to the Minister, it is actively considering relocating from Oranmore. This would leave the 500 acres available for a full-size airport for Galway.</P>
    <P>Oranmore is a unique location from the point of view of the availability of the site. It is also unique in that it is located on the eastern side of Galway city and would serve Galway city and the surrounding area and counties adequately. It is serviced by first class national primary routes and it is also unique from the point of view of an airport in that it is serviced by the railway.</P>
    <P>Many international companies are located in Galway and employ a large number of people. The management of these companies, which in the main are American, are looking for full airport facilities in Galway. This would enable them to fly directly to their businesses. The development of full international airport services in Galway is almost essential from that point of view.</P>
    <P>An airport would also help to open up Galway and the west to tourism development. One would be in close proximity to the Burren, Connemara and Galway city. There are fine international golf courses within five or six miles of the proposed <Col N="938" /> site for an airport in Oranmore. It would open up a whole new tourism industry for Galway in addition to the benefits it would create in terms of the maintenance of services for existing industries. Many of the Galway based American companies produce high-tech health care products. These must be transported in the shortest possible time to their destinations.</P>
    <P>I want the Ministers in Galway to sort themselves out and to all support the one project. I also want the Minister to outline her plans with regard to facilitating or supporting the idea of full airport services in Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Fine Gael Party will not oppose the Bill, but I have great doubts about the thrust of the legislation. It will establish a commission that will have the power to collect funds. It will transfer an onus from Aer Rianta to a more independent body, but I am not sure that is the most valuable or useful work an aviation authority could do.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem in Ireland is that there is no clear aviation policy. No one has developed a proper policy. When the Minister decided to introduce this Bill, I thought its powers in section 7 would encompass much more than they do. I listened to the contributions of Deputies on all sides about the need to provide airports in their constituencies or region. However, there is an economic limit to the establishment of airports. As it stands, I doubt that Shannon Airport is viable. It was the main international airport established by Seán Lemass when he was Minister, on poor land at Shannon. He gave it particular protection through sole transatlantic status and that worked well in economic terms for the region. It also worked well for Aer Lingus, the national airline.</P>
      <P>Since then, life has grown enormously. Economic activity is at a frenzy and the volume of movement of goods and people has increased greatly. The result is greater demand for air transport. The problem in Ireland, however, is not the airports themselves but access to them. If the Minister was serious about an aviation policy, the new commission would develop such a policy on a continual basis for the future rather than being committed to aviation regulation.</P>
      <P>The aviation industry changes rapidly. There have been a number of serious accidents recently, including the incident where a supersonic aircraft came down. It had 30 years of service but its safety has been called into question. There are many different aspects to aviation policy that should be developed in Ireland and I regret the Minister has not taken the opportunity to address this area in the Bill, which is limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer to my constituency and Shannon Airport. Shannon Airport has suffered immensely as a result of the change in its transatlantic status. The number of tourists from the USA who disembarked at Shannon Airport was substantial. They kept many people in employ<Col N="939" /> ment in the west because they spent as many as four or five days in Killarney and the south or in Connemara, Donegal and the north-west. However, the change has meant that most Americans arriving in Dublin spend a day there and then take a day tour to Killarney before returning. This is an economic loss for the country. The previous system worked effectively and was an economic guarantee for the west.</P>
    <P>Added to that difficulty is that the National Roads Authority must meet certain criteria to determine which national primary or secondary roads it will develop. It says it is bound by economic criteria laid down by the EU Commission. If our Ministers &ndash; it must have been Fianna Fáil Ministers &ndash; agreed to that system of infrastructural development, particularly for our roads, with the EU Commission they were wrong.</P>
    <P>The force of development is like a wheel in that every spoke leads into Dublin. I was not aware that people are afraid of the Baldonnel development. However, it seems the Minister will surreptitiously assist in the development of Baldonnel airport, despite the objections of the people living beside it.</P>
    <P>However, I am more concerned about Shannon Airport. It is a fine, safe and accessible airport. Deputy Lowry was the first Minister to invest in Shannon in 25 years. The new building there is a credit to the airport. We need new ideas and people with greater initiatives to take up the challenge and redevelop Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>As regards the expansion of the aviation industry, we should limit ourselves to our economic strengths. Limerick and the mid-west, for example, are not able to support Shannon Airport economically. If the Bill increases charges, will the charges imposed on Shannon Airport be kept separate? Will the Minister give instructions to the commission about when these airport charges will be imposed? Will a portion of the overhead from the conglomerate in Dublin Airport, where huge numbers of people are employed, be used to keep Dublin aviation going? That will add to the charges. As far as the history of airport development and aviation is concerned, Shannon Airport made a major financial contribution to the ongoing costs of Dublin Airport when it could not meet them.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have a flippant approach to aviation. I am disappointed the Minister is not in the House because I wanted to challenge her about a comment she made, although I do not know if it is true. A meeting was held some time ago in Shannon because Ryanair wanted to fly into Shannon and it put pressure on the Minister to give it special concessions. A number of people made contributions but the Minister or her representative did not attend the meeting, although they were invited by Shannon Chamber of Commerce, which is an independent body. The Minister made inquiries about the meeting and she was told by someone in the Clare area that the same grouses were at it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Members on all sides of the House, irrespective of political persuasion, have long been concerned about the continued viability of Shannon Airport. The Minister has visited it periodically and has tried to ensure employees that everything is rosy in the garden. However, if everything is rosy and up to scratch, why is there a disproportionate rate of growth in traffic and passenger numbers at Shannon? If the Minister's policy was working, surely the increase in passenger numbers at Shannon would be the same as those at Dublin Airport? As I outlined earlier, the services are available and there is easy access to it. Passengers must travel miles of corridors in Dublin Airport. People are running hither and thither and doors have signs apologising for the renovations.</P>
    <P>Surely the Aviation Regulation Bill should require Aer Rianta, which is providing a public service, to plan properly rather than allowing it to hit and miss? Why is it not included in the functions of the commission that it should supervise what is happening at the airports? Who will supply the information about these charges to the commission? Will it be like the health boards, for example, which got money to help severely handicapped people this year, yet up to 70% of it was spent on administration? The Minister for Health and Children thought he was great when he announced he was giving £4 million to the unfortunate handicapped people. Yet less than £600,000 of that is given directly to handicapped people. The same will be the case with the commission. There is no evidence of any structure or accountability in the Bill. It is a slobber from the Minister. I do not expect anything else from her because that is all she does.</P>
    <P>I hope our spokesperson will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage. Apart from making fleeting public relations visits to my constituency and to Shannon Airport, I ask the Minister to announce the expansion of the role of the Irish Aviation Authority, the aviation regulator and the commission and to formulate a national policy so that people can make a contribution to the future of aviation. I know people in Shannon Airport are committed to the promotion of Shannon. If further substantial growth does not take place, I do not know how they will be able to meet all their commitments.</P>

    <P Just="Center">conscious that rising prices have cancelled the benefit of the 5.5% pay increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, have wiped out the 5.5% increase in social <Col N="941" /> welfare payments announced in the budget and reduced the standard of living of persons on fixed incomes;</P>

    <P Just="Center">alarmed by the impact of rising oil prices on the cost base of the economy;</P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns the failure of the Government to anticipate the inflationary pressures or take any real measures to combat inflation, and calls for the introduction of non-inflationary gain-sharing mechanisms, and a coherent strategy to reduce Ireland's exposure to external shocks whether through foreign exchange markets or through energy dependence.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>I am glad to make a brief contribution to this timely and critically important motion from our Fine Gael colleagues. This morning, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, our party leader, demanded a new social welfare Bill to deal with the urgent plight of 880,758 fellow citizens and their dependants who are primarily supported by social welfare assistance and benefits. This repeats calls by the Labour Party since April last. On 15 June, for example, in an Adjournment debate I asked for a finance (No. 2) Bill and a new social welfare Bill. When the awful consumer price index figure of 6.2% emerged in mid-August I, with my col<Col N="942" /> league, Deputy McDowell, called for the return of Dáil Éireann and I demanded a special meeting of the Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs. At the subsequent meeting of the committee in September, I asked for an urgent inflation compensation package for people on fixed incomes to become effective on 1 January at the latest. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, responded in his usual Sphinx-like, unconcerned and even amused way. While supporting this motion on behalf of the Labour Party, I repeat our call for an emergency social welfare package to become effective as soon as possible to show solidarity with our most vulnerable citizens.</P>
      <P>The year 2000 has been a total disaster for social welfare recipients. A Government in the late 1920s was rightly remembered for cutting old age pensions. When this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is defeated in the forthcoming general election, as it certainly will be, it will always be remembered as the Government which slashed social welfare in real terms at a time of unprecedented growth rates of up to 13% per annum.</P>
      <P>For nearly six months, the monthly annualised CPI rate has been running above 5.2% and is now heading for 7% or more. In the same period, social welfare incomes have risen by only 5.2% to 5.7%. Even to the most blasé Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, it is now clear that social welfare rates have been seriously cut in real terms by up to 3%. In April, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, confidently predicted that inflation would taper off this year at 3%. Like so many of his pronouncements, that prediction is now in tatters and the 1.5 million citizens for whose income the Minister is primarily responsible have completely lost confidence in his administration of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>A striking feature of the recent summer of discontent in Fianna Fáil was the way in which a large number of backbenchers disowned the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. As this year has progressed, his credibility has been more and more eroded, particularly in relation to his treatment of people on social welfare. His general increase of £4 last year has been effectively wiped out.</P>
      <P>The basic social welfare rates and assistance of £77.50 and £47.50 per week are deplorable sums for adult citizens and their dependants to be expected to live on. It is now past time for the Government to come forward with an emergency social welfare package, or at least to consider the introduction of that package on 1 January 2001. It should not put it off until April, but should bring forward the reform of next year to this year. I commend the motion and our Fine Gael colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal in the House for this portion of the debate. I <Col N="943" /> remind him that when he took office, the average price of a new house in this country was just over £73,000. The average price on the last day for which figures are available was £131,821, an increase of 79%. The average price of a new house in Dublin when he took office was £84,000 and the average price of a new house in Dublin now is almost £178,000, an increase of 112%. The average price of a second-hand house when he took office was £72,000 and the average price of a second-hand house now is almost £150,000, an increase of 107%.</P>
      <P>House prices do not form part of the consumer price index but the increase in house prices has driven up the levels of mortgages that people have to pay, the increase in house prices has driven up the levels of rent that tenants in the private rented sector have to pay and the increases in the levels of rent in the private rented sector have at least mirrored the increases in house prices. On the basis of evidence produced by the auctioneers and valuers and on the basis of the information available to me, the level of increases in rents has been in excess of that in house prices.</P>
      <P>I was extremely disappointed to hear the Taoiseach yesterday and today effectively telling this House that the promise the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal implicitly made, that there would be legislation to protect tenants in the private rented sector, will not be met. Apparently the report of the commission on the private rented sector has been referred to the housing forum. We have had one committee dealing with the problems of tenants in the private rented sector for over a year and when it reports, the Government's response is to refer it to another committee instead of legislating to deal with the problem and tackle this aspect of the housing crisis.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, who is in the Chamber, to tell us now or at some point, if he proposes to intervene in the debate, what has happened the commitment that he made publicly in July when he published the report of the commission on the private rented sector and said that he would be making proposals to Government in September. Did he make the proposals to Government? Did the Government reject them? Why is the Government kicking to touch the report of the commission on the private rented sector at a time when tenants are paying record levels of rent and when those levels of rent are contributing so much to the problem of inflation, which is the subject of this motion tonight?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems causing the <Col N="944" /> rise in inflation is that many people have much more money to spend on goods and services. I accept that house prices, wage and fuel costs, consumer products and services are increasing inflation. All of us in this House are concerned about the rise in inflation and that it was forecast it would be 3%. We now have to accept it is 6.2% as of last month. Due to the success of our economy we have become a consumer driven nation. The Irish punt is currently trading at 0.76p to the pound sterling and the dollar is trading at IR£1.11. Not long ago we were on a par with sterling and the punt was trading at $1.60.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are locked into the euro is not helping inflation. Currently the punt is worth 0.78 euros. Lack of confidence in the euro and the fact that countries like the United Kingdom and Denmark have opted to remain outside the euro zone is not helping matters. I am confident that the euro will survive in the long-term. The euro has weakened against the dollar. Our inflation rate has risen significantly as a result of high prices and fuel is just one of the areas affected. By joining the euro currency we effectively transferred control to the European Central Bank. We cannot control our interest rates. In the past we could put up interest rates to control inflation and to stop spending.</P>
      <P>I suggest one line of thought which may help reduce inflation and the high cost of consumer goods. All importers of goods, myself included as I am an importer, should buy more in the euro zone where the currencies are locked together and the weakness of the euro would not affect inflation. I was speaking to Mary Hanley of the external trade section of the Central Statistics Office today and I was amazed to hear that our imports from the UK and the USA have increased by 21% and 18% from January to June of this year on the same period last year. Last year we imported £6.6 billion of goods from the euro zone compared to £27 billion from the rest of the world. That is a huge imbalance and is one of the reasons inflation is being forced up. We are buying goods in pounds sterling and in dollars and our euro currency is not strong enough to offset the imbalances.</P>
      <P>This year to the end of June, for example, we imported £4.3 billion from the euro zone and £16.2 billion from the rest of the world. That imbalance is staggering when one considers that £5.9 billion of that was imports from the UK alone. That was for the first six months of the year, which represents an increase of 21% on 1999. A total of £3 billion of that came from the US. I appeal to all importers seriously to examine their buying strategies to ensure they buy within the euro zone where currencies are not affected by the weakness of the euro. That is not a recipe to tackle all the problems related to inflation, but such a strategy would help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance to compensate pensioners and social welfare recipients in the forthcoming budget for the high inflation experienced this year and to use the predicted £2 billion <Col N="945" /> surplus that will be available to improve the quality of life of our senior citizens, those less well off and workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution on this important issue. As the Minister stated last night, the inflation challenge is a pressing and serious issue. In its three years in office the Government can be proud of its economic achievements in job creation, management of the public finances and investment programme for the next five and half years. The Minister outlined the Government's policy last night. He stated that its economic policies are designed to ensure all sectors benefit from the fruits of our economic prosperity. I join Deputy O'Flynn in hoping we can look forward to major improvements for pensioners in the forthcoming budget, similar to those implemented in the previous three budgets. I have no doubt that in the next two budgets further improvements in the range of social services will be made by the Government under its policy of social inclusion.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a small industry among economic commentators of trying to talk down the economy but thankfully the economy is structurally strong and is becoming stronger. We should remember the average rate of growth in the economy over the past three years has been 8% compared with an EU average of 2.5% per annum. The general Government balance has increased dramatically, the national debt has fallen and the numbers in work increased by 96,000 in 1999 alone. There are 200,000 more people at work since the Government took office. They are the statistics that matter to the people. One does not need to read a Central Bank report or economic indices to appreciate the growth in the number of jobs available, all one need do is read the job advertisements that span two or three pages in the provincial newspapers, which is a welcome improvement. Another economic indicator is the number of planning applications in the local newspapers.</P>
      <P>There has been great economic activity in areas such as the two counties I and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represent. The people in those counties suffered immeasurably over a period of 30 years owing to the political troubles in that province. That is not to say all our economic difficulties are surmounted &ndash; far from it &ndash; but there have been dramatic improvements. The Government is implementing policies that are bringing about great improvements in the economic and social life of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we need a better range of job opportunities. We need new knowledge based industries in rural Ireland, particularly in the north east, the north west and in the six southern Border countries. I am particularly concerned about the needs of my constitutency. I appeal to the Government to continue <Col N="946" /> its policy of ensuring we attract inward investment to the Border region and my constitutency.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways to ease pressure in the demand for housing and infrastructural improvements witnessed on the east coast is a strong regionalisation policy. The parties in Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, are the only two political parties that had the courage to implement a policy of regionalisation, regionalising the country and retaining Objective One status for the Border region, the midlands and the west. That will achieve economic activity that would not otherwise come to us. By bringing economic activity and jobs to rural Ireland we will ease the demand for housing and infrastructural improvements on the east coast.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's policy on infrastructural development in our towns and villages in recent years which facilitated the provision of housing, thereby maintaining the population in rural areas. That policy is effective and can be given extra momentum. Every town and village should have the best possible infrastructure within reason to facilitate the provision of housing, ensuring people can live in rural areas and commute some distance to work.</P>
    <P>There was considerable media coverage in recent weeks of fuel and energy prices. It is welcome that the Government did not increase excise duty on unleaded petrol or diesel in the last three budgets. In the past people in the Border region witnessed the outflow of money to the North when motorists crossed the Border to buy petrol and diesel. Speaking from a narrow parochial viewpoint, it is welcome that the traffic is now reversed and northern hauliers and motorists are buying fuel south of the Border. That contrasts with the position some years ago when there were no fuel stations in large tracts of the Border area. The position is now reversed with new fuel stations opening on the southern side of the Border and stations closing on the northern side.</P>
    <P>The £41,000 million available under the national development plan over the next five and a half years could change the face of rural Ireland. It could ensure that necessary infrastructure for this century is put in place to attract jobs to rural areas and thereby ensure a more even spread of population and job opportunities which would have positive social effect.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support the amendment tabled by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is not often one gets the opportunity to enter a fulsome defence of the Government's record on the management of the economy. It is a source of great pride to me that I have the opportunity to defend the record of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who has played an outstanding part in developing and stewarding this economy to its current level of <Col N="947" /> success. I am also proud that I was one of the few members of my party and perhaps in the House who bothered to defend last year's budget when the Minister came under sustained attack. He was right to introduce innovative moves towards tax individualisation. We need more of the same in the years ahead and in particular in the two budgets the Government intends to introduce before going to the people some time after March 2002.</P>
      <P>It is the objective of the Government to continue in office until 2002 and implement the solemn promise it gave the electorate on tax reform. That is the core objective of the common policy Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats put before the people in the last election. There were other objectives including a zero tolerance policy on crime and aspects regarding the peace process, but the Government's core mission statement was to reduce tax rates to 20% and 40%. That is something we will achieve within the lifetime of the Government. The Minister should take a bow for his singular determination to achieve that objective. One would expect criticism of our policies from the Opposition but some leading figures internationally and on the domestic stage, quite apart from the Opposition, have queried the Government's policy of continuing to reduce taxes.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we continue to cut taxes, not least because of the inflation problem that surfaced in the past 12 months but also to maintain the partnership process in which we are engaged through centralised pay bargaining. It is important for the rights of the middle to low paid that they see something in the next two budgets in terms of tax cuts and raising the thresholds. Deputy McDowell will agree with me and with SIPTU that anybody earning £10,000 should not pay tax. That is eminently achievable and the question that now arises is whether we try to do that in this budget, the next one or in both.</P>

      <P>We will not wait; we will implement. The &ldquo;nay&rdquo; sayers in the Opposition, the Central Bank and the ESRI are utterly wrong in their interpretation of what is needed. Many Opposition Members are trying to blame the Minister or the Government for the increase in inflation, but I know Deputy Dukes, if he were true to his profession as an economist, would acknowledge that 70% of the acceleration of inflation that was experienced in the past year was down to three factors: one related to the excise duty placed on tobacco in the last budget, one was the 2% rise in European interest rates and the other was the increase in global energy <Col N="948" /> prices, given that the price of a barrel of oil is now approximately $33.</P>

      <P>These three factors account for 70% of the increase in our inflation. How can we protect ordinary workers on low wages who are vulnerable to price rises, from increases due to inflation? How can we protect those people in a way that is non-inflationary and which does not put us into a further wage price spiral? That is the Minister's objective and I do not doubt he will rise to the challenge. I welcome the Tánaiste saying recently that she intends to continue with the policy of cutting taxes; it is good to see she is not for turning on that, nor am I. We must push ahead with that plan.</P>

      <P>The outlook for oil prices is the only fly in the ointment. If one takes a two year view of the oil market one could see prices declining. An odd aspect of this is that in the next six months we may be prey to higher oil prices by dint of the weather. If there is a bad winter in the US or Europe we may see an increased surge in demand for oil, lifting the price and causing huge problems. However, the weather is something nobody, least of all in this House, has any control over.</P>

      <P>The capacity of the worldwide oil industry has not caught up with demand. Many wells were capped at $10 a barrel and they cannot be brought back into production quickly &ndash; there is a time lag between production meeting demand. If one takes a two year view, however, production will meet demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with our economy. It is probably one of the most competitive economies in the world and recently the extraordinary figure <Col N="949" /> of 25,000 people in long-term unemployment was produced. That is an extraordinary statistic which, for obvious reasons, the Opposition is not keen to tell the public, but it is a real figure which exemplifies the success the Government has had with unemployment. We are effectively operating as a country at full capacity, with 4% unemployment. By most economic reckoning that is full employment or as close to full unemployment as one can get. During the 1980s there were similar or lower figures under Ronald Reagan in America, but those were extraordinary even in the view of American analysts.</P>
    <P>By any yardstick this Government has performed excellently. The budget has some key objectives, one of which is to ensure that low and middle earners gain and are not hit disproportionately by inflation. The wrongs visited on middle to low income workers must be addressed. To be fair, that has been a key objective for Opposition parties for some years and there is broad consensus on achieving justice in the tax system and equity for the middle and low paid.</P>
    <P>The euro's difficulties account directly for approximately 1% of inflation according to some experts, but there was very little the Government could do to arrest its decline in the past 12 months. We saw one central problem with the euro when Mr. Duisenberg came to Ireland some months back. He made a speech which wrongly analysed the problems besetting the economy and suggested we should not go ahead with tax cuts. That is utterly flawed and in some ways it shows why the euro is perceived in the marketplace as being not very well co-ordinated as an operation. There is clear evidence from the market and its observers that the Governor of the European Central Bank is going to European capitals, speaking sometimes in broken English and saying different things at different times in different places. That is getting to the market, which sees an element of confusion in communications from the bank. That is a serious problem which the bank must urgently address.</P>

      <P>Mr. Kissinger famously remarked that he never knew who to ring when he wanted to speak to someone who ran Europe and that is a problem with the European Central Bank; nobody knows who Mr. Europe is. I hope the bank will clarify that. The intervention of the Federal Reserve and the Japanese central bank has put a floor to the currency and it will go up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ignore the odd voices calling for changes in the Groceries Order. There is no economic data to sustain the view exemplified by Moore McDowell of UCD that it is inhibiting competition and adding to inflation. There is no economic evidence to suggest that removal of the Groceries Order would have any effect on our inflation. Food prices here are very competitive and retail competition, as we know, <Col N="950" /> is excellent. I thank the Opposition for being relatively silent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>In reality, this is the economic issue with which we will deal for the rest of this Dáil session and for the next year or so. The inflation we are now experiencing is an inevitable outcome of our economic development in recent years. It is part of the economic cycle; we are now at that point in the cycle when demand in the economy is very high and the supply of services cannot meet that demand, resulting in an increase in inflationary pressures. We should look at inflation from two angles because we are such an open economy: the external sources and the internal factors. The external sources have been well flagged and identified by many people. The increase in the price of oil from $10 to $30 in the past 18 months is the most noticeable and it has been very significant on a worldwide scale.</P>
      <P>Also, the depreciation of the euro by approximately 20% since its launch has added to inflationary figures, but this applies to other European countries tied into the euro. Unfortunately, this impacts more on Ireland than on other countries because such a large proportion of our trade is with countries outside the euro zone. Approximately one third of our trade is with the UK, one third is with countries tied to the euro and one third is with other countries. As a result, we are more susceptible to changes in the euro than countries whose main trade is with other euro countries. As long as Britain remains outside the euro currency, it will lead to further difficulties in the years ahead and that is something we will have to acknowledge, accept and deal with.</P>
      <P>Interest rates came down to a very low level last year but they have moved up again by 2%. This is feeding into the high level of borrowing in Ireland. Due to the large number of people at work, everybody has a greater capacity to borrow whether for new houses, new cars, foreign holidays and new consumer items. There has been an increase in the general level of borrowing. When there is an increase in the inflation rate and the interest rate, it further compounds the factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those factors to which I have referred are, to a large extent, outside our control. Those internal factors are much more so under our control. One which has been mentioned a lot and which was discussed at length on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year when we were implementing measures approved in the budget is the 50p increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes. That item alone increased the rate of inflation by three quarters of 1%. Everybody knew it would have that effect but agreed that in the interests of public health it should be done. Notwithstanding the difficulties it would cause, there is a strong case for the Government to take further action along those lines again to discourage smoking which is again on the increase among young people. I hope the debate on <Col N="951" /> inflation will not cloud the importance of the public health aspect of that overall debate and that is something to which we will come back in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the service sector has been profiteering to an enormous extent. Most companies' profits have increased significantly recently. We only have to look at the figures from the banks to see the level of the increase in profits. That is adding to the inflation pressures as well. Last April we introduced a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour for the first time in the history of the State. That resulted in a wage increase for everybody who earned below that rate. However, many people in the hairdressing industry, in shops and in the pub and restaurant industry abused the introduction of the minimum wage and used it as an excuse to put up their prices. They said it was because of the wage increase, but I have no hesitation in saying they abused the situation. I am pleased the director of consumer affairs has a new role in price fixing and publicity. That is something on which we will have to concentrate in more detail as time goes by.</P>
    <P>In County Laois, a survey of the price of petrol at the petrol pumps was carried out during the summer months. I will give credit where it is due in that it was carried out by the young members of Fine Gael, and I acknowledge that. It showed that within a ten mile area there was a variation of over 8p per litre for a gallon of petrol. That is a price difference of over 36p per gallon from Mountrath to Portlaoise. There is no economic reason for that. The only difference is that one person decides to charge more than the other. I have no doubt that the person who was selling petrol at the cheapest rate was not doing so at a loss. Obviously, the person who was selling it at the higher rate was making an excessive profit. I do not think people look at prices anymore, they just pull into wherever the service is convenient and purchase their products there. The public has by their actions tolerated a certain level of inflation because of the general improvement in their income.</P>
    <P>Competition is essential and I was pleased to read in yesterday's papers that Eircom announced a 20% reduction in some of their call charges. We have seen the benefit of competition with Ryanair and Aer Lingus. It has increased the volume of traffic, business and tourism into the country.</P>
    <P>Inflation can only be dealt with in the context of social partnership and that is why I hope all the social partners will have an agreed formula in advance of the budget so that we do not have an increase in wage rates to any significant extent and that if there is to be a difficulty because of the inflation rates, it will be made up through tax reductions. It is important to recognise that the standard rate of income tax has been reduced by 4% in the past couple of budgets and the top rate of income tax has also been reduced by 4%. That has put more money in people's pockets and has <Col N="952" /> enabled them to purchase more products, adding to the inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the economy has had a growth rate of an average of 8% compared to a figure in Europe of 2.5% per annum, and that again has shown the strength of the Irish economy. That has been reflected in the past three years in that the paid workforce has increased from 1.5 million to 1.7 million. That means there are 200,000 more people in the workforce now than three years ago who are in a position to borrow money for houses, cars and other products. The volume of house building has not been able to match the increase in the number in the workforce. When demand exceeds supply, there is one, and only one, inevitable outcome &ndash; the price will go up. That is why we are here. We will have to deal with that situation in the months ahead. It will take more than months to bring the situation into a state of equilibrium.</P>
    <P>We will have hard choices to make when dealing with inflation. We have almost full employment. The level of competition in the workforce is not as strong as it would be if there was extra capacity in the economy. If we are to deliver on some aspects of the national development plan and fast-track some of the construction projects that need to be carried out, including housing, we will have to tell the construction industry that more European and foreign construction companies will have to come here to do the work. If we wait around long enough, we will see the price of construction products increase. We need some external competition to ensure the projects are delivered on time. We should introduce a new level of competition into the marketplace, which does not exist because we have almost reached full employment.</P>
    <P>I look forward to income tax reductions in the budget. The Government, as a result of the recent truckers' protest, will do something to alleviate pressure on VAT and excise duties. We will have to watch the profiteering by some businesses which is adding to the inflationary pressures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to Deputy Noonan's timely motion. The core sentiments of this motion are threefold. First, inflation at 5.5% has wiped out the benefit of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with the result that the unions are correctly looking for compensation by way of wage increases, and this will add to inflation. Second, the effect of inflation on the many young couples who are saving to buy their first home now find that their hope and wish to do that has again been pushed further away from them with rising interest rates and inflation Third, the impact of rising oil prices will ultimately have a cost effect on every item of food and service essential for everyday living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> It is widely accepted by every economic adviser as well as in advice from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank that inflation is being fuelled by Government policy and, particularly, by last year's budget. Its failure to act in a constructive way to reduce or even halt current trends is unacceptable. Inflation is twice the Government's projected figure and is close to 6%, three times the rate of our European partners. From an economic point of view, Ireland may be heading into its worst winter for 30 years. Nobody wants this to happen but the omens are there and everybody with the wit or wisdom to see them are taking them seriously except the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The parallels of 1979 are there in many ways for those who remember them. If the echoes of 1979 are to be heard, we must take urgent action to prevent the reoccurrence of the effects of the oil crisis of that year. It had a disastrous effect on industry, employment, emigration and the business world in general. The current oil price increase will start a new spiral of increases in electricity, transport, heating and food costs, all essential to the well-being of people, particularly wage earners and social welfare recipients. Much of the industrial progress of the past decade could be quickly eroded if cost increases destroy our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>People have been warning the Government about inflation for over a year but to no avail. The Minister has not intervened. The Taoiseach states there can be no tax cuts for those at the higher income level in the next budget. This will further encourage the unions to take action. As partners to the PPF they were told there would be a reduction in tax and they will rightly demand compensation.</P>
    <P>How can the Government deny social welfare recipients their entitlements to retain their current purchasing power? This is the most vulnerable group to be affected by inflation. If one adds the doubts about the continuation of the partnership surely there is an urgency which the Minister seems to have ignored.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot continue to ignore inflation at 6.2% when pay increases are at 5.5% and social welfare increases are at 5%. People will be poorer if the Government does not take action. The possibility of house prices even being stabilised by the Government's policy is remote. It has failed to tackle interest rates. Mortgage holders who were lured into buying a house by attractively low interest rates will be seriously affected, having been accustomed to manageable payments. The message is becoming louder and clearer to most people &ndash; inflation is here as a real threat to economic growth and threatens employment, living standards and the basic services on which we depend, but it has been ignored by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan pointed out how pervasive inflation has become and the danger it poses for continued growth in output and living <Col N="954" /> standards. Inflation is raising our cost base and seriously endangering our competitiveness. No sector of the economy is immune. My concern in this debate is with agriculture and the agri-food sector, both of which are of key significance for employment, exports and the overall level of economic activity.</P>
      <P>Total farm incomes will increase this year for reasons which have nothing much to do with the Government. That increase will hardly compensate for reductions in the past two years. Therefore it is disheartening to find that a modest increase in income levels is being eroded by inflation. This problem affects farming families as much as families in any other sector.</P>
      <P>To date the Government has refused to take even the most elementary short-term palliative action to deal with the problem of inflation. Deputy Noonan proposed a reduction in excise duties on fuel long before any sectoral protests. People should clearly know that it is nonsense for the Government to claim that changes in excise duties can only take place at budget time. That is not the case. A reduction in excise duties can be implemented at any time. In addition, there are ways in which reductions in excise duties on fuels can be targeted to benefit the productive sectors of the economy, including agriculture, if the Government so wishes.</P>
      <P>It is also open to the Government to consider applying a regulator to excise duties on fuel to offset the effective increases in oil prices. Let no one on the Government side claim that if we were to do so we, on our own, would bring about a major change in OPEC policy &ndash; we would not do so. If the Government wished, it could immediately set in train a reduction in excise duties on fuels and, by bringing simple legislation before the House, could introduce a system under which we could regulate the tax take on fuels to offset the effects of any further increases in oil prices. Apparently, however, the Government is mesmerised into immobility. It will not even consider such measures until the magic budget day, by which time inflation will be further entrenched and it will be even more difficult to take action to reduce it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also pointed out that inflation is roaring ahead in the services sector which also adversely affects farmers and the food industry. As an interesting sidelight on the culture, or what one might laughingly call the ethos, of Fianna Fáil, it struck me that Deputy Fleming, when speaking about inflation in the services sector, accused people of profiteering. However, when he speaks about inflation in the housing sector and in house prices he talks about the laws of supply and demand. Have things changed at all or has Fianna Fáil any understanding of how the economy works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation is affecting farm incomes in many ways. If that was not enough, the Government is contemplating measures which will further turn the screw on farm incomes by ratcheting up costs. In a shameful and bare-faced piece of bad faith, <Col N="955" /> the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has reneged on a commitment given in this House by the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and is now applying a charge on farmers under the national beef quality assurance scheme. The Minister is now contemplating a new classification of animal vaccines which, if implemented, will reduce competition and, inevitably, increase costs for farmers. I raised this matter on the Adjournment yesterday and the reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, was incomprehensible. I smell trouble ahead when Ministers become evasive. That bodes ill for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>At a time when we see a limited recovery in farm incomes the Government is adding to the effects of inflation by imposing extra costs on farmers. It is incapable of dealing with inflation, it is anti-competitive, anti-farmer, inimical to the food industry and lethal for rural communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has failed the people. It has lost control as inflation grows at a rate which undermines the basis of industrial peace. The partnership which is so important to ensuring that economic development is sustained is under threat. Those on low pay in particular are feeling the bite of inflation and experiencing a fall in living standards.</P>
      <P>The PPF sees this section of the labour market and social welfare recipients left with no prosperity and a lack of fairness. When the agreement was struck there was an expectation of 3% inflation between tax measures and wage increases. This meant an expectation of a real gain of 7% in disposable income. Due to the ineptitude of Government, which obviously has its eye on some other game, that reasonable expectation is lost.</P>
      <P>The Government should have anticipated the problem of the pressures which would push up inflation. The Minister's budget was inflationary. At that time he should have taken measures to counterbalance the effects of his actions. The Government's financial management is of no value to the majority of people in the short or long-term. If it is not in the interest of the majority it must be declared anti-national. It is unacceptable and unrealistic to expect the labour market to stand by while the agreement sees people left 4% short of their expected take home pay. Such people rightly point to others who are reaping a far greater reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young families are particularly badly hit as they are caught in every way and both partners are forced into the labour market. If they are in rented accommodation they are experiencing rent increases as a direct result of the Government's response to the Bacon reports. As these rents rise it reduces the couple's prospect of security and of saving a deposit for a home of their own. Government implements the negative effects of Peter Bacon's report by failing to fast-track the sections which would speed up the final grant of planning <Col N="956" /> permission, thus putting more houses onto the market which, in turn, would reduce the price of houses. Should a couple be fortunate enough to be blessed with children, their problems really commence. Now children become a major problem and a major expense, a cost which further reduces the family's capacity to put together a deposit for a home in which to rear their children. Should they be lucky enough to somehow get the key to a home of their own, they live in fear because of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues. They now worry about the repayments and how they will grow and grow, and they will as long as this Government follows its poor policies.</P>
    <P>As if it is not bad enough that after a couple have struggled to put together a deposit for a home and worked hard to pay a child minder, they are now faced with family members who may be in receipt of social welfare whose living standards are being eroded due to Government's failure to control inflation.</P>
    <P>This Government's failure means people cannot afford to rent an apartment, nor can they get together a deposit for a house. If they have children they must work all hours to pay for child care. They cannot afford to fill their petrol tanks. They cannot even afford to give their old age pensioner mother a few euro to make her social welfare pension last from one end of the week to the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I hear prominent Government backbenchers and Ministers stating that the minimum wage is fuelling inflation I despair for the people and lose all confidence in the Government. The Government is saying that charge hands in supermarkets and helpers in restaurants and bars, the people on the lowest pay, are fuelling inflation. How far removed from reality is this Government that it can assert that the minimum wage is the cause of the increase in the price of services? It is ridiculous and farcical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the Minister some hard facts on inflation which he might take on board. Perhaps then he could tell me what is causing inflation and who is suffering. I visited an elderly couple last week in their home. Their pride and joy in their kitchen was their oil-fired cooker at which they were sitting in their top coats in order to keep warm. In August 1999, having had oil-fired central heating installed, they bought 1,100 litres of heating oil which cost £263. In September last, they sought to buy a refill for which they were quoted £440 for 1,100 litres of heating oil. They thought it was a mistake and clarified it with the oil company who told them that was the price, that the cost of heating oil had increased substantially. That is an understatement. It had gone up by £177. Not having the money they did not get the oil. The company refused to deliver a lesser quantity because it would not be economical to do so. They were encouraged to get this system of heating because it is environmentally friendly, clean, easier to handle than coal or turf, but there they were in their beautiful home, in their beauti<Col N="957" /> ful kitchen living in the cold, all because inflation had affected the cost of home heating oil.</P>
    <P>What is the Government doing about this? It is throwing its hands in the air and ignoring it. That is just one incident I came across and I have no doubt that that is happening all across the country. Young couples are affected in the same way. They were encouraged to get oil-fired central heating in their new homes but now they cannot afford the fuel. If they had a hearth they could at least buy briquettes and have some heating. That is one cold fact of inflation, and the Government is not even aware of it nor is it making any gesture, despite the fact that there is £1.9 billion in excess in returns to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing, something else that affects people, the 20% social housing policy is a nonsense, a cop-out for doing nothing, and it will not work because builders and developers are running away from it. Young couples are fearful of it. Where builders and developers are thinking about it, who is going to pay for it? The cost will be added on to the price young couples have to pay for the homes we are encouraging to get out buy. That is not a policy. It is a cop-out. It is time the Government came up with a realistic housing policy to look after our young people and to encourage our emigrants to come home to work. It is a nonsense, it is farcical and it is not acceptable. People expected that, in a booming economy, they would all be rewarded. There are people who are doing well, but they are in the very top income bracket. The middle and lower income groups are suffering because the Government does not realise the difficulties and problems of ordinary people. I would have thought that Government backbenchers, given that Ministers are so far removed from reality, would have been able to advise them that there is a need to tackle inflation and to tackle it immediately, before the next budget, in order to give some relief or at least to indicate that the Minister for Finance intends to do something. There are no such indications, and people are in despair. It is not good enough. It is not acceptable. The Government should shut up shop and go to the country and let in a party that will rule the country and give fair play to everybody. We have people on this side of the House who are capable of doing that and who are only too anxious to take over the reins of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">

      <P>I wish to draw to the Minister's attention the recent media coverage advocating the abolition of the grocery order as a means of tackling inflation and in particular the publication of erroneous and misleading figures emanating from the Competition Authority. Official figures from the Central Statistics Office show that food prices and grocery orders are not the source of inflation. There has been no difference in inflation rates between grocery orders and non-grocery order items. The CSO figures for the year to June 2000 show overall inflation running at 5.5%. Food inflation, including that for meals in <Col N="958" /> restaurants for this period is just 3.1%. When the meals out category, with inflation of 6.2%, was deleted the cost of supermarket shelf food items had increased by just 2.4%, less than half the overall inflation rate. From the CSO base date of November 1996 to date food prices have increased by 13%, or approximately 3.5% per year. Grocery order items rose by 13.1% and non-grocery order items by 12.9% during the same period. CSO figures confirm this. The actual cause of high inflation is not food but energy, transport, insurance, mortgage repayments and services.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove cigarettes from the price index. This would allow the Government to pursue a public health policy of eliminating smoking in the greater population. The fact that it is included was a primary factor in the inflation rate last year.</P>
      <P>Calls for the abolition of the grocery order also overlook the reality of competitiveness in the Irish retail sector and have more to do with the ambitions of certain new entrants into the retail trade here than with tackling inflation. Irish consumers have three distinct choices in fulfilling their grocery shopping needs. At the lower end of the market are the discounters offering approximately 800 lines, no named brands, no service. They are clearly the cheapest alternative for shoppers who wish to shop in that environment. It is important to emphasise that in the UK market discounters, after ten years, have managed to capture only 3% of the market. This would suggest that discounters have very limited appeal. Second there are the multinationals, Tesco, Dunnes, Superquinn, all large supermarkets run by corporate bodies. They have a 50% share of the Irish market. Third, we have the independent sector, made up of such groups as Supervalu, Centra, Spar, Londis, Mace, Forecourt and the independent shops. The independents currently hold a 47% share of the Irish market. That means that practically one in every two consumers here, by choice, shop in an independent store. There is no other country in Europe where this choice is available to consumers &ndash; the UK is an example &ndash; because the multiples have eliminated that market.</P>
      <P>I would like to impress on the Minister that the minimum wage is very much a minimum. It is not minimum to the employee. It is gross. After taxation it can work out at £3.80. Deputy Noonan has correctly promoted the concept of giving people a minimum net wage. That is what Fine Gael will be promoting in Government. The figure of £4.40, which is gross, is far from that figure.</P>

      <P>If the Government was doing its job, there would be no need for the debate because we would not be dealing with an inflation rate of more than 6%. The effect of this rapid rise in inflation is that it has wiped out any benefits of the 5.5% increase in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. For people on social welfare, <Col N="959" /> some of whom got the 5% increase early while others waited half the year to get it, the fairness is long gone. For many people on social welfare this 5% increase is not real. For example, an old age pensioner or carer in a local authority house received a £4 increase in the budget. About three quarters of that would go on the review of local authority rents and, therefore, in real terms they received an increase of £1. With an inflation rate of 6%, they are about £4 or £5 worse off now than they were at the beginning of the year. Government inaction has reduced this person's pension or carer's allowance by about £4 per week in real terms.</P>
      <P>What about the married couples who the Minister discriminated against in the budget? Those are the couples on lower incomes, that is, those earning less than £28,000. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government looked after the higher earners. Couples earning less than £28,000 are discriminated against whether one stays at home or both work outside the home. There are estimated to be more than 250,000 two income couples.</P>

      <P>As in the past when inflation rose, it is ordinary working people who are blamed. Once again there is hype about wage inflation. The pay increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been wiped out and workers are rightly seeking to maintain their incomes. We hear nothing of the massive profit-taking by corporations, whose tax share has been progressively decreased under this Government.</P>
      <P>The real causes of inflation include systematic profiteering in the property development and house building sector, rising oil prices and the collapse of the euro, which has made imports much more expensive. Then there is the factor which none of the three larger parties in this House is prepared to admit, that is, the surrender to the European Central Bank of control over our own currency. Without the euro the Government could have raised interest rates much more quickly and to much greater effect than the European Central Bank has done. While this would still have led to some price increases, it would have stemmed the currency spiral which has led to so many price increases on imported goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Inflation has wiped out the much vaunted social welfare increases introduced in the last budget. Those dependent on social welfare are worst hit by inflation and the Government must address this as a matter of urgency. Instead of yet another tax bonanza for the highest earners, the Minister for Finance must provide in the next budget the resources to compensate people on social welfare and should target significant moneys at areas which will substantially improve the quality of life for the vast majority of people faced with the inequalities in current health, education, child care and infrastructural spending. I urge a total reappraisal of the Government's policy to address effectively the issue of inflation.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Working people and social welfare recipients have been the subject of a major con trick on the question of wages, living standards and inflation. It should be quite clear to all by now that the so-called partnerships, the deal between Government, bosses and trades unions, are an organised way to keep workers' wages down while every Tom, Dick and Harry in business can profiteer as they will. The Central Statistics Office listed house prices as one of the main reasons for the rise in inflation, with increases in private rents, average mortgage interest payments and local authority service charges. The cost of mortgages rose for one reason, that is, blatant profiteering by landlords, developers and house builders, but at the same time wages were pegged down to ruthless levels by the national wage agreements.</P>
      <P>We have heard the usual chorus over recent weeks by bosses and Government in response to the increase in inflation &ndash; no change to the wage agreement, workers must not get compensation. In other words what they are saying is that landlords, racketeers, speculators, profiteers, house builders and the rest of them can carry on regardless, putting up rents and increasing profits at will, but workers may not seek compensation. The law applies in an entirely different way to them in terms of what is trying to be implemented at present. This is not partnership, to call it partnership is laughable. What kind of partners would put a working person out of their home for profit, increase rents to such a degree that they cannot afford them or increase homelessness? It is incredible that the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions would have led their members into this situation, that they would have such touching confidence in employers and Government not even to write a clause into the agreement a few months ago that workers would be compensated for inflation.</P>
      <P>Service charges also are, according to the CSO, a reason for the rise. Indeed, refuse tax is becoming a major issue in a number of county council areas around the country, with £150, which is nearly a week's wages for many people, lashed on people, for example, this year in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be given the opportunity to respond to this important debate. As the Minister for Finance said in the House yesterday, the increase in inflation this year is disappointing and it represents a serious problem which we are tackling.</P>
      <P>Our current problems must be seen in the context of our booming economy and the ongoing progress we are making in a number of different areas. The Government has delivered on commitments outlined in the Government programme and we have made progress in a wide range of areas since taking up office. The number in employment has increased by more than 200,000. Living standards for those in employment and those on social welfare have increased in real terms. Unemployment has fallen from almost 10% in 1997 to 4.3%. Consistent poverty has been reduced significantly and a record number of houses have been built.</P>
      <P>The Government has produced the largest investment plan ever seen. Together with strong private investment, this is laying a solid basis for the medium and longer terms. We have reduced taxes in line with the mandate received from the electorate. The standard rate of tax has been reduced by four percentage points and the top rate is also down by four percentage points. We have also increased personal allowances and the standard band, while introducing tax credits and starting the first phase of individualisation. Notwithstanding that, we have turned the public finances around so that our children can look to a future less burdened with debt. We will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made.</P>
      <P>Key elements in the Government's strategy on inflation are to improve competition and tackle supply problems and bottlenecks where they exist. More importantly, the Government is working to ensure that the successful social partnership model remains in place. We are consulting the social partners as part of the process of framing the next budget. We must clearly avoid policies which will push up inflation. Equally we do not intend to withdraw from our electoral and partnership commitments on tax and social expenditure. Notwithstanding the unwelcome increase in inflation, working together we can ensure that the PPF will deliver real improvements in living standards while maintaining competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tackling inflation, all aspects of economic policy regarding taxation, competition and the labour market are being considered. We recognise the need to improve supply in areas such as housing and child care. We have already taken a range of initiatives which are having an impact in these crucial areas. Competition is being encour<Col N="962" /> aged in areas where there are barriers. This Government has always been in favour of more competition. The measures announced in June built on the progress made earlier. Many more houses have been built each year during our stewardship than during the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>Improvements are taking place but clearly we have a long way to go before our infrastructure can meet the needs of our growing population. Dramatic improvements in the short-run are not feasible.</P>
    <P>If the present difficulties were easily foreseen, as seems to be suggested, why did not the previous Administration streamline the planning system, put in place the plans and rezone and service land to build the housing we need? These things were not done and it was left to the present Government to deal with the problems we now have.</P>
    <P>What is the Opposition suggesting we do to alleviate the bottlenecks on the supply side? It suggests we should set up a supply-side task force. I say &ldquo;great&rdquo; and we will have another quango, as seems to be the mantra of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Government has a proud record of achievement. Sustaining economic growth to build on these achievements is our key objective. This is best achieved by tackling inflation within the context of the agreements that already exist. I am confident the Government can continue to deliver. There is no need to take my word on that. The OECD, the IMF and the European Commission all say the same. They anticipate Irish growth of 6% to 7% next year.</P>
    <P>Given the views of these disinterested observers, I commend the Government's counter motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on tabling the motion. The threatened removal of the ban on below cost selling is a major issue for small shopkeepers, small bakeries and those who have been the backbone of the country. I accept that one has to move with the trend of large supermarkets, large shopping centres etc. I come from a background of a country shop. I understand the difficulties and I am aware that many people in smaller shops went to the wall. Those who survived invested in their businesses. The removal of the ban on below cost selling would put many people out of business. The Government has a duty to ensure this does not happen. I have had many contacts from my constituents who are extremely worried. It is vitally important that the Government maintain this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increase in the price of petrol and diesel. I hope the Minister will take this into account in the forthcoming budget. Inflation is going as fast, if not faster, than the Celtic tiger. The people do not know whether it was inflation or the Celtic tiger that passed them on the road. The Government has it within its power to rectify this matter. That is its purpose. It is not there for photo-calls or to open this, that or the other. A man said to me the other night he would not be surprised if some of the senior Ministers were <Col N="963" /> called in to open a tin of beans. No matter where one goes there is a photo-call for one thing or another.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance. It was like an extract from Bulfin's <i>Rambles in Éirinn. </i> What strikes me about the Government is that there is no sense of urgency. One would think the Government was in its first months of office. The Government has forgotten that the clock is ticking and the calendar is moving on and that it is well into its fourth year. As its goes through its fourth year and faces an inevitable election there is no doubt that inflation is the greatest problem facing the economy. The lack of urgency in the Minister's speech last night and the lack of urgency in the Minister of State's speech this evening shows a complacency for the majority of citizens against a background of serious problems which is beyond belief. One would not think we have a housing crisis or that old age pensions, the unemployed and everyone on social welfare will be worse off at the end of the year than at the beginning. Neither would one think those who negotiated 5.5% under the new national wage agreement would be worse off at the end of the year than at the beginning. One would not think that the savings of those on fixed incomes would be eroded month after month. There was no sense of urgency in anything said by either the Minister or the Minister of State. Is it any wonder the Government finds there is <Col N="964" /> increasing dissatisfaction in the electorate. Is it any wonder that the increase in dissatisfaction with the Government was up by almost 10% when last measured by the opinion polls? </P>
      <P>The lack of urgency about the real problems facing the people shows the Government is out of touch. There was an old IDA joke when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce as it was then known. Somebody asked an IDA executive in the United States because of local difficulties in California if there was any word in Ireland which was the same as <i>mañana</i> which was used frequently among the workers coming in from South America to California. The IDA official was stumped and said we did not have anything in Ireland which suggested the same sense of urgency. The Minister's speech reminded me of that. There are numerous problems. Our constituents come to our clinics and list problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet we have a minimalist speech tonight. Without giving offence to anybody in the Minister's Department or to any of his back-up staff it is what we would have called in the old days a &ldquo;Board of Works&rdquo; job. I said to my colleague &ldquo;there is no way this was written by a civil servant. It would not be as bad if it was written by a civil servant&rdquo;. The Minister's speech last night was equally disappointing. He went through the usual ritual defence of Government economic policy as he has done for the past three and half years. Some of the paragraphs came off the word processor intact just as they were run into the record previously. He did not focus on the key to the debate. What is this Administration doing about inflation? Apart from some passing comments about reforming the liquor licensing laws and introducing price controls on drink the week after it had gone up, there was nothing else in the Minister's speech to suggest that the Government is even aware of the problems.</P>
      <P>Many of the Minister's backbench colleagues put up the defence that everything is great because there is a great Government. They went on to say that the ESRI, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the Irish Central Bank are talking nonsense and all the advice from these international experts is part of a loose conspiracy with the Opposition to do down a good Government. It is the same line of argument which urged the Minister for Finance to describe us as &ldquo;left wing pinkos&rdquo; and the Taoiseach to describe us as &ldquo;creeping Jesuses&rdquo;, whatever that might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the quarterly report for the autumn from the Central Bank, the most recent analysis of inflation. If the Minister has not already read it he should take it home for bedtime reading. The report lays down its general concern about inflation. Although I keep a close eye on inflationary trends, I was surprised to see how rapidly things have changed. Last October, the annual rate of inflation in Ireland was 1.5%. By July it had reached 6.2%. Service inflation this time last year was 3.5% but by July it had gone above <Col N="965" /> 7%. The Minister should reflect on the bank's comment that strong domestic inflationary pressures have been reflected in significant acceleration in the rate of inflation in the non-traded section of the economy. On a year on year basis it has increased to 6%.</P>
    <P>The report talks about the elements which constitute the increase. Within the service sector the largest increases over the past year have been recorded in child care, hairdressing, education, training and medical expenses. It goes on to say that administrative service prices, for which the Government is responsible, have increased by 5.9% and the service index has averaged 7.4% in the three months to July.</P>
    <P>Another serious measure of inflation is asset inflation. The most recent statistics from the Department of the Environment and Local Government show that average new house prices increased nationally by 17.2% year on year during the second quarter of 2000, compared with an increase of 12.9% year on year. Instead of the inflation in house prices reducing, it has jumped 5% in the first six months of this year. The statistics quoted by the Central Bank are from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am not making them up. The Minister is suffering from the misapprehension that house prices are reducing. They are not, they are going up again. Deputy Gilmore earlier quoted the price of an average house in Dublin. There has been an astronomical increase in the price of houses in Dublin and throughout the country since the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I have always conceded that some of Ireland's inflation is caused by rising oil prices. I have also always conceded that some of it is caused by the weakness of the euro, particularly due to imports from the United Kingdom. However, prices have risen all over Europe and the euro is weak throughout euroland. Why is our inflation rate running at three times the European average when those countries are subject to the same oil price increases and a weak euro? This is no explanation for our inflation of almost 7%. Looking at the figures comparatively does not explain why our rate is three times higher.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, it is time the Government took this issue seriously. There are a number of aspects of inflation. First there are the root causes. They must be examined and measures must be taken to solve them. Then there are the symptoms of inflation. In one way, the symptoms are all around us. Every time one goes to a shop prices have gone up. When one calls the doctor the fee has gone up. If anybody in one's family looks at a house with a view to purchase, one will see many symptoms of inflation.</P>
    <P>The third aspect which must be addressed is the effects or consequences of inflation. They are manifest. The 5.5% wage increase and the average 5% increase in social welfare announced in the budget have been wiped out, persons on fixed incomes are worse off and people's savings are being eroded. The Minister, obviously living in some type of bunker, told the Opposition we have come up with no solutions. Deputy McDow<Col N="966" /> ell and I offered several suggestions last night for the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>With regard to dealing with the consequences of inflation, the review being engaged in by the social partners is timely. The social partners will have to examine a serious increase in social welfare payments and child benefit to restore what has been lost by the poorest people in our community and to take the many families who have again sunk into poverty out of poverty. They will also have to look at the manner in which the pay award will be applied for the rest of the year and look again at what tax concessions will be made to compensate people who have lost out due to loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister for Finance, in an arrogant fashion, to declare last night that like the Bourbons he has learned nothing and forgotten nothing since the last budget and that he will do the same again. The last budget was a fiasco. On this occasion, the Minister must address low paid people. He must put the bulk of his resources into taking people on the minimum wage out of the tax net. At present, every pound earned after £110 per week is taxed. The minimum wage, according to the projection of the Tánaiste when she introduced it, is moving towards £200 per week. What kind of taxation policy do we have when £90 of the minimum wage is subject to income tax and the Minister claims he has reformed the system? He has reformed it for people on good incomes but he has not reformed it in any way which suggests that fiscal and taxation policy is being used to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister seeks proof of our argument that the people who got the largest increases in the last budget were those who needed it least, he need only look at the inflation figures for agricultural land. Farming has not been great for the past 12 months or so but agricultural land prices, according to the Central Bank, increased by 22.2% on average during 1999 and by 53.4% year on year. That is an increase of 53.4% on the price of agricultural land in a year when farmers were in difficulty.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to measure the effect of his taxation policy he can see it in the price of houses, the price of assets and the price of agricultural land. The policy has been that much gets more and the devil take the hindmost. Reaffirming that he will do the same in the next budget is another recipe for disaster. I will remind the Minister of that should he follow the same foolish path in the next budget that he followed in the past. He must address inflation. Most people will end this year worse off than when the year started. Inflation makes people poorer. At a time when the country was never more prosperous the Minister and his colleagues are making the bulk of its citizens poorer than when the year began.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Job Creation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for accepting the issue of job creation in Inishowen for tonight's Adjournment debate. Many people believe Donegal has been hard hit by the loss of so many jobs in Fruit of the Loom in recent years, and that is so. The most recent announcement of 300 to go in Buncrana between now and the spring is yet another body blow to a peninsula that was already reeling from previous announcements on job losses. However, it is not only Fruit of the Loom that has closed in Inishowen. Last Friday we had the news of yet another factory closure in Carndonagh with the loss of 19 jobs and in the past 18 months we have had a litany of factory closures all over the peninsula, which have also impacted very heavily on the local economy.</P>
      <P>Inishowen is well defined in geographical terms. It has a population of 30,000 which is roughly the same as Leitrim or Louth. It is in many respects a unit not unlike a county. It is an area that is united at peninsular level in a parochial way, so what hits one town in Inishowen hits everyone. The job losses in many factories have hit every household, but some even more than others.</P>
      <P>The task force has come and gone. It issued a comprehensive report and summarised the issues that needed to be addressed. At this point, each Department should be made to give an account of what it has done in response to that report. Have the Departments dusted down their copies since the last time I asked Parliamentary Questions about it? I trust that I will receive that information in due course from the Departments concerned and I will leave that issue in the capable hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Extending our sympathy to those who have lost their jobs is not enough. As a public representative I have met, and continue to meet people who have been made redundant. They have not sat on their hands or wallowed in their own misfortune. They have followed FÁS courses and I sincerely commend the FÁS staff in Donegal who have really been on top of their jobs. Those who were made redundant have gone back to education, often without any help that should have been available to them, because they did not fit neatly into the right category according to the rules. Those rules could not be altered to assist deserving causes. They have tried to better themselves and have succeeded in showing to all that they have the capabilities to be flexible and are willing to adapt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously, we have a hard-working labour resource comprising of people who left school, often at 14 years of age, who have known no life other than a life of work. Those people wish to return to employment and many of them <Col N="970" /> have both enjoyed and been extremely resourceful in rising to the challenge of a new direction. Those people are extremely frustrated, therefore, at the numerous calls for overseas workers that we hear through the media. They are frustrated also every day they turn on their radios and find that there are 600 more jobs for Dublin or 1,000 for Cork, Limerick, Galway or somewhere else that is already saturated with industry. They are frustrated with their new qualifications in computing, for example, because not enough such jobs are being created in Inishowen.</P>
    <P>Approximately 2,000 jobs have been lost. To hear about the creation of four, six, ten or 20 jobs is fine and I look forward to similar announcements in the near future as there are many people in Inishowen who are helping to expand their own endeavours to employ more people, or branch out into a slightly different market and thus create small levels of employment. I commend these efforts but 2,000 jobs have still been lost in the area and it will take many announcements of minor job creation to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>So often, people look to Donegal and say &ldquo;It's so far away. It is so isolated&rdquo;, but this simply is not the case, nor should it be so. What is the mileage from Dublin to Cork, or Dublin to Limerick? What is the mileage to Inishowen? Does it differ very much? Why, therefore, are we &ndash; who are within 20 minutes of a major port and airport, and one and a half hours from an international port and airport &ndash; supposed to be isolated?</P>
    <P>In the post-Good Friday Agreement period, are the IDA and IDB working on a level that has gone beyond being superficial? If so, will the message ever be given to serious investors that for those who need access they have it through Derry or Belfast? I accept that, nationally, access must be addressed. A journey that used to take three and a half hours now takes five. The national development plan talks about reducing &ldquo;absolute journey times&rdquo; and fostering &ldquo;balanced regional development&rdquo; or &ldquo;facilitating continued economic growth&rdquo;. We must, therefore, on merit, be awarded dual carriageway status for the N2 in the national spatial strategy review that is being carried out. We must have the by-passes of Monaghan, Carrickmacross and Castleblaney expedited. We must have Ministers working at a cross-Border level to deal with the A5 and a rail link to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Donegal can no longer be perceived by those in a position to alter our status as some remote island north of the North. We are an integral part of Ulster, we are part of this great Republic and we are now the only source of labour left in the country. The Minister should commit himself, along with the Tánaiste and other Cabinet members, to ensuring that the issue of job creation on the peninsula of Inishowen is addressed on a large scale. We need decentralisation to assist our status and we need a worthwhile large project to be undertaken. We also need State agencies to do more than long-finger the problem or palm us off with small-minded ideas. As a first step, we need factories to be marketed strongly. We need people to accept our <Col N="971" /> Border location as an advantage and not a disadvantage &ndash; a new opportunity for us &ndash; or we will not be taking up the challenge offered to us under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The level of job losses in Inishowen is unprecedented in the country affecting, as it does, so many hundreds of households.Major initiatives and imagination must be employed to resolve the issue. Our feeling is that where there is a will, there is a way. Let it be the Minister's and our motto in Inishowen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Keaveney's concern at the proposed loss of over 300 jobs in County Donegal. The loss of these jobs will be a great disappointment to the people of Inishowen and the surrounding area. I fully appreciate the concerns which the redundant employees and their families are experiencing. However, this has been signalled for some time and it will still leave in excess of the 600 threshold, which was agreed between Fruit of the Loom and the IDA. This agreement must hold until 2005.</P>
      <P>In response to the most immediate job losses at Fruit of the Loom, FÁS intends to hold quality registration interviews with 182 employees over a six day period, beginning on 16 October. Following these interviews, it will carry out a skills analysis of the workforce. This analysis will enable FÁS to organise training courses to suit the needs of the workers or to place them in suitable employment. FÁS will be putting in place a similar programme for employees at CMT, Carndonagh.</P>
      <P>In recognition of current difficulties, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have reorganised their Donegal based services to deal with regional issues, including actions arising from the report of the Donegal Employment Initiative, the task force established by the Tánaiste in 1998 following the announcement of job losses at Fruit of the Loom in County Donegal. The IDA is actively seeking to increase the Objective One region's share of jobs in greenfield projects from the current level of 25% to 50%.</P>
      <P>The closure of Fruit of the Loom's sewing facility will make a high quality premises available in Buncrana for the location of new alternative industry. Previous reductions have not resulted in Fruit of the Loom vacating its premises in Buncrana, which I inspected personally and I know is an excellent and modern facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA is an active participant in the Donegal County Development Board process. A new development strategy for the county is being drawn up at present and the board has agreed to use the Donegal Employment Initiative report as a basis for formulating the strategy. Inishowen is well represented on the board and it is my opinion that Inishowen has many advantages to <Col N="972" /> capitalise on opportunities in our modern economy.</P>
    <P>In particular, the modern high specification facilities which have become available in Buncrana should be the node for new high technology industry in the Inishowen area. With its proximity to Derry Airport, its quality workforce and the educational facilities in Inishowen, I am confident that it would attract modern high-tech industry. It is my wish that the State agencies, in addition to the Donegal Employment Initiative, Donegal County Council, local businesses and community leaders, including people with entrepreneurial flair, should work together to achieve this goal as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In April this year Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Donegal County Enterprise Board, organised a seminar for the clothing and textile industry on the theme The Way Forward. The purpose of the seminar was to outline some new ideas and best practice for the industry. Enterprise Ireland recently articulated a clear regional development mission and will be devoting greater resources to boosting the indigenous sector and the potential for high growth firms.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently undertaking a strategic review of the Irish knitwear industry in conjunction with the Irish Knitwear Exporters' Guild &ndash; IKEG. Its primary objective is to examine the current position of Irish knitters, to assess their capabilities, strengths and weaknesses and to develop a growth strategy. Other initiatives planned to support the clothing industry in County Donegal include the implementation of a Donegal clothing promotion over the next six months in conjunction with Donegal CEB and Údarás na Gaeltachta and the introduction of an e-networking group across Ireland, including Donegal, to facilitate the sharing of information, contacts and ideas. This is due to commence over the next two months.</P>
    <P>Carndonagh, Buncrana and Moville continue to be marketed by Enterprise Ireland as suitable locations for start up and expansion companies. Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with several new and existing companies in County Donegal in relation to possible developments, some of which are at a reasonably advanced stage of negotiation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Keaveney on the forthright case she made on behalf of Inishowen and her constituency. I am confident that the combined efforts of all those involved in implementing the recommendations of the report of the Donegal Employment Initiative will ensure that progress continues in County Donegal in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for discussion on the Adjournment. The purpose of this matter is to call the Department of Education and Science <Col N="973" /> to account for its treatment of a 15 year old boy from my constituency. This child has repeatedly come into contact with the law on a number of public order offences over the past two and a half to three years. The child comes from a loving family who are completely frustrated at the lack of support given to them in their efforts to control and educate their son.</P>
      <P>This case involves a normal family who have been unable to deal with the emotional, behavioural and educational needs of a child who has become a law unto himself over the past year. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this young person was before Tallaght District Court on 13 separate occasions between March and September this year. On four of these occasions, he was sent to Trinity House but was returned on each occasion because of the Department's failure to provide sufficient residential accommodation for him and other children in similar situations. This young person has not been at school since last February and it would be almost impossible for any school in the locality to take this child on board if he was released from his current accommodation.</P>
      <P>In early September the young person in question was remanded for assessment to the national remand and assessment unit at the Child and Adolescent Centre in Finglas. I learned from a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday that the assessment of his needs was carried out on 29 September and that a report was made available to the court on Monday, 2 October. The assessment clearly identified the specific educational and rehabilitation needs of this person. It also recommended that a place should be made available in Oberstown boys centre in north County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I understand today that no such place has been made available for this child at Oberstown. He remains in Finglas and while he is receiving some tuition at St. Lawrence's school, which, I understand, is within the Child and Adolescent Centre, a tailored programme of rehabilitation can only be put in place when he obtains a place in Oberstown.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's presence in the House and I ask her to outline when such a place will be made available for this 15 year old child. I also ask the Minister of State to respond to the reply to the parliamentary question yesterday in which the Minister, Deputy Woods, said that the court accepted the recommendations made and remanded the young person back to the national remand and assessment unit until 16 October 2000 pending the availability of a place in Oberstown. I ask the Minister to outline the position if 16 October comes and goes without a place being made available in Oberstown. Will this child be sent back to his parents in my constituency? I ask the Minister of State to deal with this question in her reply because that is the key issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This child has become uncontrollable of late. He needs residential care. It took a considerable <Col N="974" /> effort on the part of the local judge in Tallaght to ensure that he finally got a place in Finglas. Following that assessment, it is clear that he needs much more specific and tailored educational attention at Oberstown. When will he get this?</P>
    <P>The child is a danger to himself, his family and his community. He clearly needs high level support in an effort to change his behaviour. My notes on this case go back to February 1998 &ndash; I have the file with me &ndash; when I first attempted to obtain a place for this child in a special school in Dublin. On that occasion it took a considerable length of time before he received attention from the State. The case highlights the complete failure of the State to support parents who have difficult children, and they are a growing group of people within society. This problem child was passed around from one agency to another for a considerable length of time before action was taken.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to respond to the points I made and specifically to ensure that adequate facilities are provided at Oberstown. The longer this child remains in Finglas, the more space he will take up for other children who should be attending the assessment centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this matter. The case he outlined is well known to the Department of Education and Science. The young man was remanded for assessment to the national remand and assessment unit at Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre where he was assessed by professionals with expertise in education, social skills, offending behaviour and relationships. The report, which was completed on 29 September 2000, was presented to the court last Monday.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Hayes said, it identified that the child's needs would best be served by a placement in Oberstown boys centre where a tailored programme will be made available for him, which will encompass education, care and rehabilitative modules. These placements are normally for two years but in the absence of an immediate bed, the court accepted the recommendations made and remanded the person to the national remand and assessment unit until 16 October pending the availability of a long-term committal bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is usual in so far as from time to time difficulties arise with accommodating placements for individual children on the first date on which placement is sought in any particular unit due to pressure on places on a given day. In general, the child in these circumstances is either subsequently placed in that unit or in one of the other facilities as an alternative to or pending the availability of a place in the original unit of preference. A short-term remand bed may be available in Oberstown on 16 October but a long-term committal placement will be available at Oberstown on 4 December 2000. In the meantime an interim education and care programme is in place <Col N="975" /> for the child in the national remand and assessment unit.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Children Bill currently before the House will, when enacted, repeal the Children Act, 1908, and set out a blueprint for a new juvenile justice system. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or who have serious care needs. It is based on the premise that the detention of a child should only be used as a last resort.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the establishment of a residential services board. Deputies will be aware that I established an interim board earlier this year which has met on five occasions and is already working to ensure that we have an effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children with behavioural difficulties but who have not offended and those children who are young offenders.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has responsibility for five centres which provide residential accommodation for young offenders up to the age of 16 or who are placed on remand or sentenced to detention by the courts. Plans for a major redevelopment and enhancement of the range of facilities under the Department have been drawn up to meet the obligations that will arise under the new legislation. These development plans provide for major refurbishment and updating of the existing facilities at Trinity House, Lusk and the care and education unit at Finglas; the phased replacement of the existing outdated facilities at the national remand and assessment unit in Finglas and the Oberstown boys and girls centres; the development of new pre-release units to serve the Finglas and Lusk centres and the development of a new highly specialised secure unit at the Lusk campus.</P>
    <P>The overall development programme will extend over the next five years. Already the new pre-release unit at Finglas has been completed and is in operation since the middle of last year. The major refurbishment of two units at Trinity House has also been completed. It is important to note that while development work is being undertaken, there has been some cutback in the number of beds currently and immediately available. Design teams were appointed last year for the new secure unit at Lusk and for the new national remand and assessment centre to replace the existing national remand and assessment unit at Finglas. The architectural planning of these projects is being progressed with a view to the invitation of tenders from building contractors later this year. Arrangements are currently under way for the appointment of further design teams to progress the remaining elements of the development programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> The above development plans, together with the development of a significant number of high support units and special care units and other services by the health boards, seek to broaden the range of facilities and services available for at risk children. There will be a net increase of 30 places in the provision for young offenders. The new and replacement facilities are being designed to allow for maximum flexibility in the use of the places to cater for fluctuating demand among the different categories in the future. The development of the high support units and special care units by the health boards will provide up to 110 additional residential places for 'at risk' children. When the Government came into power in 1997 there were 16 such places, but that has now increased to 65. Great progress is being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the developments outlined facilitate the additional provision which is needed. Services will be more co-ordinated in future. I am confident the Children Bill, the policy of early intervention and the support structures which are being put in place will ensure we can avoid children coming into the care of the State and that detention will only be used as a last resort. However, if detention is necessary or children need the care of the State, they will receive the best care and education provision possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Air Corps Crash.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic deaths 14 months ago of Captain Dave Flaherty, Captain Mick Baker, Sergeant Pat Mooney and Captain Niall Byrne represented the worst accident in the history of the Air Corps. These four young men had completed a sterling day's work before meeting their fatal end. Just before their Dauphin helicopter crashed into a sand dune on Tramore beach, they had successfully completed a rescue operation off the Dungarvan coast.</P>
      <P>The publication last week of the report into this tragedy by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise is a serious indictment of the Department of Defence, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and of senior ranks in the Air Corps. That the report found no fewer than two active causes, six contributory causes and nine systemic causes for the crash points to serious system failures in the Department and the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inescapable conclusion in the report is that a decision was taken to locate the Dauphin at Waterford Regional Airport from 1 July 1999, a day before the crash, to meet a public commitment given by the Government. This decision was made without due regard for adequate support infrastructure, including a qualified air traffic controller at Waterford airport, to ensure the crew could perform their duties safely and efficiently. Responsibility must lie with the Minister and his Department. This shortcoming in the plans for the launch of the Dauphin from Waterford is just one of a litany of examples where the <Col N="977" /> Department and the Defence Forces did not work together to ensure they were properly resourced.</P>
    <P>Contributory factors, such as crew fatigue and work pressures, are also serious issues which must be addressed by both the relevant Departments and senior ranks in the Air Corps. That the crew did not have access to catering facilities and accommodation at the airport shows a serious flaw in the decision to launch the helicopter from Waterford. Once again, a political decision was put before the people involved in executing the work.</P>
    <P>One other recommendation in the report relates to the establishment by the Department of Defence of a fully resourced air safety office in the Air Corps. This recommendation was made in 1998 by the Pricewaterhouse review of the Naval Service and Air Corps and it should not be allowed to continue to collect dust. The Minister must tell the House this recommendation will be implemented now, not next week. The other recommendations should also be acted upon immediately. If expert advice is needed to implement them, it should be sought at an international level if we do not have it available in this country. I have raised safety issues with the Minister on previous occasions and he took action on them. I have no doubt he will take this report seriously.</P>
    <P>More than a year ago the House passed legislation to extend the area of the Irish Sea by a further 200 miles. The need to ensure the Air Corps is properly resourced has never been greater. This week a total of 21 fishermen were lost at sea in two separate tragedies. Without the rapid response of the Air Corps to these tragedies, there would not have been any survivors. I pay tribute to the Air Corps for its part in these rescue operations in recent days. Its instant response to the tragedies and the efficiency with which it managed to rescue the survivors is commendable and shows how important the Air Corps is for this island. Already, to my distress, there has been much buck-passing with regard to the findings of the report. It is incumbent on the parties implicated in this report to accept and implement the full 25 recommendations contained in the report. A tragedy like that which took place on the fateful night of 2 July last should never be allowed to happen again.</P>

    <P>The publication last week of the final report by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999, in which four members of the Air Corps, Captain David O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne, were tragically killed, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, the Defence Forces and the public in general. I avail of this oppor<Col N="978" /> tunity again to pay tribute to these brave young men who gave their lives in the service of others and to express my sympathy to the families for their sad and tragic loss.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the investigation was to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. The report, which is a very comprehensive and detailed document, is being studied in my Department at present. The safety recommendations set out in the report which called for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. Those which call for action by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources are being closely examined and studied in that Department with a view to their immediate implementation.</P>
    <P>I am putting arrangements in place to ensure that all the safety recommendations are addressed comprehensively by the relevant bodies. An initial meeting of a working group is being held in my Department tomorrow afternoon involving representatives from the Defence Forces, as well as from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, for the purpose of establishing a review mechanism in relation to the implementation of the safety recommendations contained in the report. I intend that this group will meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the full implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report. Progress reports from the various bodies involved will be presented and reviewed following which composite progress reports will be presented to me at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will understand, however, that it would be premature at this stage to formulate a firm timetable for the full implementation of the safety recommendations arising from the air accident investigation unit report in view of the complexity of certain issues involved. Suffice to say that all safety recommendations which call for action by the Department of Defence and the Air Corps are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their urgent implementation. In this regard, the air safety office recommended in the first safety recommendation is being established with immediate effect. An air safety officer has been appointed by the general officer commanding the Air Corps to this position.</P>
    <P>Action has already begun to implement the recommendation that the Department of Defence should commission, on behalf of the Air Corps, an independent air operations safety audit by an agency with a proven track record of expertise in military aviation. In this regard, my Department has asked the Department of Public Enterprise to advise regarding the sourcing of appropriate expertise to carry out the recommended air operations safety audit. I have directed that this audit is to be carried out as soon as possible by a suitably qualified agency in a comprehensive and effective manner. All support necessary will be provided by both the Department of Defence and <Col N="979" /> the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has confirmed that it has made progress on a number of recommendations. It is, <i>inter alia</i>, upgrading the training available for coastguard units in dealing with incidents of serious aircraft accidents as recommended. It has also agreed to review the aviation expertise and training requirements for personnel involved in the tasking of search and rescue air assets as recommended.</P>
    <P>In addition to the air accident unit investigation, a military court of inquiry was convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be the examination of both the final report of the air accident investigation unit and the coroner's report. The work of the military court of inquiry, therefore, will now proceed following publication of the final report of the air accident investigation unit. The court of inquiry must also await the coroner's court findings.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I am firm in my resolve to have the safety recommendations contained in this very comprehensive report implemented as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter for the Adjournment debate. It gives me no great pleasure to have to raise this matter. Last August, 114 people lost their jobs in Warner's. That was the third setback the people of north Mayo experienced last year. Norsk Hydro also closed its operation in Geesala earlier this year with the loss of another 40 jobs. We had the other spectacle of Údarás training people for an American company, Mediscription Incorporated, to come into Erris last year. These people were trained, ready and able and they were told that these jobs would materialise, but they did not. That has been a devastating blow for the people of north Mayo. It was sad to see 114 people lose their jobs last August when everybody else in the country was going on their three week annual holiday. Many families, brothers and sisters, will now have to emigrate because there is no work available for them. I am calling on the Government to set up a ministerial task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down questions to the Tánaiste today asking her to meet a representative group of the workers, but she has not done that. She said that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, will meet the workers. It is very sad that the Tánaiste will not meet the workers to allow them put their case to her. I am <Col N="980" /> disappointed the Taoiseach and the Government have not responded by setting up a ministerial task force because this is probably the blackest spot in the entire country. This is the place where people see no hope.</P>
    <P>Erris is as big as County Louth and it is outrageous that there is such unemployment. It gives me no pleasure to say that, jobwise, Údarás has failed the Gaeltacht and the people of Mayo. Its annual report of 1998 states that it created 114 jobs and lost 117. In the 1999 report it states that it created 104 jobs and lost 148. God help us when the 2000 report comes out next year because it will be a black day.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Ó Cuív, is here tonight. He has visited Erris and has done his job as Minister. He has met the workers and all the interested groups, but what we need now is intervention by a senior Minister. We want a ministerial task force. We want to see action. We want a commitment from the Government that it will try to do something.</P>
    <P>We also have the situation where, in the year 2004, Bellacorick will close down. There has been a gas find in north Mayo and I want to record that I, as a public representative for the county of Mayo, will fight tooth and nail to make sure the Government delivers to the people of Erris in terms of infrastructure, jobs and in every other way. This natural resource will assist the State and the people of that area who have been deprived since the foundation of the State should get their share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>I am calling for the setting up of a ministerial task force to get Coca Cola or some other such company to invest in north Mayo. The longer this matter goes on, the more the workers will lose and they will be forced to find employment outside the area. That is bad for the schools, shops, business and the area in general. It is up to the Minister to ensure we get a commitment from the Government in relation to north Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Deputy Ring and thank him for giving me some of his time to speak on this matter. This is an incidence of appalling neglect and failure to deliver and it is a classic case of an area falling between two departmental stools. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has been active on his brief but Údarás has always had crumbs from the table of the Industrial Development Authority. The Tánaiste has refused to deal with this issue because technically it is in a Gaeltacht area. Nothing will happen unless there is ministerial concentration and a direction to the job-finding agencies to deliver in north Mayo as a priority. As Deputy Ring pointed out, Norsk Hydro went to the wall, Warner's is closed and Bellacorick is due to go in the next few years. There is an air of devastation and of disappointment and gloom in the area. The position is not being helped by the Government's attitude and its failure to direct and concentrate political and ministerial resources in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> At a time when we are concentrating efforts on bringing in one of the richest gas finds in Europe, if not on a world scale, what is happening is akin to the life's blood of Erris being pumped out through that pipeline. Young men and women and young fathers and mothers want to live in this quality area and to have an opportunity to play their part, but that will not happen unless Ministers concentrate their efforts. Task forces were set up following the closures of Asahi, Betatherm and Warner's, but none of them was fruitful. Unless ministerial resources are concentrated in the area nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to have broken a mould in that in the past when meetings regarding such closures took place with senior Ministers or with the Taoiseach, all Oireachtas Members representing all sides were called to them. Will the Minister of State confirm that the closures of Warner's and Norsk Hydro and the pending closure of Bellacorick, and by implication Bord na Móna, were discussed at the meeting today with the Taoiseach? Was the question of a task force discussed? Will the Minister of State indicate why other Oireachtas Members representing the people concerned are not allowed attend such meetings, why they are held in secret and discussions include one party only when the people concerned are represented across the House?</P>

      <P>I was more than surprised to hear what Deputy Ring said. I thought I had set up a task force to address the immediate issue of alternative jobs for the workforce of Warner's factory and to deal with the longer-term issue of improving the overall infrastructure of the Erris Gaeltacht with a view to developing its potential as an industrial and service employment location. I am surprised that news did not filter through to Deputy Ring. The task force is in place. I have met the former workforce of the Warner's factory on two occasions since its closure. The Deputy should be aware that represented on the task force are Údarás na Gaeltachta, my Department,&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the IDA, IBEC, FÁS, Mayo County Council, SIPTU and the former workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the task force are to assess and recommend the most appropriate response to offset and compensate for the job losses arising from the closure of Warner's; to assist in the process of identifying a suitable replacement project or projects; to draw up a set of priority actions to address the infrastructural <Col N="982" /> deficiencies which could hinder job creation in Belmullet and to assess the education-training needs of the workforce of Warner's (Eire) Teoranta and the labour force in general in Belmullet.</P>
    <P>The task force commenced its work before Warner's factory closed and held its third meeting on 26 September. Assessment by FÁS and Údarás of the training needs of Warner's workers also commenced before the factory closed. The majority of the workers expressed a wish to be trained in IT. Already a course, Bridging to Information Technology, has been commenced by FÁS and is being attended by about 20 people. The course will last for eight weeks and it is hoped another group will commence a simliar course when the first one finishes. Immediately after that a further course, Certificate in Computer Applications, will commence and will provide a further step for those who have satisfactorily completed the first course. It is felt that if the unemployment problems in Belmullet are to be solved in the long-term there will be a need for intensive training in all aspects of the IT industry.</P>
    <P>As outlined, the main focus of the task force is on training and education, employment and infrastructure. With regard to education, it would be of major benefit if third level educational courses were available in the area. It is worthy of note that 75% of the young people of Erris obtain third level education but one of the problems we face in rural Ireland is the challenge of creating employment suitable to their needs. Similar analysis of the labour force in Belmullet, Erris and the Mayo Gaeltacht reveals that a disproportionate number of people have attained only the leaving certificate or less, therefore there is a massive brain drain out of this area. That has been going on for a long time. It is being exacerbated by the job situation and we must address it. Anyone who tells me that problems can be solved in one fell swoop by waving a magic wand is wrong. The task force has contacted the NUI, Galway and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and it is hoped to commence negotiations regarding education needs shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, certain steps have been taken. At its September board meeting, Údarás na Gaeltachta approved assistance for a project with a job target of 22 for the locality within a year or so. Furthermore, it is hoped that a proposal for assistance for a project of a simliar size will be submitted at the October meeting of Údarás, while other projects are under negotiation. As part of the job creation drive, the task force and I have written to the Minister for Finance making the case for the location of public sector jobs in Belmullet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on that have not been made. Four factories employing 20 people are better than one employing 80 because the spread of jobs, as I witnessed in my area, reduces the risk factor and allows for much greater expansion.</P>
      <P>A profile of the area and of Warner's factory was prepared for distribution among industrialists and IDA offices abroad. A more attractive multi-coloured brochure is nearing completion and will be used in a marketing campaign to be commenced shortly. I understand that Údarás has been in contact with a number of industrialists and site visits have been organised. There is a feeling of confidence that projects will emerge from the work that has been undertaken to date. A meeting has been held with Enterprise Oil regarding the possiblity of jobs being created in the Erris area arising out of the bringing ashore of gas from the Corrib field at Poll an Tómais. There was also general discussion with Enterprise Oil regarding possible use of gas for energy purposes in the region.</P>
      <P>Members who live in Gaeltacht areas and represent the people there, as I do, will recognise that the infrastructural needs of those areas must be addressed to ensure the viability of long-term sustainable jobs. I addressed that issue very early in my ministry. However, the infrastructural deficiencies in this area are many and include problems regarding the lack of power supply and telecommunications. The task force has been in contact with people in the ESB and Eircom and has made submissions at its last meeting regarding development of the telecommunications and electricity systems in the region. As Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I have been following up that issue in a more general context, as I realise roads are not the only highways and the new technology highway is of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, independently of the task force and prior to the factory closure, commenced work on a strategic roads initiative for the Gaeltacht, as a lack of proper basic infrastructure has been a major problem in Gaeltacht areas. Works have commenced on a seven year programme and £0.5 million will be spent this year upgrading the spinal roads in the Erris area. That programme is due to continue for the next six years and I am in negotiation with the county council regarding programmes for the coming years of work. Quite an amount of activity is taking place, but the time constraint that applies does not permit me to <Col N="984" /> cover all the work that is being carried out in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a further point. Warner's was a factory situated in the Gaeltacht. As a consequence, and until the people of Erris decide to leave the Gaeltacht, the responsibility for industrial development in that area primarily falls on my Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta. In that situation, the proper Minister to be dealing with this issue is myself under the arrangements we have in this State.</P>
    <P>However, the IDA has a role to play and that issue is being pursued to ensure that in general terms the IDA, which is the international agency, provides the contacts for Údarás, but the primary responsibility for industrial development in the Gaeltacht areas rests with Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a copy of the WWF's &ldquo;Habitats Directive WWF European Shadow List&rdquo; and have noted its contents. The picture painted by the WWF is unnecessarily gloomy in respect of my proposals in relation to Irish SACs. The document refers to a 95% insufficiency in habitat sites and a 96% insufficiency in species sites as determined at a biogeographical seminar last year. However, this position does not take account of all my published proposals and reflected only sites already formally transmitted to the EU Commission at the time of the seminar. The delay in transmission resulted from the Government's commitment to consult fully with landowners and allow for the consideration of objections in order to secure broad acceptance of our proposals.</P>
      <P>My Department will examine proposals for additional SACs from WWF and other sources. However, I would point out that the land and freshwater sites advertised to date cover almost 10% of the land area of the State and marine sites an additional 4%. This places Ireland mid-way in the tables of the percentage of territory included in the Natura 2000 network by the member states. The directive requires member states to contribute to the creation of the Natura 2000 network in proportion to the representation within its territory of habitats and species listed in the directive. I am satisfied that this condition will be met by my proposals once formal transmission is completed.</P>

To date in excess of 13,500 landowners have been notified individually. I have also arranged for my officials to assist landowners and users in electing local liaison committees. These committees give landowners a direct input into decisions about management regimes for individual sites.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have established an SAC appeals advisory board to hear objections from landowners to the inclusion of their lands within proposed sites.

      <P>The Government decided in June 2000 that the process of establishing a digital terrestrial television, DTT, platform in Ireland should proceed on the basis of two separate operations. RTE will be required to offer its network and transmission business for sale on the basis that it will retain an equity stake of not more than 28% of the entity thus created. Separately, the six DTT multiplexes will be offered to the market.</P>
      <P>As a result, the sections in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, which deal with the establishment, licensing and obligations of the designated company &ndash; the single DTT entity envisaged under the original decision &ndash; need to be amended to cater for the establishment, licensing and obligations of two separate companies. There will also be consequential amendments to other sections in the Bill. The combined functions and objectives of the two separated entities will, however, be broadly the same as those envisaged in the case of the single DTT entity provided for in the existing Bill. Consequently, the overall purpose and scope of this part of the Bill will not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drafting of the proposed amendments is at an advanced stage, I intend to bring the proposed text to Government for approval shortly and to forward it to the Bills Office later this month. My Department has confirmed informally to the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Langu<Col N="987" /> age my readiness to proceed with Committee Stage towards the end of this month as envisaged by the committee. As I previously indicated, I also intend to introduce a number of amendments in addition to those arising in the context of the change of approach in establishing DTT platform.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 100, 102 and 111 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to these questions, which are prompted by a speech I gave at Boston College, Massachusetts, USA, on 18 September last. In the course of my speech, I referred to factors likely to have contributed to the Celtic tiger and was happy to acknowledge that our membership of the European Union had been a very important and positive factor in that context. I acknowledged that participation in the European Union has been good for Ireland. It has helped us to grow in self-confidence as a mature outward-looking democracy.</P>
    <P>I see absolutely no contradiction between, on the one hand, acknowledging the benefits of EU membership and, on the other, highlighting the fact that at times insufficient weight is given to the principle of subsidiarity. All member states of the Union value the preservation of their separate identities, culture and traditions so if we feel that some community initiatives attach insufficient weight to these values, why not say so? In my experience, the bureaucracy of Brussels does not always respect the complexities and sensitivities of member states.</P>
    <P>One example coming within my remit has been the implementation of the Habitats Directive. May I state categorically that I am committed to the implementation of the Habitats Directive and to the putting in place of the Natura 2000 network in Ireland. However, I consider that this can only be done successfully if there is acceptance of the necessary measures among farmers and other landowners and users for the purpose of designating special areas of conservation. The transposition of the Habitats Directive into Irish law took place in March 1997 under the previous Administration. Accordingly, I have sought since my appointment as Minister to put in place enhanced systems of consultation and of procedures for appeals/objections, with a view to bringing all interested parties on board, rather than imposing a system against people's will. This has inevitably led to some delay. However, I feel that a better understanding on the part of Brussels of the social and cultural factors involved, and the need to persuade rather than coerce, might lead to more positive and fruitful results &ndash; rather than proceeding by way of the purely legal remedy adopted of bringing Ireland before the European Court of Justice. Before I took office, no SAC sites had been transmitted to Brussels, but since my appointment, 315 of the proposed sites have been transmitted, leaving a balance of 48 outstanding. I intend to complete this process by the end of November.</P>
    <P>I said in my speech in Boston that I look forward to a future in which Ireland will exercise a more vigilant, a more questioning attitude to the European Union. I spoke of the need for a debate in Ireland on our place in the European Union and its place in our lives. I am pleased at the extent of the public comment that has taken place since and I look forward to a continuation of this debate in the coming months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> One issue which will require serious debate is the area of public service broadcasting, particularly in light of indications that certain views may be held within the European Commission which may not coincide with Ireland's strong stance in regard to public service broadcasting as an area that must be left to individual member states and cannot be undermined.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission has had concerns about Ireland's proposals for special areas of conservation for grey dunes and for the mollusc <i>Vertigo angustior</i>, including concerns relating to a particular site at Doonbeg, County Clare. Arising from these developments EU co-funding for the development of a golf course at Doonbeg has been suspended. I have not yet competed formal transmission of my proposals for special areas of conservation. I am satisfied that my proposals will comply fully with the requirements of the Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place with EU Commission officials with a view to resolving the matter, and enabling the suspension to be lifted. I understand that the sum involved is £2.4 million. As the discussions are ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 124 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, there has been an increasing impact on the archaeological heritage arising from the upsurge in development work on foot of our unprecedented economic growth and this led to unprecedented pressure on <Col N="990" /> departmental resources earlier this year. I have now introduced a number of improvements which will support the protection of the archaeological heritage. These involve the following: the resolution of the long-standing contractual difficulties in relation to the archaeologists employed on contract &ndash; the people involved have now been given contracts of employment for five years; the provision of eight additional archaeological posts; addressing the backlog of licence reports and reducing the period for processing new applications; agreement on a code of practice with the National Roads Authority on the protection of archaeological sites under its road development programme &ndash; this code will serve as a model for similar codes with other development sectors with whom discussions are already under way; advancement of plans for the re-organisation of structures and resources that will give a regional focus to the operation of the archaeological services, thus providing better service delivery to many of the Department's customers and putting funding in place to assist local authorities to employ their own archaeologists. In addition, I hope to announce details shortly of the funding to be provided for the protection of the archaeological heritage under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined above will, among other things, enable more on-site inspections, including archaeological testing and excavations, to be carried out by my archaeological staff. This need was identified in the Heritage Council's report on inadequate site testing being undertaken by professional archaeologists. While the increased inspections will lead to improvements in the standard of excavation work, there is also a role to be played by the profession itself in the area of self-regulation. My officials have met the profession's representative group, the Irish Association of Professional Archaeologists, and the early indications are that progress can be made on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>These improvements are, of course, underpinned by the extensive legislation already in place which gives legal protection to some 120,000 archaeological sites and monuments. Even so, I am anxious to ensure that the legislation continues to meet our needs as the archaeological heritage faces up to the pressures of a new millennium. I have, therefore, initiated a review of the national monuments legislation and, following initial consultation, an &ldquo;issues document&rdquo; is in the course of finalisation. Other initiatives will also feature in the national heritage plan, which is currently in draft form and has been circulated to other Departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department continues its core activity of identification and validation of archaeological sites and monuments under the Archaeological Survey of Ireland. The information thus collected and disseminated is a vital tool in helping those involved in all aspects of land management to arrive at informed decisions. I am proposing to step up the rate of progress on the <Col N="991" /> survey with the aim of having it completed by 2005. In tandem with this, plans are in train for the establishment of a built heritage archive, a much needed facility for those who require access to, and information on, the archaeological heritage as part of their professional, academic educational or other pursuits.</P>
    <P>I trust the Deputies will agree that this year has seen a great deal of progress in the protection of the archaeological heritage and that further improvements will be made.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in response to Japan's decision to issue special permits to take Sperm and Bryde's whales for the purposes of scientific research, the President of the USA is considering trade sanctions. The Deputy will be aware of Ireland's strong stance on the conservation of whales which has been pursued consistently at the International Whaling Commission. I share the concerns of the USA and other countries that taking of Sperm and Bryde's whales represents an extension of the scope of whaling under special permits to three species instead of one species previously. At this year's meeting in Adelaide of the Commission Ireland supported Resolution 52/36 asking Japan not to proceed with its new scientific whaling programme.</P>
      <P>Since the Adelaide meeting, I arranged to meet the Ambassador of Japan to Ireland in my office and made clear to her my disappointment with the stand of Japan on scientific whaling. I have since authorised the Irish Ambassador to Japan to lead a diplomatic demarche to the Japanese Government on behalf of 15 embassies &ndash; Austria, Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and USA &ndash;  requesting Japan not to proceed with its scientific whaling proposals for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has put forward proposals to the International Whaling Commission which would bring scientific whaling under control. It is important to note that under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling any contracting Government may issue special permits to take whales for scientific purposes and such whaling is exempt from the operation of this convention. Accordingly, the Commission does not control <Col N="992" /> scientific permit whaling and Ireland's proposals require the agreement of all parties. Although we have got a lot of support we have not yet succeeded in getting full consensus. I propose to continue dialogue with other countries within the International Whaling Commission to seek a resolution of this problem.</P>

      <P>There have been 13 formal and informal meetings of EU Culture Ministers since July 1997, five of which I attended personally and the remainder were attended by senior officials of my Department. The most recent EU Culture Ministers meeting attended by me was in Lille, France on 20 and 21 July 2000 under the auspices of the French Presidency.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not always possible to re-schedule clashing diary commitments. By way of illustration of this dilemma, I had hoped to be in a position to attend the most recent Council meeting held last week but, unfortunately, it clashed with a plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council at which my presence was also required.</P>

For the Deputy's information, these are: www.heritageireland.ie, which is a promotional website for the heritage sites managed by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and the national cultural institutions which come under the aegis of my Department; www.heritagedata.ie, which provides GIS databases of national monuments, historic properties, parks and wildlife reserves; and www.irlgov.ie/ealga, which is the general departmental website.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group was approved by the management advisory committee of my Department recently and a websites project board has been put in place.

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No 1, on 2 March 2000, section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, provides that I have the power to draw up and amend, from time to time as I think appropriate, codes governing standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Chapter 14 of the current codes imposes a number of restrictions on advertisers with regard to advertising and children's programmes including prohibitions on advertisements which exploit children's inexperience or credulity or advertisements which encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase or make inquiries about goods or services being advertised. Chapter 14 reflects the requirement of Directive 89/522/EEC (Television Without Frontiers).</P>
      <P>Chapter 15 deals with restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic drinks and includes, among other things, a prohibition on broadcasters from transmitting alcoholic drink advertising which may encourage young people to begin drinking or which is aimed at minors or depict minors consuming such beverages. The chapter also prohibits the transmission of alcoholic drink advertising in or around programmes primarily intended for young viewers or listeners.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce further restrictions in these areas. However, as I have indicated previously, responsibility for drawing up codes specifying the codes and standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services will devolve to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to be renamed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, under the provisions of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, when it is enacted.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I have indeed received proposals from the National Museum regarding extended opening hours of the museum.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a previous parliamentary question on this matter, the extension of the existing opening hours by the National Museum carries major financial and staffing implications. These matters are under consideration by my Department at present and a final decision will be made at the earliest possible date, having regard to the resources available in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the protection of the architectural heritage, I am very aware of the need to ensure that the architectural heritage which is in the ownership of public authorities receives ample protection. It is for this reason that I established the task group on policy for the conservation of historic buildings in public authority ownership which reported to the interdepartmental working group on advancing the Government's policy objectives on architecture. This working group includes representatives of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, the Office of Public Works, the Heritage Council, and the Arts Council, as well as my own Department. I expect that the report of the working group will be submitted formally to me in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also preparing the national heritage plan, the first comprehensive strategy encompassing all aspects of our national heritage. This process involved wide consultation, including the involvement of all Departments. The plan will include proposals for the protection of our architectural heritage. I hope to bring the draft <Col N="996" /> national heritage plan to Government before the end of the year</P>

      <P>The national heritage plan will be the first comprehensive strategy encompassing all aspects of our national heritage to be prepared in the history of the State. My Department has undertaken a broad public consultation process in relation to the development of the national heritage plan and some 350 submissions were received. Parallel preparatory work was undertaken within my Department, involving an assessment of the current management of our heritage. The work is being overseen by a steering group comprising officials of my Department and representatives of the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>Overall the process represents the most fundamental and critical examination undertaken of the current state of Irish heritage and the needs for the future. The draft plan was circulated to Government Departments on a consultative basis during the summer and their reactions to the proposals are being followed up. I hope to be in a position to bring the national heritage plan to Government for approval before the end of the year, with publication following as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>Bhunaigh an Rialtas Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i mí Aibreáin 2000 chun moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis an nGaeilge a láidriú mar ghnáththeanga phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá cóip de Théarmaí Tagartha an Choimisiúin curtha timpeall sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil mar chuid den fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh 87 den 12 Aibreán 2000. Tuigim ó Chathaoirleach an Choimisiúin go bhfuil: obair an Choimisiúin ag dul ar aghaidh go sásúil; go leor eolais le bailiú ag an gCoimisiún ar dtús agus gur gá ainilís a dhéanamh ar an eolas sin ansin; go bhfuil an próiseas sin tosaithe cheana féin agus go bhfuil cuimse mhaith aighneachtaí faighte ón bpobal; go mbeidh cruinnithe poiblí sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di go luath chun obair an Choimisiúin a phlé agus chun tuairimí agus moltaí an phobail a fháil; agus go dtógfaidh sé níos mó ná bliain (an spriocdáta a luadh nuair a ceapadh an Coimisiún) chun obair an Choimisiúin a chur i gcrích go hiomlán.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go n-aontóidh an Teachta liom gur fearr an obair thábhachtach a dhéanamh go críochnúil fiú má théann sé taobh amuigh den sprioc-ama a bhí leagtha síos ag an tús. Mar sin b'fhearr liom gan dáta sonrach a lua ag an bpointe seo do thuarascáil ón gcoimisiún.            </P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>if her Department had discussions with Trinity College prior to them making a decision to allow one of the volumes of the Book of Kells to be sent to Australia; if so, when these discussions took place; if, as a result of her Department's intervention in this matter, permission was granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The issue of the temporary export of a volume of the Book of Kells to the National Gallery of Australia was first brought to the attention of my Department in April 1999. Officials of my Department wrote to the Trinity College authorities in May 1999 advising that any proposals in this regard should be cleared in the first instance with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trinity authorities subsequently wrote to me on 22 July 1999 requesting that an export licence be issued by my Department in respect of the temporary export on loan of a volume of the Book of Kells. This application was supported by expert advice from within the college. The views of the Director of the National Museum of <Col N="1002" /> Ireland and the Council of National Cultural Institutions &ndash; CNCI &ndash; were sought. Both the CNCI and the Director of the National Museum advised against granting the export licence.</P>
    <P>In November 1999 a Government decision was made to facilitate the application on the understanding that stringent security arrangements would be made in respect of transportation and safekeeping. On foot of this decision my officials wrote to officials of Trinity College Dublin in December 1999 and followed this up with a meeting in January 2000. An application for a temporary export licence was subsequently submitted to my Department by TCD. The licence was granted in February 2000 on completion of a deed of indemnity by the college authorities.</P>

      <P>The next census of population will be held on Sunday, 29 April 2001. The census will cover everyone who is present in the country on census night. This accords with the definition used in previous censuses. Persons will be enumerated where they spend census night, for instance in private households, hotels, guest-houses, hospitals, barracks, etc. For the first time demographic detail will be sought for usual residents temporarily absent on census night.</P>
      <P>The full list of questions is given in the following table:</P>

    <P>The census will be carried out by a dedicated field force consisting of five Census Liaison Officers, 35 Regional Supervisors, 350 Field Supervisors and 4,000 Enumerators. The first two layers have already been appointed while advertisements have been placed in the press for the 350 field supervisor positions with a view to appointment in early January. The enumerators will be appointed for a ten week period commencing in early April 2000.</P>
    <P>It is planned to release the first headcount information within three months of census day. This is normally accurate to within 3,000 to 4,000 of the final census count. With a view to speeding up the processing of the census returns it is proposed on this occasion to use scanning and recognition technology. Instead of keying the information from the census forms to computer as in previous censuses, it is planned that the forms will be scanned and the information on the scanned images recognised using character recognition <Col N="1004" /> technology. This will allow the definite results to be published in a more timely fashion heretofore.</P>

Kells Bay is among the pier and harbours projects in County Kerry which have been submitted to my Department by the county council for funding support. While significant funding has been allocated in respect of harbour works in County Kerry this year, it was not possible, having regard to overall harbour development requirements, to provide funding for works at Kells. The possibility of providing financial assistance for works at this location will, however, be kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the local authority, in the drawing up of fishery harbour programmes for future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent development in the USA of the new beef product known as &ldquo;heat and serve&rdquo;. I understand that the main advantage of this product is that it can be sold on the basis of being microwavable for seven to ten minutes which has the obvious potential to satisfy today's consumer needs. In addition, through a combination of tenderisation of certain cuts and some muscle manipulation/reforming, inexpensive cuts of beef such as the chuck and pieces of the round and the sirloin can be processed into a higher value added product having the characteristics of a rib roast both in terms of taste, smell and consistency .</P>
      <P>Bord Bia has been reviewing opportunities in new product development for beef, specifically in the heat and serve category developed by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the US meat industry and will lead a meat trade delegation next week to the US to evaluate these opportunities further. The delegation includes the leading meat processors and also representatives from IBEC, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland. The visit has been organised with the support of NCBA and will include plant visits and meetings with companies involved in the heat and serve category as well as participation at the Innovation Showcase organised by the American Meat Institute.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently seeking out likely interest among Irish beef processors in this product. The forthcoming visit to the USA should help to encourage a more active interest in this matter. I understand, however, that considerable financial investment would be necessary in order to establish production facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand that Teagasc has already undertaken research in the area of re-formed steaks and the presence of a representative of Teagasc on the visit should help to progress research further into this type of product. I would, of course, encourage such research. In addition, while the outcome of the USA visit must be awaited, I would be very supportive of any initiative which might be undertaken in the future in relation to investigating and if appropriate realising the potential of producing heat and serve beef on a commercial basis here in Ireland. The beef industry needs to diversify if it is to fulfill the expectations set out for it in the Agri 2010 and the beef task force reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU legislation all member states must operate the EU beef carcase classification scheme. This is a system for describing the shape and fat cover of the carcase in a standardised manner. It was set up in 1980 in order to provide a uniform method of recording beef prices and determining eligibility for intervention in each member state. While the classification system is primarily concerned with meat yield, it is used in the beef trade to reflect consumer requirements in relation to quality. For example, research by An Bord Bia has shown that consumer demand in the United Kingdom for a higher fat cover is reflected in the general demand from traders in that market for grades URO, 2, 3, 4. On the other hand, demand in France, where consumer's preference is for leaner beef, is for grades EUR, 2, 3, 4. Because quality aspects such as flavour, tenderness and fat colour are highly subjective, vary from market to market, and are often dependent on the handling of beef post classification, in particular the maturation period, it is not practicable for the classification system to measure such traits. These qualitative aspects are best demonstrated under the type of quality assurance scheme operated by An Bord Bia. There is also a number of private schemes which are designed to produce the type and quality of beef demanded in individual markets.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I believe that it would not be appropriate to move from the present EU beef carcase classification scheme, which is sufficiently objective in measuring carcase quality to a system based on quality aspects which are highly subjective.</P>

      <P>A pension paid under the scheme of early retirement from farming must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension to which the participant is entitled. Where a participant enters the scheme in joint management with a spouse or partner, the same rule applies to the pension paid under the scheme if the spouse or partner becomes entitled to a national pension. It is a condition of the scheme that a participant and his or her spouse or partner must, on reaching their 66th birthday, apply to <Col N="1008" /> the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old-age pension and must notify my Department of the result. This condition has been operative since the scheme commenced in 1994 and participants in the scheme are informed of this condition when they join.</P>

      <P>Set out below is the information sought by the Deputy. <Col N="1009" /> The information was provided by the Revenue Commissioners. Tax relief is available for tuition fees paid for: full-time approved undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in private third level colleges in the State; full-time qualifying undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in publicly funded universities or similar third level colleges in any EU member state. Courses in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry or teacher training are excluded from the relief; part-time approved undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in publicly funded third level institutions and private colleges in the State; and part-time approved undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
      <P>The colleges and courses within the State are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees must be paid: by an individual on his/her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian, to an approved college within the State or to a qualifying college in another EU member state for an approved full-time/part-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration.</P>
      <P>For the tax years 1996/97 to 1999/2000 inclusive, relief for part-time courses is confined to tuition fees paid by an individual on his/her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse. For the tax year 2000/2001 onwards the relief is extended to include tuition fees for an individual's child or a person for whom the individual is the legal guardian.</P>
      <P>The relief for part-time courses is confined to students who have not been conferred with a certificate, diploma or degree in respect of an undergraduate course of not less than two years duration, or have already been conferred with a certificate or diploma in respect of an undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and are pursuing an approved course as part of the qualification held.</P>
      <P>An unrelated course does not qualify for relief.</P>
      <P>Courses which are normally of not less than two years duration but which, because of exemptions following conferring of a related certificate or diploma, may be completed in less than two years, are also eligible for relief.</P>
      <P>The amount of the qualifying fees allowable for full-time and part-time courses for an academic year beginning on 1 August in each tax year is determined by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance. From the tax year 1996-97 to date the maximum level of fees on which relief is allowable is £2,500. Relief is granted at the standard rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax relief is available for the tax year 2000/2001 onwards for tuition fees paid for full-time and part-time approved postgraduate courses in private colleges and publicly funded colleges in the State and full-time and part-time postgraduate courses in a university or publicly funded col<Col N="1010" /> lege in another EU Member State, including such colleges that provide distance education.</P>
    <P>Colleges and courses within the State are approved by the Minister for Education and Science. Courses must be of at least one academic year, but not more than four academic years in duration and must lead to a postgraduate award based on either a thesis or an examination. The person taking the course must already have a primary degree or an equivalent qualification.</P>
    <P>Tuition fees paid by the individual on his/her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>The amount of the qualifying fees allowable for full-time and part-time courses for an academic year beginning on 1 August in each tax year is determined by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister of Finance.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Education and Science is in the process of compiling such a list of colleges and courses which will be available shortly. I also understand that the Minister for Education and Science will be writing to me shortly about the maximum level of fees he proposes will qualify for tax relief.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is available for the 1997-98 tax year onwards for fees paid for approved training courses in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.</P>
    <P>Relief is available for one course per individual in a tax year. To qualify for the relief the course must: be an information technology or foreign language course, other than a postgraduate course. The course and course providers are approved by FÁS, based on codes of standards agreed by FÁS and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the consent of the Minister for Finance; be of less than two years duration; and result in the awarding of a certificate of competence, not just a certificate of attendance.</P>
    <P>A foreign language is defined as a language other than an official language of the State. Courses on either the Irish or English language do not qualify. Foreign languages includes Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.</P>
    <P>For the tax years 1997-98 to 1999-2000, inclusive the relief is available in respect of tuition fees, paid by the individual on his/her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse. For the tax year 2000/2001 onwards the relief is extended to an individual's child or a person for whom the individual is the legal guardian.</P>
    <P>The relief is granted in the tax year in which the certificate of competence is issued. The legislation came into effect on 31 March 1998. Relief may be due for fees paid earlier than 31 March 1998 if the course is an approved course and a certificate of competence has been issued to the participant after 31 March 1998.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is available at the standard rate of income tax where the net tuition fees for an <Col N="1011" /> approved course is more than £250. Relief is not available where fees are less than £250. The maximum relief is £1,000 per course. Relief is not available for any part of the tuition fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise or administration or examination fees.</P>

Some 1,500 places were available on this year's programmes, which commenced on 2 October 2000, compared with 1,200 last year. This 25% increase in pre-registration training places is in response to the current shortage of nurses, and it is intended that 1,500 places will also be available in 2001 and 2002.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 March 2000, the Eastern Regional Health Authority assumed responsibility for all health service issues in the eastern region. I am advised by the ERHA that elective gynaecology work has been cancelled for the months of September and October at the National Maternity Hospital. I understand that this cancellation has resulted from a shortage of midwifes.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the ERHA and the hospital have made considerable efforts recently to recruit staff both at home and abroad. In this regard the hospital has been successful in recent weeks in employing additional nursing staff from Australia and India. In addition, the hospital intends to retain a number of pupil midwives who are due to qualify in the coming weeks. I am advised that in light of these developments, the position in relation to gynaecology services will be reviewed with a view to resuming elective work in November. In the interim, the ERHA is examining the possibility of providing some gynaecology procedures at alternative hospital sites in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the board that the mammography equipment in question was purchased in 1997 by the Friends of Cavan Hospital.

I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad trust of its recommendations. However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I have recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, to be chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services.

The Deputy should be aware that St. Joseph's service, while located on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital, is a specific service providing a range of day and residential services for persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>Many persons with an intellectual disability were admitted to inappropriate facilities such as psychiatric hospitals in the past due to a lack of suitable services. My Department is currently engaged in a major capital programme which has, as one of its main objectives, the transfer of such persons to more appropriate services. In this regard, £13 million is being made available for the development of new and refurbished facilities for persons with an intellectual disability currently accommodated in St. Ita's Hospital. This plan is being jointly funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department. As part of this project new residential and day services have been completed in Oldtown, County Dublin and are currently being commissioned. This new facility will provide accommodation for 30 persons from the St. Ita's campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An overall development control plan, which includes new accommodation to be provided for the intellectual disability services, is at an <Col N="1016" /> advanced planning stage. It is expected that construction will begin on this project towards the end of the first quarter of 2001.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the steps he proposes to take to deal with the situation where the life expectancy in Ireland is the lowest of all the 15 EU countries and the biggest issue in relation to the inequality in health is that between the rich and poor.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cardiovascular disease, cancer and accidents are the major causes of premature death in Ireland. A range of measures in place to reduce mortality and morbidity from these and other causes. In keeping with the principle of equity &ndash; one of the key principles of the national health strategy &ndash; many of these measures have a specific focus on improving the health status of people in lower socio-economic groups.denise.</P>
      <P>At age 65, Ireland has the lowest life expectancy in the EU with the single biggest contributor being heart disease. When the cardiovascular health strategy was launched in July last year, my Department set a medium-term objective  &ndash; to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. Our longer term objective is to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
      <P>The challenge now is to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy group by developing structures and mechanisms which promote cardiovascular health, reduce inequalities, ensure a high quality of service provision and reduce variations in access to and quality of services. A sum of £12 million has been provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals in implementing the various actions set out in the strategy.</P>
      <P>The national cancer strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%. Funding, totalling £40 million to date, has been invested in a range of service developments under the strategy, to the benefit of all, including in particular those socio-economic groups at a greater relative risk of contracting cancer due to environmental or lifestyle factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national health promotion strategy for the years 2000-05 supports and complements both the cardiovascular and cancer strategy recommendations. It specifically highlights the impact that socio-economic factors have on population health. There is clearly a need for a greater inter-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach to address these external and structural determinants of health. The new health promotion strategy is calling for a more comprehensive policy of <Col N="1017" />&ldquo;health proofing&rdquo; to ensure that the determinants of health, beyond the remit of health services are dealt with. This action will contribute to narrowing the gap between lower and higher socio-economic groups with respect to attaining maximum physical, mental and social well-being.</P>
    <P>International research has found that there are large differentials in mortality and morbidity between the higher and lower socio-economic groups and the conclusions from this research are that health inequalities are primarily a consequence of material differences in living standards. Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral collaboration is required to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative is aimed at ensuring that no adult has to wait longer than 12 months and no child longer that six months for access to an acute public hospital procedure. The achievement of these targets, which is being pursued through the implementation of a comprehensive set of short, medium and longer term measures, would represent an important improvement in access to care for those in the lower socio-economic groups, and others relying on public hospital services.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas.  Although health or health targets were not included in the original NAPS targets, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual workplans for NAPS.</P>
    <P>The new partnership agreement the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, contains a commitment to update the national anti poverty strategy and review the underlying methodology, existing targets and consider new targets such as health. My Department is already engaged in establishing the necessary structures to support a wide ranging consultation process and a working group on health. The objective is to produce an agreed final report which will identify potential health targets, health inequalities and associated outcomes including policy measures and performance indicators.  As I stated at the health inequalities conference in Cork last May, I am committed to working in an open and constructive manner to develop a health related dimension to the national anti poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The poverty proofing of policies will be independently reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council with a view to strengthening that process. Following this review, poverty proofing will be extended on a phased basis to local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for health services for 2000 excluding capital is almost £4 billion. This represents a substantial increase of just over one-third over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to pro<Col N="1018" /> vide a high quality health service directed at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-06 represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. This investment will provide a physical infra-structure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will be a significant ingredient in improving the mortality and morbidity of the poorest groups in our society.</P>
    <P>The ability of a society to create and maintain an environment which supports its people in attaining the highest level of health compatible with their natural endowment is one of the key indicators of the stage of development of a society and is recognised as such by its inclusion in the UN's list of human development indicators. Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion. It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in the context of revised NAPS targets, NDP funding, and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, established the Medical Manpower Forum in May, 1998. The forum has been endeavouring to reach a consensus on the issues involved. At this time the main service, training, research and career issues, and the principles and approaches to be adopted have, to a large measure, been agreed by the medical manpower forum. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This is necessary if one of the key principles of the forum is to be achieved, that is, the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals. Final discussions on the forum's first report have yet to be completed. While the forum has not met in formal plenary session since 24 February 2000, outstanding issues have been addressed in the meantime on a bilateral basis with some of the key groups represented at the forum. Based on these discussions I am confident that we can reach an early resolution of remaining issues and re-convene the forum shortly to finalise and formally adopt its report.</P>

      <P>The data is derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system which covers all hospitalisation in publicly-funded acute hospitals. All hospital discharges recording a diagnosis of poisoning by paracetamol type analgesics are included in the following table. Poisoning from other similar analgesics, such as acetanilid and phenacetin, also form part of this category but numbers are not likely to be significant. Figures in the table should not be taken to represent numbers of individual patients since persons hospitalised several times during the year for the same condition will be counted separately in the statistics.</P>
      <P>The table also indicates the presence of a liver condition for those cases with a diagnosis of paracetamol type poisoning. Caution should be used in interpreting these figures since it is not possible to determine whether a given liver condition is pre-existing and-or related to paracetamol poisoning.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the research findings suggest that there may be an increased risk of lung cancer for people living near high voltage power lines because of pollutant particles from car exhausts receiving an electrical charge making them more likely to adhere to a persons lungs if ingested.</P>
      <P>A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields surrounding power lines. The general body of scientific evidence has not conclusively established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, while it has not been possible to determine a definite link neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship. For this reason it is, in my view, extremely prudent that we should take all such reports very seriously and continue to carefully examine them.

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The placement of a resident in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Accordingly, my Department has no function in relation to the setting of private nursing home fees.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Emissions factors for carbon monoxide, CO, nitrogen oxides, NOx, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs, for vehicles, classified by category &ndash; passenger car, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles and motorcycles &ndash; by size of engine and by emissions control technology applicable at the time of first entry into service, are set out in tables C-5 to C-7 of Emissions to Air 1990-1998 &ndash; Estimation Methods, Trends and Challenges, EPA, 2000. Copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that any estimation of the changes in emissions arising from the conversion of the vehicle fleet in whole or in part to liquefied petroleum gas or compressed natural gas is complex. It is recognised, nevertheless, that a greater pen<Col N="1027" /> etration of these fuels has the potential to reduce emissions of certain pollutants. As regards CO2, the main greenhouse gas emission from transport, more significant reductions would be expected from a conversion to CNG rather than LPG.</P>
    <P>The capital cost of conversion of a car from petrol or diesel to gas is a commercial matter between the service provider and the customer.</P>
    <P>I am committed to promoting the use of environmentally clean fuels and my Department liaises with the Departments of Finance and Public Enterprise in this regard. In budget 1999 the Minister for Finance reduced the VAT inclusive excise duty of LPG by 1.8p per litre. There is no excise duty on CNG.</P>

      <P>Under special arrangements introduced in 1998, the first £2,000 of payments under the rural environment protection scheme is disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50% for meanstested social assistance purposes. In addition, any costs incurred by farmers in implementing the agri-environmental plan, as provided for under REPS, are also offset against other income from farming activities. These arrangements, which apply to farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age non-contributory pension, were extended to the farm assist scheme in early 1999.</P>
      <P>The above disregards also apply to payments arising under the scheme of compensation for compliance with special areas of conservation conditions, which is operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These revised arrangements provide low <Col N="1028" /> income farmers with a significant financial incentive to participate in the REPS and SAC schemes, thereby benefiting the environment by the improvement of the sustainability of agriculture through the preservation and enhancement of the rural environment.</P>
    <P>The forest premium scheme is designed to replace farm income which is foregone through the change in the use of the land from ordinary farming activities to forestry. Unlike REPS and compensation payments under SACs, which compensate farmers for the material and work involved in complying with the agri-environmental plans or SAC conditions, payments under the farm forest premium scheme would equate to other forms of farm income. Accordingly, payments under the forest premium scheme are treated in the same way as other forms of farm income and are assessable for means-tested social welfare purposes, for example, income from ordinary farm activities, headage payments, etc.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the farm assist scheme last year, farm income, including payments under the forest premium scheme, is now assessed on a more favourable basis. This was 80% when the scheme was introduced and has now been to reduced to 70% with effect from the start of October.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, there are no plans to extend the current disregards applying to REPS payments to payments under the forest premium scheme for meanstested social welfare purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fuel schemes are different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly.</P>
      <P>The fuel scheme is a means-tested payment which is not age-related. The free schemes, on the other hand, are mainly provided to pensioners, in many cases without a means test.</P>
      <P>The conditions that apply to the national fuel scheme require that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the living alone condition. A person is not disqualified if they are living with a person or persons in a number of specified categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a pensioner resides with a brother or sister of pension age who does not qualify for a <Col N="1030" /> social welfare pension in their own right, the household will still qualify for a fuel allowance if the standard fuel allowance means test is satisfied. The weekly income limit for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, plus £30, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children and living alone allowance, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance, and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>The other free schemes are available to people living alone, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>Budget 2000 made provision for the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes will be extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures are being implemented this month.</P>
    <P>With regard to people under the age of 75, the free schemes are already available to low-income pensioners people who are not in receipt of a social welfare pension and who satisfy the same means test as applies in the case of fuel allowance, described above, provided that they satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A brother or sister of someone in receipt of a social welfare pension would not disqualify the household for receipt of a free electricity/natural gas allowance and free television licence, if their income is such that they would qualify for the schemes in their own right.</P>
    <P>However, to satisfy the living alone condition for the purpose of the free telephone allowance, the brother or sister of the applicant would need to be providing the applicant and/or another member of the household with constant care and attention. Medical evidence would be required in respect of the person(s) being cared for.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the free telephone rental allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, the question of aligning the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance and free schemes has to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    <P>Any such changes would have cost implications that would have to be weighed against other competing expenditure priorities in this area.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Donadea Castle is a recorded national monument and therefore is afforded legal protection under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. Under section 12(3) of this Act, the owner or occupier must give two months written notice to my Department of any proposals to carry out work at this site.</P>

      <P>The national heritage plan, which is currently being prepared by my Department, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership. This approach will include the use of the planning and development Acts, the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage and increased levels of training in skills and craft areas which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership.</P>
      <P>I might point out that owners of heritage properties may receive assistance under the conservation grants scheme announced last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and also under the provisions of the Finance Act in respect of maintenance works carried out to heritage properties which are open to the public.</P>

      <P>Work on the restoration of ground and first floors at Maynooth Castle is proceeding and I expect the project, including the provision of exhibitions, to be completed towards <Col N="1033" /> the end of this year or early in 2001. The priority once this is complete will be the provision of toilet facilities for both the general public and any guides who may be based at the site once it is open to the public. Officials of my Department are to meet in the near future with representatives of the Maynooth College authorities to try and determine an appropriate location for these facilities. Provision of toilet facilities is essential if the castle is to open to the public in summer of 2001.</P>
      <P>The total investment for these projects is estimated at £1.5 million, of which £234,215 was expended to the end of August 2000, and this heritage site will be extensively marketed as part of the many heritage attractions managed by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the rise in the number of incidents of domestic violence. It is apparent that domestic violence incidents have, in the past, been under reported. Possibly the increase in reported domestic violence incidents may be attributed to the increased awareness by victims of the support services available to them in times of crisis. This awareness has been created, in part, by the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The committee has funded two major public awareness campaigns, as part of a national strategy to highlight available services and as part of a policy to let the victim know that help is available. The campaign also aimed to make society aware that they should support the victim and not condone such violence and to get the message across to perpetrators that this is a crime and that it must stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that <Col N="1036" /> they have a written policy on domestic violence intervention. As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda Síochána also has a special domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit, which is staffed by highly trained gardaí. In 1997 the unit was given a national role and it now collates all incidents of domestic violence in the State. I understand that the unit also has a very good relationship with the voluntary agencies working in this field.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increase in domestic violence incidents, I understand that the Garda Commissioner has indicated previously that part of this may be due to changes in classification of incidents as domestic violence incidents rather than assaults. There are complex issues involved which explain why many cases do not result in a conviction. I am aware, for example, that in many cases, what the victim wants is for the violence to end and they do not seek a conviction. Where cases are pursued, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter for the courts to decide and, mindful of the independence of the courts, it would not be proper for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>At a meeting on 29 June 2000 the national steering group on deaths in prison examined the circumstances of the tragic death in Wheatfield Place of Detention referred to by the Deputy. The group found that there were no major omissions in the prisoner's care and that all that could have been done was done.</P>
      <P>As I have told the House on previous occasions, there are elaborate strategies in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons, however, unless there is to be a total denial of all personal privacy to all prisoners at all times the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be prevented no more than it can be prevented in the wider community. It is impossible to prevent all suicides or suicide attempts, all that can be done is to reduce the risk.</P>
      <P>In a recent development the Irish Prisons Service issued a tender for a research project on self harm and suicide in custodial settings. It is hoped that this project will contribute to further proposals for preventive strategies, when it is completed.</P>
      <P>The national steering group on deaths in custody have continued to meet on a regular basis. This provides a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups and to disseminate significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system. The group also organises an annual forum of the local suicide awareness groups. The first such forum took place in October 1999 and the second is proposed for November this year.</P>

      <P>On 14 September 2000, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. The creation of this group is in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The Government is providing for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006 aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. The first instalment will be paid to eligible students early in 2001.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that I expect some 10,000 students to benefit from this measure. This is a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference specifically require that it advise me, inter alia, on the identification and tracking of the target groups. The action group will advise on the operational details of the measure and, in the meantime, it is not necessary for grant holders to apply for the special rate of maintenance grant. Once details have been finalised, arrangements will be made by my Department to ensure all qualifying grant holders are placed on the special rate of maintenance grant.</P>

In the case of St. Patrick's post-primary school, an extension of 1,097 square metres and a refurbishment of the school have been approved.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the three post primary schools in Naas, following the completion of building projects at each, will meet the required number of second level places in the centre. However, the area will continue to be closely monitored by my Department to ensure any emerging additional requirements are addressed.</P>

      <P>A number of tax reliefs are available for fees paid for third level education. The Finance Act, 1995, provides for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students attending private third level colleges. Such students or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed codes of standards and are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years and followed in colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme or in colleges which satisfy the prescribed codes of standards.</P>
      <P>In the 1997 Finance Act provision was made to extend tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State. In relation to the above reliefs, the maximum level of qualifying fees is £2,500.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1999, extended tax relief to tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses in publicly funded universities or similar third level colleges in other EU member states. The courses must be of at least two years duration. In line with the provisions of the third level student support schemes, courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or teacher training do not qualify for the relief. The amount of tuition fees paid that qualifies for tax relief is the actual amount of such fees up to a maximum limit equivalent to IR£2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2000, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as fees paid in respect of approved postgraduate courses in approved private third level colleges here. This relief, at the standard rate of tax, will be available to full-time <Col N="1050" /> and part-time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and application forms to claim tax relief on tuition fees are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
