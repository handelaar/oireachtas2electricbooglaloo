      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies John Bruton, Joe Higgins and Sargent. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hereby seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider an urgent matter, namely, the failure of Deputy Lawlor, until recently a member of the ethics committee of the Dáil, to attend a hearing of a tribunal of inquiry established by the Dáil to answer a set of questions set out on the public record yesterday by counsel for the tribunal and, therefore, while having due regard to the prerogatives of the tribunal as recognised in Standing Orders, but also in recognition of the Dáil's jurisdiction over its Members, call on Deputy Lawlor to comply fully with the terms of the invitation he has received from the tribunal and to appear forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a vital matter of urgent public importance, namely, the failure of a Member of the Dáil, Deputy Lawlor, to attend, as requested, the tribunal into certain planning matters established by Dáil Éireann, the consequent undermining of the ability of the tribunal to comprehensively investigate alleged corruption in the planning process in County Dublin, and the contempt shown to the majority of citizens who wish the tribunal to establish the full truth in the matters it is investigating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to discuss the failure of Deputy Lawlor to appear at the Flood tribunal and the need for the House to make the necessary changes to Standing Orders to ensure Members who show such contempt for a tribunal <Col N="1534" /> of inquiry established by Dáil Éireann can be suspended from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 31. I cannot grant leave, therefore, to move the motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification as to how within Standing Orders the Dáil may exercise its jurisdiction with regard to the privileges of Members other than by means of either a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or by motion in the House, both of which you have denied, or is it the case that the Dáil ceases to have jurisdiction over its Members once a tribunal is established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the Deputy to ask questions on the matter. We will proceed to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point of order which I am addressing to you as the arbiter of order in the House. Does the Dáil have jurisdiction over its Members in so far as the abuse or use of their privileges is concerned and, if so, how can we exercise it other than by means of either a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or by motion in the House, both of which you have denied, or is it the case that once a tribunal is established the Dáil ceases to have jurisdiction over its Members in regard to any of the matters covered by a tribunal? That is not constitutional, bearing in mind that it was the Dáil which established the tribunal which is constitutionally subordinate to the Dáil, not the other way around.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 31 is not a motion. The Deputy should give notice of any other questions of that nature. I have explained the position regarding the motion fully in my letter to the Chief Whips. We will now proceed to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which seems to imply that a motion may be taken by the House to consider whether a Member of the House is acting in accordance with the standards the House would <Col N="1535" /> expect of its Members, is it the intention of the Government to propose a motion expressing the House's concern that Deputy Lawlor should appear before the Flood tribunal to answer questions placed on the public record yesterday by counsel for the tribunal bearing in mind that as a Member of the House which established the tribunal he, like everyone of us, has an obligation to be seen to comply with the orders of the House in regard to the powers of the tribunal and to co-operate fully with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my colleagues anticipated that you would so rule in respect of Standing Order 31, which is why we did not seek to adjourn the House to debate this matter. We think a debate would be improper. I wrote to the leaders of the various parties and the Independent Deputies seeking that a motion would be taken without debate, expressing our displeasure as Members of the House at what has happened and calling on Deputy Lawlor to either attend the tribunal or to resign forthwith from the House.</P>
      <P>The Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, received that request in writing last night and had notice from me to that effect. As it his prerogative to order the business of the House, why has the Taoiseach seen fit not to include such a motion? It could be taken without debate and not interrupt the business of the House. It would leave it unambiguous to the rest of the nation how we, as elected Members of the House, feel about the behaviour of one Member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach indicate what he considers to be a proper response by him and the Dáil to the contempt that Deputy Lawlor has shown to the people, who wish their public representatives to answer the questions that arise with regard to planning irregularities in Dublin and who wish to see alleged nefarious practices investigated, the full <Col N="1536" /> truth established and the planning process removed from those who would corrupt it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Flood tribunal was established by the unanimous will of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In his letter last night, for which I thank him, Deputy Quinn reminded me of this. Every citizen and every Member of the Oireachtas has a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders. I would expect any citizen and Member of the Oireachtas who disputes the validity or legality of any tribunal order to make his or her case to the tribunal and, if necessary, to the courts.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has been informed that under the 1997 Act, the jurisdiction of the High Court is being invoked today by the tribunal to compel the compliance of Deputy Lawlor with its orders. I do not want to put at risk any of the remedies that have been initiated or are available to the tribunal under the 1997 Act. The House foresaw that issue when we debated the legislation, when we included a provision in the 1997 Act to the effect that if anybody did not comply with the orders there was a legal basis for the chairman of the tribunal to seek such compliance. We gave the tribunal that power.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation introduced by the Government and agreed by the House, anybody can be compelled without criminal proceedings and by a fast track process to obey the lawful orders of the tribunal. As I understand this process will commence today I propose to say nothing further. I also understand that the DPP will have received a criminal complaint on the matter and I cannot comment further for obvious reasons other than to make the political point that it is our strong view that there is an obligation on Members and every citizen to fully co-operate with the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach was given and took the opportunity to say what he has said. It is a very important statement on the requirement on Members of the House to comply with the orders of the tribunal. I hope that as a result of what the Taoiseach said, Deputy Lawlor will take the sensible, correct and democratic course and appear before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the response of the Taoiseach. The eyes of the nation are looking at this House and how we conduct our affairs in public. There is a simple remedy to the Members of the House to express their views unambiguously and unanimously. This especially applies to Members on the Government side who control the Order of Business, decide its contents and who could have put a resolution of the kind expressed by the Taoiseach on the Order Paper. That could have been decided without debate so <Col N="1537" /> as not to prejudice any proceedings in any other part of the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>However, the Taoiseach has chosen not to so do. As a result, everybody in this House is devalued in the eyes of this democracy. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or for anybody who stands for election to this House. I ask the Taoiseach and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if it still exists as a republican party, to assert the primacy of this Assembly and uphold the dignity of people who stand for election, who make laws and must abide by them. I implore the Taoiseach to reconsider the matter and do the right thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Standing Orders of the House can be decided by the House? If so, how is it that Deputy Lawlor is still present in the Chamber when it is the overwhelming view of the people that he should be suspended until such time as he is involved with and attends the Flood tribunal. Is that not the case, and, if not, when can we amend Standing Orders to achieve that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was concern that holding a debate on this matter might prejudice Deputy Lawlor's rights, but given that he has said he would welcome a debate, would the Taoiseach not agree that the House should have a debate because the overwhelming majority of Deputies want Deputy Lawlor to appear before the Flood tribunal and if he does not appear they want him to explain himself? They want standards to be <Col N="1538" /> applied to Members of the House in the same way as they are applied to ordinary citizens. There are not two laws in this country, one for Deputies and one for ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking the Government to amend the Order of Business to allow that to occur. There is nothing in Standing Orders to prevent that occurring. I challenge the interpretation of Standing Order 56, which was introduced as late as 1996 to prevent the Chair from ruling such requests out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking for the Government side, even later today, to allow the House to endorse in the form of a resolution, without debate, what the Taoiseach has already put on the record. I do not take the carrot offered from the backbenches of Fianna Fáil that we might hold a debate. That may well prejudice the outcome of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House debated the legislation it put in place the procedures that allow the tribunal to deal with those who do not appear before it or who do not follow the orders it has laid down. Under that legislation any person can be compelled without criminal proceedings by a fast track process to obey the lawful orders of the tribunal. I will not get into the business of putting at risk those remedies which have been initiated. I have been advised that those remedies are being moved today both in the High Court and with the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is the way to proceed and to achieve an adequate resolution of this matter. I have indicated the Government's view on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a formal request to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business. Is the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats prepared to put in the form of a motion the words he has just uttered so that this House can endorse the sentiments so ably expressed by himself which would leave the public in no doubt about how we feel inside the Chamber? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a request that the words the Taoiseach has uttered on behalf of the Government could be formulated in a motion which can be endorsed by every Member of this House without debate so as not to prejudice proceedings anywhere else. I invite the Taoiseach to bring forward such a motion either later today or tomorrow morning. Failure to do so leaves us all open to the accusation that there is one law for citizens and another law for Members.</P>

      <P>Given that the Government seems to have difficulty in either having a motion or a debate, will the Taoiseach agree to a joint statement of all party leaders along the lines of what he has just said? This could be formally issued and it would have the same force as a motion, although I hope it would be abided by in the same way as a motion, given that it has been agreed to by all the party leaders. Will the Taoiseach consider that and allow the Whips to discuss it? I am not asking for a decision on the matter now.</P>
      <P>Has the Government taken note of the fact that Mr. Justice Kelly intends to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of the Government in relation to the provision of a safe and secure place for a young person who is disturbed? Is the Taoiseach happy that such a situation should arise where the courts are, of their own initiative, investigating what is tantamount to maladministration by the Government in this matter? Does he intend to co-operate with this inquiry by Mr. Justice Kelly or does he have other proposals to deal with this serious issue affecting both the jurisdiction of the courts over public administration and the public administration of child care services by the Government? </P>

That review will be carried out by an independent person and will be completed before the end of the year. There have been building difficulties with the three high support units in Ballydowd. The Department of Health and Children and the health authority are working together to resolve these difficulties. It is anticipated that one of the eight bed units will be full by the end of November. It is important that this matter is investigated and that lessons are learned from it.</P>

While the two ambassadors who co-ordinated the immediate campaign, Ambassadors Ryan and Whelan, deserve special credit, it is undoubtedly the case that Ministers and diplomats who have enhanced and maintained Ireland's relationship with the United Nations and all its members over many years have contributed to this success. This is not just something that has happened in a short time. It represents a period of long-term enhancement of Ireland's prestige in the United Nations by means of participation in the United Nations. Irish troops who served overseas with the United Nations deserve much credit for this honour being bestowed upon us because if they were not willing to put their lives at risk in the way they did, the reputation of Ireland in the United Nations would not be as high as it obviously is.</P>

    <Title>National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost concluded my remarks when I moved the adjournment last week. I want to set out briefly my position on this Bill. While I am attracted to the underlying concept of setting up a pension fund which would supplement both public service and social welfare pensions, at a time in the future when it seems that there may be a difficulty in funding such pensions and a particular burden on the taxpayers, there are elements of the Bill which the Minister must clarify before I would be prepared to even support it on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There is now a reserve fund in place, arising from legislation we passed in this House a year ago, in which the bulk of the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann have been lodged. That reserve fund also contains the first two tranches of 1% of GNP, which is the formula being used to decide how much money will be lodged annually in the fund. The amount in the research fund is in excess of £5 billion and that will be added to each year by way of 1% of GNP being lodged in the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> Those are enormous amounts of money, amounts about which an Administration, even five years ago, could have only dreamed. While we are blasé now in times of surpluses, that has not been the financial pattern in this State. I was in Cabinets where Ministers debated and argued for a long time on the expenditure of £0.5 million or a few hundred thousand pounds on some occasions. Dealing with an amount of £10 million was a big decision. If one of those Cabinets was deciding on £10 million in cuts, that was a major decision. We are now making a decision that will tie our successors for the next 25 years by initially putting £5 billion into a fund and then requiring our successors to supplement it by annual tranches of amounts in excess of £600 million and rising as GNP rises. This is a decision of import. While there is no problem now in deducting £600 million from a surplus heading for £3 billion, if we return to balanced budgets or if when the business cycle changes we go into deficits, the setting aside of such a vast amount becomes a serious political decision as well as a serious financial one. The choice in the future may be between putting £600 million into a pension fund or closing down a hospital to provide that money, having no social welfare increase or cutting back on child benefit or have further lengthening waiting lists in hospitals or not building a school that is required. I have no doubt those hard political choices will face a future Government. The formula being used by the Minister is far too inflexible. He, as a Minister, like all of us were and hope to be again &ndash; birds of passage in Administrations that pass &ndash; purports to tie his successors for 25 years in respect of some aspects of the Bill and for 55 years in respect of other aspects of it. The timeframe is very long.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on demographic projections made by the Minister, which he assures us will turn out as he predicts. All projections of any sort are based on a premise. I have seen the type of projections on which the Minister is basing his predictions. It is a given that, because we know what the population is now, we have a fair idea of the number of people in excess of 65 years of age there will be in the population in 25 years' time. We can make a rough estimate of that, but that is not the calculation on which this should be based. It must be based on the number of persons on social welfare pension and on public service pension in proportion to the active taxpaying labour force. That is the only way it makes sense. It is not possible as we enter the fifth or sixth year of an economic boom to project that with any accuracy. One would have different inputs and a different premise than applied in the case of calculations made four years ago.</P>
    <P>The most astounding development in this economy and the factor that explains almost everything else is that seven years ago there were more than 1 million at work, now 1.7 million are at work. A little over an extra 600,000 people are now in the labour force. They are trying to establish a stake in the country. They are building <Col N="1547" /> houses, buying cars and getting credit because they are coming from schools or colleges or off social welfare or are immigrants and do not have other resources. That explains a good deal of the consumer boom and much of the pressure in the economy. Given that is happening, there is a large base of young workers paying tax. That is evident from PRSI receipts and tax receipts. Much of the additional tax and PRSI receipts do not accrue because people are paying extra tax and PRSI but because substantially more people are paying tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>Our population has increased by approximately 40,000. Immigration is running at the level of 26,000 or 27,000 people a year. If one takes an immigration figure of 30,000 people a year and projects it forward for 25 years, that would give a figure of 750,000 people. Because of the nature of immigrants, they come into the labour force at a young and active age. I would like the Minister to justify his projections when what he is proposing puts the handcuffs on subsequent Administrations and will force them into positions where they will have to make very difficult decisions if we enter a phase of deficit budgeting. The choice may be to close a hospital or reduce the efficacy of the health service because we decided to put away money for the rainy day. The rainy day may come but there may be no rainy day. I would like to hear the Minister's argument on this point.</P>
    <P>The formula is far too tight. I would much prefer a formula which gave discretion to the Administration of the day to put a sum of money into the fund over a range of contributions in accordance with fiscal circumstances if, for example, there was an absolute obligation to put 0.25% of GNP into that fund and that amount could be increased to 1.5% or 2% of GNP in times of major surpluses. At present there is no reason we could not put 2% of GNP into the fund. There is surplus revenue and it might as well be put into such a fund as used to clip down the size of our debt or for some other purpose. The surplus, effectively, is not being used at present.  The requirement to make stated investments in this fund will be a very serious issue for subsequent Administrations. I know that anything that is passed by the Dáil can be repealed by it, but it would take a Minister for Finance with an awful lot of bottle to say he or she was standing down the pension fund because the revenue is needed elsewhere. That is the type of political decision that is nearly impossible to make. I would much prefer if a range of options were given in respect of the contribution.</P>
    <P>I have no problem about future receipts from the sale of State assets being put in the fund. That is a good idea. Such proceeds could be used for that purpose or to pay off our debt. The receipts of State assets should be considered to be spending money for pet projects as such receipts are the value of the asset owned by the people realised by the Exchequer. The value of that asset should be used for the people in general rather <Col N="1548" /> than for one project in one constitutency or for one item of current expenditure or capital investment. That is not the way to proceed. We should proceed along the lines suggested. I have no difficulty with that. I would like the Minister to justify what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Another area of difficulty is the prohibitions against investing any of the fund in Ireland. It is not put that way in the Bill, but the Bill stresses and the Minister reaffirmed that the investment must be made on strictly commercial criteria. I am advised by fund managers that investing here on the basis of strictly commercial criteria at present would mean that not more than 1% of the fund would be invested in Ireland. We are talking about a fund of £5 billion that would be increased in tranches each year having to be invested abroad. Two points arise from that. Investment of that fund in Japan, in the United States or elsewhere in Europe will provide jobs for persons of other nationalities. It will help to build up their infrastructure and capital stock, but of all the OECD countries and particularly of all the European Union countries, Ireland has the most depleted and run down infrastructure. These enormous amounts of money would be set aside in a pension fund and could not be spent in Ireland. The Minister has to re-examine this. I would like to hear his reflections on what regulations he intends to put in place to ensure that the fund is not invested in companies which the majority of our citizens would regard as being engaged in non-ethical practices. Irish pension fund money should not be used in the armament industry or in manufacturing land mines which blow people apart in sub-Saharan Africa. The Minister should clarify this in his reply and if I am not satisfied with the clarification I will seek a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enormously important debate, not just in the context of the House but of the broader public. It is a great pity we have not had greater public debate in the past year or so since the Minister announced his intentions. We have set aside almost £5 billion, which would have been our total GNP approximately 15 years ago, towards this fund and we are proposing to set aside over £600 million this year, with increasing amounts in future years. This is more than we spend on education, social welfare or the health services every year and it is an enormous amount of taxpayers' money. It is a pity we have had almost no public debate regarding the wisdom or otherwise of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not consulted more widely with the other political parties regarding the specific proposals in the Bill, as the Bill is obviously unique in its structure and in what it seeks to do. The Minister is making a statement of policy and putting legislation in place which binds not just his hands but the hands of Ministers for Finance for at least a quarter of a century and arguably up to half a century &ndash; 55 years. To that extent the Bill requires more than just a <Col N="1549" /> decision of the Government, it requires something close to consensus in the House and there is no such consensus.</P>
    <P>I supported the principle of the Bill when the temporary fund was set up last year and I still support the principle of the Bill today, but I do so with serious reservations. I will expand on some of those today and others on Committee Stage. Much of what we say in Opposition does not count for a great deal. Often we make debating points or oppose for the sake of opposition. However, my party and I wish to make clear that we will not be bound into the future by the specific provisions of this Bill. Some of those provisions are inadequate and others are plain wrong.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea. The principle of making provision for future liabilities is a good idea, but I am not prepared to say that in ten years time we will not see other priorities. I am not prepared even now to stand over a position where pensioners are living in poverty, yet we are taking taxpayers' money to ensure that in 25 years' time we will be able to make provision for pension liabilities. We have to strike a balance here. At present the choice is not a difficult one &ndash; we can make this provision and current day provision. However, in five, ten or 15 years, circumstances may be different. We will attempt to work this Bill and work the structure. We support the principle of the Bill and we wish to make provision for future liabilities, but if hard choices have to be made in five, ten or 15 years' time I am not making a commitment that people in the roles of the Minister or Deputy Noonan will be able to say that my party bought into this. We bought into this with reservations and on conditions which I will spell out today and on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>So far the creation of this fund has been relatively painless. We have taken £650 million out of Government revenues this year and will take more next year, with the figure increasing as GNP grows. Just what that money would have been spent on this year is difficult to tell, as the Government is ideologically committed to capping investment in services. As I said, I accept the principle of provision for future liabilities, but I do not accept that all is rosy in the garden. Are we really saying we are happy with the state of our health services now &ndash; not in five years time, but now? Are we happy with the level of investment in education and transport? Even more to the point, are we happy with the current level of pension provision to today's pensioners?</P>
    <P>This fund is one of the proposals made by the National Pensions Policy Initiative, which was set up by the previous Government. The establishment of the fund was just one of a series of proposals made by the pensions board at the time and many of the other proposals have yet to be acted upon by the Government. Most important is the failure so far to bring forward proposals on the portability of pensions. The Government has said time and again that it is committed to <Col N="1550" /> allowing people to carry their pensions from job to job, but so far we have seen no Bill or action relating to this. This is becoming more important year after year as people change jobs more frequently in the course of their working lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know that the NPPI spent a lot of time trying to get to grips with the problem of pensioner poverty, often, it has to be said, with little assistance from the Minister's Department, which seems unwilling to commit to any level of provision, but it concluded after a great deal of debate that a State pension of approximately 34% of the average industrial wage is needed to prevent pensioners from falling into poverty. We should emphasise that stipulation, that is what is needed to stop pensioners from falling into poverty, not to ensure a good life or to ensure a provision we would be proud of or which pensioners would be happy to receive. That would amount to approximately £108 per week in current terms and the Government has so far failed to meet that target.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish not to acknowledge that in terms of sheer volume increases the Minister for Finance has added a decent amount to the level of the pension by comparison with five, ten or 15 years ago. Unfortunately, it is also true to say that despite the economic boom the Government has still not managed to match the rate of increase in industrial wages. The reality is that despite those increases, percentage or actual, pensioners, as a group in our population, are relatively worse off than when the Government came to power. Given the economic boom, that is intolerable. We are talking about approximately one third of a million people who are not living month to month or week to week but probably for 20 years on £96 per week. No Member would attempt to suggest that is a decent amount of money to live on in a given week. It might provide for the frugal standard of living many pensioners choose or have forced upon them, but what happens if the fridge breaks down or some slates are dislodged from the roof? We all know that level of income is not sufficient. Perhaps 20 years ago when people lived to 71 or 72 they could live with that, but with increased life expectancy people are required to live on this level of income for 20 to 25 years and that is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and we should not ask them to buy it anymore. We must understand the fundamental change that has occurred and not ask people to buy an argument which is out of date and does not wash. That is the fundamental issue. It is fundamentally unfair to set aside money to fund pensioners in a quarter of a century if the current level of pensions is simply inadequate. How can we ask taxpayers to set aside tax moneys to cater for future generations if their own parents are living in poverty? When I say &ldquo;living in poverty&rdquo;, I do not use a definition I have just made up but one on which all parties are agreed, which the Pensions Board has published and which has been accepted by Government. We cannot and should not do this. We must ensure that adequate provision is made for today's pensioners before we make provision for the pensioners of tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Having settled on the basic level of payment, we must then decide on a mechanism for increasing it. In his Second Stage contribution last week, the Minister referred to the debate in the United Kingdom about whether they should seek to index link pensions with the rate of increase in wages. The case in terms of equity is certainly open and shut. Having set the level of pensions, we must seek to maintain it by a formal link to wage increases. I do not look at this through rose tinted glasses. I accept the point that, in times of difficulty, that could prove to be onerous. However, surely that argument cannot be made now in times of plenty.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister is entitled to ask what this has to do with the establishment of the fund. In a sense, it has everything and nothing to do with it. It has nothing to do with it so long as we can afford to make provision for today's pensioners out of current revenues, but it has everything to do with it as long as we have to make a choice between making provision for current pensioners and future pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> As Deputy Noonan said, the argument extends well beyond the net issue of pensions. It could equally be applied to the health service. Between 1987 and 1989, Fianna Fáil in Government made severe cutbacks in the health service. We are now, ten or 12 years later, only getting around to reversing some of them. It is all very well to say we are happy to set aside 1% of GNP now, but would we be just as willing to do that if we had to impose cuts in the health service to make the books balance? I do not want to anticipate what a successor of mine might say faced with that choice in future, but it does not require much insight to make an intelligent guess.</P>
    <P>What would happen if we were faced with a situation which has applied for most of the past 30 years where we were required to borrow money to invest it? In pure, simple economic terms we are borrowing money at 8%, 9% or 10% and investing it at a return of 5%, 6% or 7%. We are borrowing money at a higher rate of interest to invest at a lower rate of interest. We are losing money in the process. In pure economic terms, that would be completely daft and I am not willing to commit my party to do that into the future.</P>
    <P>Before going any further, I would like to say a few words about the basic premise which has brought us to this point. An actuarial study was carried out by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to facilitate the NPPI. Virtually all the findings relating to the birth rate, immigration, the labour force and the cost of pensions relative to GNP are now hopelessly out of date and have not stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance produced an interesting paper called the long-term issues group paper in December 1998 which looked up to a half century into the future and dealt specifically with the issue of pensions. It is interesting and, at the time, represented a good stab at predicting the future. A few years later, it is worth looking at just to establish how fragile even short-term forecasts can be. The paper assumes a level of labour force which is out by about 200,000. It also assumes levels of economic growth for the past three years from 1997 to 2000 averaging 6% whereas the average growth was about 50% higher than that. This is a paper which dates from just a few years ago and the projections it makes are already, unfortunately, hopelessly out of date. I do not blame anyone for that. I simply point to the fragility and unpredictability of many of the economic factors which are central to this argument.</P>
    <P>One can still make an argument that the dependency rate in 2025 and into the future is likely to change and could change dramatically and very quickly. The point is that we need to keep this under constant review. To be able to state that we are confident about what the dependency rate will be in 25 years' time has simply no reality. It will almost certainly not happen that way. We need to be in a position in five or ten years time <Col N="1553" /> to take a different view, draw different conclusions and do things differently.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the mandate of the fund and the way in which it is to be managed. The Bill is surprisingly and shockingly silent on this issue. The only mandate of the fund is to make as much money as possible and the only restriction is that it cannot invest in Irish Government bonds. This is hopelessly inadequate and is not in keeping with experience elsewhere. The mandate of the fund should be set by the Oireachtas and the rules should be agreed between the Minister and the commission.</P>
    <P>There are many obvious issues involved. One is whether the fund is to be actively or passively managed. I know the Norwegian petroleum fund is up to 80% passively managed and the results appear to be generally positive. The impression I received from listening to the Minister during his Second Stage contribution is that he sees active management, albeit not within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We must examine a basic economic question. Even accepting the projections in the long-term issues paper, we will have a national debt for another 20 to 25 years at least. That will cost us money. We make interest repayments at a rate of 6% or 7% and perhaps a little less than that as things stand. Does it make sense to borrow money in future at a higher rate? Does it make sense, for that matter, to invest money and receive a lesser return while at the same time repaying debt?</P>
    <P>Let me spell it out even more clearly. If we invest money in this fund and it is passively managed by being put on deposit, we will receive a return of 4% or 5%. I am no expert in these matters and the Minister has more actuarial experience or experience as an accountant, so perhaps he is in a better position to tell us, but it is likely that we are repaying more in terms of our national debt. Does it make sense to be taking money that could be used to pay off the debt and putting it into a fund where we are actually losing money? This is a central argument in terms of the economics and the good sense of the whole procedure. As Deputy Noonan said, there is an obligation on the Minister on Committee Stage to spell out the economics, to show us the actual repayments we will make towards the national debt, to project the likely return on the investment in the fund and to make the sums add up. If the sums do not add up, we should not be doing it, whatever about the principle of it in the first place.</P>
    <P>We also need to know, as Deputy Noonan also said, whether the fund will be entitled to invest in Irish equities. I know the argument has been made elsewhere, and the Minister was obviously taken by it, that the fund would have a disproportionate capacity to distort the Irish stock market if it were permitted to invest in Irish equities. I can see that there is some argument in that.</P>
    <P>I recall saying in conversation with a senior official in the Department of Finance not too long ago that I saw this as a wonderful means of <Col N="1554" /> nationalising by the back door. Just at the time when the Labour Party was moving away from nationalisation as an ideological principle, the Minister had suddenly presented us with a wonderful opportunity to acquire 10% or 15% in virtually every PLC on the stock market in Ireland. The fund is not for that purpose and should not be used for that purpose and, therefore, I accept the general argument that we should not use the fund to influence the management or ownership of Irish PLCs. Apart from anything else, it opens up the possibility that political pressure would be brought to bear on the fund, fund managers or Ministers to act in a certain way in the interests of a certain company or in terms of making specific acquisitions. That is something which should be avoided. That said, we should not say that there should be absolutely no investment in Irish equities. There is scope for some investment of that nature.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises is whether the capacity will exist to invest in other pension funds in Ireland. A great deal of Irish money is caught up in other pension funds and I would be interested to hear whether the Minister foresees that this fund would have the capacity to invest in other pension funds or whether he sees himself prohibiting that by way of regulation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is the issue to which Deputy Noonan also alluded of whether there would be ethical constraints on what the fund could do and my strong view and that of my party is that there must be. These should be set down in legislation and should at least be part of regulations which have the force of law. It would be intolerable if Irish taxpayers' money were to be invested, directly or indirectly, in the arms industry. It makes no sense for Irish foreign policy, no doubt now articulated at the level of the Security Council, to be pushing in one direction if Irish taxpayers' money is being used to achieve exactly the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>If the fund is given a totally commercial mandate, it is conceivable and even likely that the moneys it contains will be invested in the arms trade because arms companies are among the most profitable in the world. This possibility should be firmly closed off by legislation or regulation. The same possibility arises in relation to the tobacco industry. It makes no sense for the Government to pursue an active policy of discouraging smoking if we are investing in the unscrupulous industry which makes it all happen.</P>
    <P>A serious issue of governance arises here. The Bill seeks to appoint commissioners, the general management of the fund is the responsibility of the NTMA and that organisation may, in turn, seek to set aside parts of the fund to certain fund managers. The NTMA may seek to farm out certain parts of the fund for management by particular fund managers. It strikes me as rather cumbersome to have several different layers of management. Apart from that, it also blurs the lines of accountability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> We are discussing a great deal of taxpayers' money and the Oireachtas is entitled to know how that money is being spent or invested. In that context, a direct responsibility for reporting should be placed not on the Minister but on the director of the NTMA. We need to know what is happening and those operating the fund must be accountable to the Dáil for the way the money is being spent. There must also be firm rules governing how the money is to be used. Effectively, these are commercial decisions but there are also other ethical considerations. I do not believe they would change from week to week or year to year but they must be clear because people need to know what is being done with their money.</P>
    <P>There are two specific proposals to which I alluded last year in relation to what the Labour Party believes could be productively done with this money. I accept that once the money is put aside and the capital sum is secure it must remain secure. However, that does not mean it cannot be used in the intervening 25 or more years for productive purposes within our economy. I refer here to the role it could play in respect of public private partnerships. The Government has committed itself, at least in principle, to the notion that it will co-operate with the private sector to effect infrastructural changes and improvements. That is a welcome development because progress in that area has been far too slow and we must improve the way we deal with it.</P>
    <P>The traditional way of doing things involves the mantra of &ldquo;design, build, operate, finance&rdquo;. The presumption has been that the finance element would be part of the private sector input. We must reconsider the position and examine the possibility that infrastructural projects could be part or wholly financed by the public sector, while the private sector's expertise could be used in relation to some of the other issues to which I referred, namely, taking some of the risk in terms of designing, operating, etc. This system would have to operate on a commercial basis but, as already stated, the money would be available to part or fully finance PPPs with the assumption that there would be a stream of income and that the capital would be returned over a period of ten to 15 years. While the money is being put to productive use during that period, the capital sum would have been secured and increased in the long-term. Consideration must be given to this matter and it could be done by way of some sort of Exchequer bond, some kind of straight borrowing or any class of strategic partnership which might seem appropriate to particular projects.</P>
    <P>This money could also prove useful in respect of the intervention currently required in the provision of building land. The principle is simple: the capital sum must be in place when required in the future. However, there is no reason a proportion of the moneys currently available in the fund could not be given to a building agency or local authorities thereby entitling them to intervene and purchase building land in order to free <Col N="1556" /> it up, by way of compulsory purchase or otherwise. As it stands, everyone acknowledges there is a difficulty in freeing up development land and the State could, using the moneys to which I refer, perform a useful role in that regard.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5 billion or £6 billion would allow us to take the course to which I refer in any event, but I am not suggesting that we simply nationalise all the building land in the country. However, encouraging the State to become involved as a player through an agency or through local authorities will help to free up the market and may help to bring more land on stream, even in the short-term. The principle is that the State should not seek to retain this land, it should dispose of it at a reasonable commercial price to builders, local authorities and voluntary bodies in order to have houses built.</P>
    <P>We are not seeking to hoard land or invest in a capital asset we would retain, we are seeking to make a temporary intervention in the building land market. This can be done while safeguarding the capital assets held by the State and the pension fund. That would be a useful way to proceed. My basic point is that there are ways of using the capital resources available to this fund such as through productive investment, investment that will show a return and investment that, over the period in question, will ensure that the capital sum is secured. I would support our proceeding in that way.</P>
    <P>I have made clear that I harbour substantial reservations in respect of the Bill. The pension fund is a good idea and we will attempt to operate it within the broad principles and mechanisms set out in the Bill. However, amendments will be required on Committee Stage. My party has reservations about this not merely for now but also in respect of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important social policies administered by any Government relates to the wide-ranging and various pension programmes which are currently operating for social welfare recipients and public servants. The Government understands the importance of putting in place innovative structures to encourage people to take out pension plans for themselves and their families to ensure they have a secure income when they retire. Pension programmes are in place for public servants, social welfare recipients and private sector employees. The Government has always supported the implementation of tax breaks to encourage people in the private and public sectors to take up pension plans during their working lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before discussing the specific provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill in detail, I will make a brief comment about the ongoing reform process in respect of old age pensions. I welcome the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affair's recent statement at the launch of a report on phase one of a fundamental reform of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. The main issues <Col N="1557" /> explored in this review were the implementation of the proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium. These included a commitment to allowing women who take time off work for family reasons to qualify for pensions. The action programme also shifted the current complicated yearly average approach to qualifying for pensions to a more equitable approach based on total contributions over one's lifetime.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was correct when he stated that this is a fundamental review of pension qualification conditions. Together with the proposals set out in the national pensions policy initiative, this review provides a sound framework for examining pension provisions in Ireland into the new millennium. More detailed proposals will be developed in phase two of this review.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, one of the Government's key priorities has been to improve old age pension rates which have risen by 14% in real terms since 1997. However, the Government must also ensure that the qualification conditions for such pensions are more equitable and respond to changing social and economic conditions. I will continue to lobby the Government to ensure that future increases in old age pensions are included in the next budget.</P>
    <P>I will now analyse some of the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill. There was a lively debate in respect of last year's budget when tax changes concerning individualisation were introduced. It is ironic that the Government allocation of £600 million to cover the future costs of social welfare and public service pensions went arguably unnoticed. This is in part a reflection of changing macro-economic conditions in Ireland but, as such, it did not catch the full attention of the general public.</P>
    <P>However, last year the Government took this wise and bold decision partially to pre-fund the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions over the long-term. The Government did this by setting aside 1% of gross national product this year from the annual budget which is currently around £600 million and by allocating part of the Telecom Éireann flotation proceeds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a highly innovative measure and the Minister for Finance must be congratulated on his boldness in introducing it. It is always much easier to spend money today and not to look to the needs of future generations. However, all evidence from scientists and actuaries in Ireland and Europe suggests that we are now living longer than ever. It is estimated that from the year 2025 onward the number of people over 65 in Ireland will rise significantly. There are wide-ranging demographic projections pointing in <Col N="1558" /> this direction. Only recently in <i>The Irish Times </i>I read that scientists are indicating that children born today may easily live to 120 years of age and beyond. The national pensions reserve fund provides for the establishment, financing, investment and management of a reserve fund aimed at meeting part of the escalating Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions from the year 2025.</P>
      <P>This Bill may be broken into six parts which clearly outline the role of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and the administration of the actions of the national pensions reserve fund. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission which will control and manage this pensions fund. The primary function of the commission will be to determine an investment strategy. This will include decisions to be taken in relation to assets allocation and will set appropriate benchmarks with regard to the overall performance of the fund and of particular asset classes in which the fund is also to be invested.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides that the fund cannot be invested in Irish Government securities. This restriction is to ensure that the fund may not be used at some future date artificially to support Government borrowing. Section 6(1) provides for the appointment of investment managers to invest and manage portions of the fund while it also provides for the appointment of custodians to safeguard the assets of the fund. Other functions of the commission provided for under section 6 are the authorisation of payments from the fund; determination of an annual administration budget; commissioning of independent valuations of the assets of the fund and assessment of the projected Exchequer outlays on social welfare pensions and public service pensions; submission of annual reports to the Minister; and maintenance of accounts and submission of annual accounts to the Minister. The commission will perform its functions through a manager who will act as the commission's chief executive.</P>
      <P>Under section 7 the commission will consist of a chairperson and six ordinary members who will be appointed by the Minister. Persons appointed to the commission will be required to have substantial expertise and experience in a number of specified areas. The term of office of ordinary members of the commission, other than the chief executive, will be five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 3 deals with the actual national pensions reserve fund. Section 18 provides for the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund, the purpose of which is to cater for the Exchequer costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 onwards. Section 18(2) requires the Minister to pay into the fund from central funds an annual sum equivalent to 1% of GNP in each year from 2001 onward. Such payments are to be made in equal quarterly instalments based on the budget estimate of GNP for the relevant year in which payments are made. <Col N="1559" /> Section 19 defines the high level investment policy for the fund based on commercial principles. The objective will be to get the best return for the fund consistent with prudent risk management.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Pensions Reserve Bill, 2000. We have an ageing population. In my part of the country I am particularly conscious of this where the average age is higher than in other areas. We are also experiencing a declining birth rate. In the past two days I have listened to considerable debate on national radio about the effects of our ageing population and what this will mean in the future. In the past the average lifespan was assumed to be between 70 and 80 years but this is increasing all the time and it is projected that some of us may live to 120. Some of us will appear to be in a very bad state by then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us may well still be here. It is important to recognise that we are not prepared financially to fund pensions for 20, 30 or 40 years. This Bill puts in place a plan to enable us to continue to pay social welfare and public service pensions in the future.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a fund such as this has serious budgetary implications, but without it we will face serious consequences in the future. In the years ahead we will have fewer people working and we will, therefore, experience lower growth. This will not enable us to make provision for pensions. We will also have increased health care costs. We are already experiencing this development throughout the country. Adequate health care must be provided for our ageing population. We are facing increased long-term care costs and increased pension costs.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not unique in this regard. Many other European countries are in a worse situation than we are. Those countries, however, are taking corrective action although perhaps in different ways. Germany, for example, has put plans in place. The Minister stated that while our current dependency ratio is one person over 65 to every five people working, the ratio in 2016 will be one over 65 to every four people working, and the ratio will continue to fall. Some statistics show that by the year 2046 we will have a 50% dependency ratio. The EU average is 55% so that other countries are experiencing greater difficulties than Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What must we do to prepare for this situation? The national pensions policy initiative prepared a report on this issue, as did a number of groups within the Minister's Department. The policy initiative report, which was presented to the Minister in July 1999, examined the corrective action needed. It reported that provision of the existing level of pension costs 4.7% of GNP in 2000 but maintenance of the same level of pension would <Col N="1560" /> cost 9.2% of GNP in 2036. Even in a relatively short period of time the burden of the cost of pensions will double.</P>
    <P>What can we do about this? We can sit back and do nothing and continue the pay-as-you-go method which has existed in the past. However, if we do this we will face a substantial increase in the level of taxation. Alternatively, we can decide to do something about it. I am delighted the Minister for Finance has taken the initiative because it is not easy to do so. We are enjoying great economic success in this country and are fortunate enough to be able to put 1% of GNP into a reserve pension fund of this type.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are enjoying such wonderful economic success, this is not a great burden on us but we have to recognise that this strategy will exist well into the future, certainly for the next 50 plus years. There will be times when it will put a serious strain on the country, particularly if we do not continue to enjoy the current level of economic growth. Having said that, I agree with the Minister that the long-term gain to be derived as a result of taking this decision is worth any pain we have to endure as a nation and I fully support him.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that 1% is not sufficient to cater for the needs of our ageing population in the future. In excess of 3% or even 4%, would need to be contributed if we are to adequately prepare ourselves for the cost of increased pensions in the years ahead. However, I recognise that this is a step in the right direction and I am sure all Members would fully support the Minister's initiative.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the very clear guidelines set down by the Minister on investment of the moneys in the fund. This is very important because if we are to make the sacrifice of donating 1% of GNP to a fund of this type, it is important that we generate a solid commercial return from the moneys invested. I welcome the indication in the guidelines that decisions will be made on a commercial basis. That will necessitate much of the fund money having to be invested abroad because the Irish market, as everybody is aware, is very small. To get prudent investment advice, it is important that much of the money is invested outside of the country. I also welcome the fact that drawdowns on the fund cannot commence before 2025. It is important that the fund is not raided for any other purpose but is used for the purpose for which it was originally intended. That is safeguarded by the Minister setting down those guidelines.</P>
    <P>If we invest this 1% premium, the projected size of the fund by 2025 will be 42% of GNP. Should we be able to enhance the fund in the future &ndash; I hope we will be because it will be needed &ndash; if one takes a 3% premium, one is talking about 57% of GNP which would place us in a much stronger position. I am also pleased the fund will be owned at all stages by the Minister for Finance and that, in the way he has set up the <Col N="1561" /> fund, the commissioners who will have responsibility for the fund must have proper managerial experience in this area. That is a critical point. There has been much debate about whether suitable people are put in positions to do the job in question. The Minister has safeguarded that by stipulating in the Bill that the commissioners will have managerial expertise in the area to ensure the fund is invested properly.</P>
    <P>I also welcome that the National Treasury Management Agency will act as an executive to the commissioners for a ten year period. The steps currently being taken by the Minister in providing this fund will ease the burden on us as a country in the years ahead. I welcome the provision that the chairperson of the commissioners in charge of the fund will also be responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts. That is a very important step because accountability and transparency, particularly in regard to such a large sum of money, is vital. Any person placed in such an influential position must be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The fund will enable this Government to meet future pension requirements. It will not be used to provide for other social issues. That is provided for in the Bill. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his initiative. It is not often that Ministers look forward to what will happen in 30 and 50 years' time. This is a very brave and welcome step and in the fullness of time people will thank him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille um Chúlchiste Náisiúnta Pinsean, 2000. This legislation provides us with one of those rare opportunities to focus on long-term interests and planning. From that point of view, it is welcome as we rarely get such an opportunity given the day to day, hand to mouth type of legislation that is often debated. While this is of major concern to people looking ahead to their days as pensioners, it is also important to focus on those being born and going to school today and to plan not only for their pensions but for the type of society in which they will live and hopefully enjoy. The pensioners of 2030, 2040 and onwards will live in a very different type of economy. I hope the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill will take into account the long-term investments that would bear this in mind.</P>
      <P>At a lecture in Trinity College recently, Dr. Campbell, a petro-geologist, made a very strong and thought-provoking comment. He said that whereas oil had driven the 20th century, it would not exist to drive the whole of the 21st century. That in itself raises many questions about the type of economy in which this national pensions reserve fund will be paid out. There is no doubt the recent oil shocks will increase in frequency. If nothing else, they are a warning signal that we have only a limited time before major transformations take place to get us off our junkie-like dependency on oil as the driving force in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> This Bill also raises serious questions of social equity, given that people who are currently investing in pension funds are very different in terms of their ability to make such investments. Many people do not have the luxury of thinking that far ahead and will depend entirely on social welfare pensions. The Bill must ensure the pensions are index linked as well as planning for a greater increase in social welfare pensions to ensure a level of social equity which is often aspired to and talked about but seldom seen. This gap between rich and poor mirrors the gap between the rich and poor in the northern and southern hemispheres, which is also widening. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government on securing a place at the United Nations Security Council. I hope the long-term thinking in this Bill will be reflected in a similar type of long-term thinking in our diplomatic efforts to bridge the gap to which I referred and ensure social equity on a global scale as well as here. It is our duty to do this.</P>
    <P>In terms of the operation of the fund, an article in today's<i> The Irish Times</i> states that the manager of the commission that will deal with the fund has already been chosen. That raises questions as to how accountable and to what extent the management of the fund is based on merit. The NTMA is mentioned as the assumed management structure for the fund, but hopefully lessons have been learned from the past. It is important to ensure that appointments to such a body are opened to the type of accountability, competition and meritorious consideration to which all jobs should be. I ask the Minister to reflect on this because the last thing we want is for people to assume this is another closed competition which is not open to people who feel they might have a particular role to play in managing this fund to the best effect.</P>
    <P>I echo Deputy McDowell in stressing the necessity of the ethical investment aspects. No matter how much we talk about social equity, sustainability and ensuring moral integrity in investments, if we simply allow the investment to be dictated by market forces then we will be seen as little more than hypocritical in our claims to be acting in the best public interest and in the interest of the common good. The tobacco and arms industries have been mentioned as the <i>bêtes noires</i> of the investment community, and rightly so. The type of economy we should be planning for and investing in, which will ensure quality of life for people who are now schoolchildren and who will be pensioners, requires that we make strategic and long-term investments to ensure, for example, energy conservation and renewable energy are well provided for and that we are successful in providing the returns necessary for such a fund. It is important to bear in mind that Ireland had an opportunity to invest in renewable energy in the Bellacorick wind farm in County Mayo, but investment could not be found in this country &ndash; it was not considered a safe investment. Instead investment had to be sought and obtained from Denmark. This indicates the short-<Col N="1563" /> term, blinkered thinking which is going to backfire on us badly unless our strategic thinking is long-term, something which applies to investments as well as this pension fund.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that ecologically sound developments require investment and I hope the Minister will signal that the long-term thinking behind this Bill, which I welcome, will be followed through in terms of a long-term investment climate which will last well into the 21st century and beyond, rather than following the usual investment portfolio which looks to the end of the day's business in the Stock Exchange. For example, the forestry industry is bedevilled by such short-term, quick rotation venture capital investment. While this might give a short-term return, in the long-term it is self defeating as it creates a glut, a lower price and a worse return than a long-term, broad leaf, hardwood, indigenous investment. This is nothing new. The lessons in this regard have been learned in other countries, particularly on the Continent where investment thinking is much more long-term than has been the case to date in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister were to enlighten me on the type of portfolio investments he has in mind in terms of the Bill and if they will be looking to the future after 2025, bearing in mind what I said at the outset, namely, that oil drives the 20th century and cannot drive the 21st century, and how this will affect the Minister's thinking in terms of long-term pension fund provisions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister said this is a simple, clear-cut Bill, and to a certain extent it is. However, I agree with the Deputies who say it involves critical issues which should be far more widely debated than heretofore in the Dáil, society, the workforce and by all the people who will be affected by it in various ways. There is no doubt that when a Bill as initiated includes a provision of almost £5 billion for the fund and a further 1% of GNP per annum, we are talking about substantial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister the Bill is based on the projections made regarding demographics and the percentages of the population which will be at various ages. There are projections in regard 2016 and up to 2056. It is wise and proper to plan in advance, but it is very difficult at this stage to be very accurate on the precise age structure of the population in 2056 and what economic structures here and in Europe will be by that time. Perhaps we will have democratic socialism where all the resources of society will be invested in the public good with comprehensive care for pensioners and those who are ill, poor and homeless, a situation we do not have at present. Therefore, the issue of a balance between the current need for the deployment of resources for those dependent on State payments and provisions for the future arises. The Minister should have dwelt longer on these issues and justified the commit<Col N="1564" /> ment he is making to the national pensions reserve fund and related this to the current needs and demands on the State for an improvement in living standards and the quality of life of people who are in many cases confined entirely to dependency on State payments.</P>
    <P>More serious questions are raised by the national pensions reserve fund commission, how it will function and how the funds in the reserve will be deployed and invested. The Bill provides for an independent commission. However, how independent will it and should it be? The Bill provides for what the Minister calls accountability to the Minister for Finance and the Dáil. However, as outlined by the Minister, that accountability does not amount to very much. Provision for detailed annual reports is necessary as is the appearance of the commission chairperson, the chief executive and the manager before the Committee of Public Accounts. However, regarding the criteria which will be set down for the investment of these funds, I wonder how much influence Dáil Éireann will have or to what degree the views of the majority of people in the State will be represented.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that a strictly commercial investment mandate for the fund will be put in place. Where precisely will this lead? Where will the investment end up? Will it end up here or abroad? It is accepted that a large proportion of the fund would, under our current structures, be invested abroad. Does the Minister intend to lay strict criteria in regard to the manner of investment which would be permissible or encouraged and that which would be prohibited by the regulations before the Dáil? </P>
    <P>Reference was made to the armaments industry. That is a critical issue and the Minister should, in his reply, state categorically that not one penny of any pension reserve fund will be invested in the armaments industry either in this country or abroad. Were the Minister to make such a statement, it would require quite a degree of research and supervision to ensure that would not happen. The tentacles of the armaments industry are reaching ever further into different countries and areas. In many countries which pride themselves on being supposed democracies, the military industrial complex carries a huge weight and its tentacles extend into many societal activities. It is crucial that it would be stipulated that not one penny will be involved in any company which derives its income or profits from the creation of weapons of destruction. Can we seriously accept any assurances in this regard from this Government when the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issues hundreds of licences &ndash; up to 400 on an annual basis &ndash; to companies which export material which is related to the armaments industry? It would appear, judging by the line the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment adopted some days ago, that this Government is intent on encouraging Irish owned and Irish based companies to further engage in production <Col N="1565" /> for the international armaments industry through the supply of parts&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>With respect, I am very much within the parameters of the Bill because, in ten years' time, the Minister will have in the region of £15 billion to invest. My point, which is well in order on a Second Stage speech, is that this Bill must state the criteria for such investment.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to state why the fund should not be used to invest in the provision of badly needed infrastructure and services for which people are crying out. We currently have a massive housing crisis where young people cannot afford the speculative prices being charged. Why should the Minister and the Government not use pension funds to establish a national house building agency with a brief to build homes for people who cannot afford the obscene prices being charged in the marketplace? Many middle income workers who cannot afford these prices would be in a position to buy affordable homes which would provide income to the pension fund in the future while at the same time catering for a very important need in society. I would like to see this proposal and others being teased out.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that current State pensions are very inadequate and that increased resources must be deployed in this area? How does he propose to strike a balance between investment in the national reserve fund and current needs? Public service pensioners were deeply aggrieved by the fact that their link to increases in salaries in the public services was discontinued in 1996 or 1997. Does the Minister believe that, in regard to current and future commitments, serious inequities must be addressed and funds must be committed in this area?</P>
      <P>The Minister put in perspective the 1% gross national product from the Exchequer which will go into the fund each year until at least 2055. By comparison, he stated that the amount which would go towards servicing the national debt was approximately 3% of gross national product. If my memory serves me correctly, taxpayers paid in the region of £3 billion to £4 billion to service the national debt last year. That is a very sobering figure which should be examined in the context of what is being invested for our people. It is outrageous that three or four times of what is being committed for the pensioners and welfare recipients of the future will go towards fattening the already bloated profits of the international and domestic banks. That, in my view, is immoral and speaks volumes about the nature of a system about which nobody in this Government raises questions.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am suggesting we should carry out an audit on how much profit we have contributed to international bankers. In the case of NET there should be an inquiry into why £188 million in interest was paid on the principal. Why did the State not repay the £164 million debt? It would have had £188 million extra which could have been used to increase pensions for those dependent on them and on social welfare. The case is unanswerable. In the event of democratic socialism and the philosophy I hold having majority support at some stage, and it will happen, we would not be bound by the usurious agreements entered into between previous Governments and international bankers. The people's need to live in reasonable comfort and dignity comes before everything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister should elaborate in some detail on whether he agrees that the investment of funds from the national pension reserve fund should be subject to detailed and clearly outlined ethical guidelines. I mentioned the armaments industry. That would be one area but environmental concerns on an international basis would be another. Many multinationals which may be good sources of profit play a despicable role in degrading the environment in the Third World and elsewhere. Some of them are involved in genetic engineering and play a perfidious role and will so do increasingly in the future if they are let away with it.</P>
      <P>The public may not agree with every point I make but I believe that the people whose taxes we are talking about and whose pensions are being provided for will want to be very clear that any investment from this country will be for the enhancement of people whether within or outside our boundaries and will not play any role in the destruction of the world's environment or peoples through the armaments industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is prudent that the State should invest money in pensions for the long term. Before the turn around in the economy it would have been difficult to control pension funds. This Bill is evidence that <Col N="1567" /> we have now become a strong economy and can afford to place 1% of our gross national product in the pension fund. I understand 1% this year will be to the tune of £630 million. The fund is intended to take account of the inevitability of an ageing population. I understand that 1996 data were used in correlating this information and it is widely off the mark as regards the present position. My greatest fear is how effective it will be in 2025. I would like the Minister to address that issue.</P>
      <P>While paying old age and public service pensions out of current tax revenue is not an easy or popular option, by making early provision or investing well the current working generation can preserve the old age pension from the political pressures of rising tax rates that could otherwise lead to an erosion of pension funds. An article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> raises a number of points regarding the legislation that are worth mentioning. The main element of the Bill is the investment mandate and the Government's structure of the pension fund. It states:</P>
      <P>The manager of the fund needs to be given a clear mandate. Nobody wants the fund to hold only speculative dot.com; nor would the pensioners have been well served by a manager who plumped for recent initial public offerings by green chips such as Eircom or First Active. [It should be taken into consideration] that no Irish Government securities are to be held and investments are to be made on strictly commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to having the law preclude the fund from holding Irish assets.</P>
      <P>.it is not hard to foresee that, without some restrictions on investing at home, there would be continuous political and other pressure from promoters for the fund to finance worthy-sounding but unviable projects.</P>
      <P>[It is important to] insulate the fund from these kinds of pressure right away. Besides, most of the investments should be in foreign assets if risk is to be sufficiently diversified; during an Irish economic downturn we would be doubly hit.</P>
      <P>That must be taken into consideration because if we had Irish investment and there was a downturn in the economy this Bill would have huge implications for funding. I hope the Minister will consider that.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with everything Deputy Higgins said. We differ greatly as regards our economic strategy. However, I agree that when considering investment policy you must also consider ethical practice. He is correct in stating that we should not invest in the armaments industry or environmentally unfriendly activities such as felling rain forests. There should be guidelines laid down for the fund manager to ensure that does not happen. The article further states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> [It would be better] to simply define the broad classes of allowable assets and require the manager to invest sufficiently widely in these classes to ensure that the fund's return equals that on the average of these allowable assets .. the fund should be established from the outset as a passive &ldquo;index fund&rdquo;, tracking the whole investment market rather than trying to pick winners.</P>
    <P>Index funds are cheap to operate and are as safe as the market allows.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>The seven person commission is to determine the investment strategy and to control the fund.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the article, it shows that the chief executive of the fund is a member of the commission and of the board. A fair point has been raised that the individual concerned should not be on the commission. It should be an independent, advisory body advising him or her on the type of investments that should be made. Consideration should be given in the legislation to establishing a board that is more effectively independent.</P>
    <P>The public service pension fund places a massive financial burden on the Exchequer. We are in a very strong economic position. When I did my leaving certificate way back in 1978 the only jobs available were in the Civil Service. If one could get their leaving certificate and walk and talk, one had a decent chance of getting into it. The alternative was college or emigration. Today there is a labour shortage. The massive numbers of jobs being created in the private sector cannot be filled from among the workforce. There is a need to bring in labour from abroad which in itself is not a bad thing.</P>
    <P>An embargo on recruitment to the Civil Service was introduced in the 1980s when jobs were not being created. Today too many jobs are being created and there is still an open door policy so far as the civil and public service is concerned. The Government should consider introducing such an embargo. While the civil and public service does necessary work, much of it is unproductive in the sense that it is administrative in nature. As a friend of mine says, we have laws but no order. Such a radical approach is needed and would make a massive difference in easing the labour shortage. If someone is offered a job in the private sector and a permanent pensionable position in the civil and public service, the easy option is to opt for the civil and public service. I am a lone voice on this issue. I will probably be committed to an institution shortly&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I will address some of the general points raised. We can return to individual issues on Committee Stage. Much as I disagree with some of the comments made, I welcome the extension of the debate regarding the pensions reserve fund.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill. Deputy Joe Higgins started off by saying that the Minister said that this was a simple Bill. I do not recall saying that; it is anything but simple. While the concept may be simple &ndash; providing moneys to meet future liabilities &ndash; I readily accept that there are a number of very important issues to which I have devoted much time. Some of them have been raised by Deputies opposite and in today's article, which I welcome, much as I disagree with certain aspects. While the Bill will not have any particular political effect on my fortunes and those of the Government come the next general election, it will have an effect in years to come &ndash; for the better. I have had an interest in this area for a long time and I have taken the opportunity to do something about it, not alone in this Bill under which moneys will be provided to meet future liabilities but, as Deputy McDowell and others are aware, I have made significant changes in the area of private pensions, some of which he has welcomed. It is an area to which I have given much thought as there was a need for change.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins made the point that the pensions reserve fund has not been the subject of great debate. I would have thought that it would have generated greater debate, but that is not my fault or that of other Deputies. I indicated as far back as July 1999 when I published the report what I would do; I outlined my thinking on the subject at a press conference. When I published the Bill I thought it would be the subject of greater debate. Apart from specialist magazines, today's article in one of the national newspapers is the first to appear on the subject. It reminds me of the debate which took place at the Joint Committee on Finance and General Affairs during the term of office of the previous Administration under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell on the introduction of the euro. Even though we spent days and weeks discussing the issue with experts from home and abroad and distilled everyone's views from the far left to the far right, it merited about ten lines over a period of one and a half years. In spite of this it was a most interesting debate during which most of those who participated learned much. It failed, however, to generate much debate among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will elaborate a little on the projections underpinning the Bill. The Irish Pensions Trust, now part of Mercers Limited, carried out an actuarial review of social welfare pensions in September 1997. Mercers has recently updated this review to take account of demographic and econ<Col N="1570" /> omic changes as well as changes in pension rates and contribution levels in the meantime. The figures I have used are based on this updated review. Rather than go through all the assumptions behind the projections at length, I will forward the updated review to Deputies Noonan and McDowell.</P>
    <P>Public service pension projections are based on a recent update by my Department of the Irish Pensions Trust review of public service pensions carried out in 1997 on behalf of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, the McAleese commission established by the previous Government, which presented its interim report to me in autumn 1997. Its final report is due next week. Unlike other reports, the interim report was very easy to read and understand, something for which I commend Professor McAleese.</P>
    <P>Deputies should note that social welfare pensions will account for the bulk of the rise in pension costs. Of the projected pension costs in 2056 of 12.4% of GNP, 10% arises from social welfare pension provisions with 2.4% arising from public service pension costs. I take Deputy Noonan's point that increased immigration and labour force participation could improve our capacity to meet the future pensions burden. The projections can only be based, however, on the best information available at the time. Given the size of the projected pensions bill facing us and the fact that prefunding will only meet part of the burden, even a substantial increase in labour force participation and immigration is likely to do very little to undermine the case for prefunding.</P>
    <P>The question of investment in Ireland was raised. The Bill does not prevent the fund investing in infrastructural projects on a public-private partnership basis. What the commissioners must do, however, before investing in any asset in Ireland or abroad is have regard to the commercial investment mandate of the fund. This mandate will prevent pressure being placed on the commissioners to make commercially dubious investments to which Deputy Reynolds referred or to provide capital for companies or projects which would otherwise have difficulty in attracting private sector investment.</P>
    <P>I have given this area much thought and come down in favour of giving the commissioners a strictly commercial investment mandate. To do otherwise would be to take away their discretion. On the other hand, I recognise that there has to be accountability. I have dealt with that as follows: First, the commission must produce an annual report. Second, the chairman and chief executive of the commission, who in the first instance will be the chief executive of the NTMA, must appear before an Oireachtas committee. Having considered this matter at length, I believe this procedure will address many of the issues raised in this debate. For example, if the annual report produced by the commission shows an investment in a company with a dubious record in some of the areas referred to by Deputy Joe Higgins, the public pressure would be such as to <Col N="1571" /> ensure that the fund would not make similar investments in the following year.</P>
    <P>The other alternative would be to lay down strict guidelines and rules in this area, but the best approach is to deal with it in the way I have outlined. The annual report will clearly indicate the investments in companies and other investments made by the fund. There will be a report to the Oireachtas, so there will be public knowledge about it. There will be scrutiny by the Oireachtas in the form of the chairman and chief executive appearing before an Oireachtas committee. That procedure will eliminate any difficulties that may arise. To provide otherwise would make the area a minefield.</P>
    <P>In the article referred to, which I read this morning, it was suggested that there should be a total prohibition on the fund investing in Irish companies. However, many Deputies advocated that the fund should invest in Irish infrastructural projects and other ventures. I have decided to prohibit the fund from investing in Irish bonds because if pressure arises in the future the fund may end up propping up the Government by it buying its own paper. Suppose the fund had been established in the 1970s, there may have been a strong temptation in the desperate times of the middle 1980s to have the fund invest in the Government's own paper. I decided, therefore, to insert that prohibition, even though there is no need for it at present.</P>

      <P>I did not agree with the view that the fund should be prohibited from investing in Irish companies. What is meant by an Irish company? Some of the ones talked about have investments abroad. I can think of a large commercial company, not a financial institution, most of whose investments are worldwide. If one assumes a conservative return on fund investment of 1% over the return on Government bonds, the fund is projected to reach 42% of GNP by 2025, the year drawdowns will commence. In view of the magnitude of the fund relative to the limited output of the Irish economy and the need for a well diversified portfolio of investments, it is clear that most of the fund will have to be invested abroad. However, this does not prevent investment in Ireland, although I stress that any decision in this regard is a matter for the commissioners. I am not prohibiting it; I suggest that to get a balance in the fund like any pension fund, most of the investment will be outside Ireland, but I do not prohibit the fund from investing in Ireland. It is for the commissioners to decide and the only limitation is a strictly commercial mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to returns on the fund. The historical experience is that returns on equity investment are greater than the cost of <Col N="1572" /> borrowing. The article referred to a passive investment as opposed to, say, active investment in the market. In my lead-up to introducing the Bill and before I produced the report of July 1999, the evidence then appeared to indicate that funds that follow a passive route do better in the long-term than active management. This surprised me. It does not refer to every fund, but studies have been done on this which indicate that passive fund managers who followed the index got a better return over a period of time than active fund managers. There may be a lesson there for those of us who have a few pounds to invest now and again. I took that into account. The commissioners and the fund manager may take that route, but it is for them to decide. While I cannot attest that this was a worldwide study, it was done by a person in the NTMA who has a good knowledge of this area. He was also surprised at the outcome. I make this point because it was mentioned in the article referred to that it could be the best way to proceed on the basis that it removes the risk.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that public pressure following the publication of the report by the commission will lead the fund managers to act in a certain way. However, the Government of the day should not exert any influence on the fund. Deputy Noonan may fundamentally disagree with me on this, but while it is the right of the Oireachtas to change the law, people will regard the fund as holding their own money. In my professional capacity, my experience has been that the most conservative trustees of funds are people from a trade union background. I have been very impressed by some such people. They were far more conservative than other trustees and demanded that there be no speculative investments on behalf of their employees' pension fund because they regarded it as their workers' money they had put aside. That is the approach I have adopted to this area. It is the people's money which has been put aside.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the Minister for Finance to exert an influence. I could have included various caveats to give the Government of the day the capacity to exert influence over various aspects, but the legislation has been deliberately drafted to ensure that this will not be possible. I have even gone so far as to ensure that commissioners can only be appointed from certain categories of persons. This has not been done before. I hope when appointing commissioners it will be seen that they are above and beyond any reproach and that they will act completely independently.</P>

      <P>&mdash;or whether his organisation has a pension fund or whatever. Most employee groups have pension funds and they regard that money as theirs, not to be tampered with. That is the approach I am taking here. I <Col N="1573" /> am removing it from the Government of the day. While the Oireachtas can make a decision to change it, when it is up and running it will be a brave Minister for Finance who says he intends to dip into the fund to finance certain measures.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and others made the point that the 1% contribution provision is fine while the economy is going well and there are budget surpluses. However, difficulties may arise when the situation is reversed. Inevitably, the economy will not always be in its present healthy position. The Deputy and others have made the point that there should be some flexibility regarding the 1% provision.</P>
      <P>That approach signifies the difference between us on this issue. We should provide for a 'no liability' clause, in the same way as is provided for in respect of ordinary pension costs, education and repaying the national debt each year. This is a debt and the 1% provision should apply. There should be no equivocation on that. I could have provided that it should vary over a period, but that would give a discretionary loophole to the Minister for Finance. Some of the senior civil servants in the Department of Finance who would like to tie up the hands of the Minister into the future might love it. I am fundamentally against that. The Deputies must accept my bona fides in this. I have done everything in my power to ensure the Bill does not have any loopholes for successive Ministers. I may have missed something which might be a loophole, but my intention is not to miss any. There may be principled disagreement among us on this issue.</P>

      <P>Yes. I have been here for more than 23 years and I have seen the pressure on Ministers. While I may not agree with everything the Deputy's party leader has said about economic policy over the years, I agree with much of what he said. I remember when he was Opposition spokesman or Minister for Finance some years ago he signalled that we should introduce a law against fiscal irresponsibility. I do not think he made any contribution to the Bill. I have seen the pressure on Governments and I have seen what Ministers for Finance have had to do. I am trying to ensure the Bill will not be a cookie jar into which someone can dip his hand. I have given a great deal of thought to that over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the 1% contribution, the Budget Strategy for Ageing Group estimated that approximately 3.5% of gross national product would have to be set aside annually to equalise <Col N="1574" /> the Exchequer burden of health and pension costs over the next 50 years. However, given the magnitude of the prospective costs involved and the many other competing demands on the State's finances, it concluded that a more feasible sum to set aside would be 1% of GNP which it estimated would meet approximately 30% of these costs. In making this recommendation, the group acknowledged it was making no provision for the post 2056 situation.</P>
    <P>In establishing a single reserve fund which is not designed to meet a defined liability but to part fund social welfare and public service pension costs to a year potentially beyond 2055, I decided to stay with the recommendation of a 1% GNP contribution. This is a level which will make a significant contribution to future pension costs and is a sustainable commitment. Once built into the multi-annual budgetary structure it should not cause undue difficulty. I reiterate that the contribution is slightly less than our annual contribution to the EU budget and less than one third of the interest payment on the national debt in 1999.</P>
    <P>If our economic circumstances make contributions over and above the 1% of gross national product feasible, the Bill allows additional contributions to the fund by resolution of Dáil Éireann. In effect, the 1% of GNP is a minimum annual contribution to the fund and it is open to Governments to make an increased contribution in any year. I would be opposed to any measure which would vary the annual statutory contribution while requiring that the 1% of GNP be achieved on average over a number of years. I fear this would provide a loophole which would be exploited in times of difficulty.</P>
    <P>I will point out why I decided not to add the assets of the Social Insurance Fund to the fund. The Social Insurance Fund holds the proceeds of employer and employee social insurance contributions and is used to pay all social insurance benefits. In previous years the fund's income was not sufficient to cover the costs of these benefits and had to be subvented by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Largely due to the remarkable increase in employment, income has grown steadily in recent years to the point where there is currently a surplus in the Social Insurance Fund. This surplus is projected to reach £630 million by the end of this year and should increase further over the medium term. Under the terms of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, the Minister for Finance is required to invest this surplus for the benefit of the fund. Last night during the debate on the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, I set out some of the issues around the investment of the fund and how they are being resolved with the assistance of the NTMA.</P>
    <P>Using some or all of the Social Insurance Fund surplus to augment the National Pensions Reserve Fund is an obvious possibility. However, I decided not to proceed in this way for two reasons. My officials spent a great deal of time in negotiations and discussions with the Department <Col N="1575" /> of Social, Community and Family Affairs trying to find an acceptable way to do this. It was my original intention to take this route. However, after spending many thousands of man hours on this issue, I decided for the reasons I will outline not to use part of the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The liabilities of the Social Insurance Fund are more short-term in nature than those of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. Hence, it is likely that it will become necessary to draw on the Social Insurance Fund reserves long before 2025 when drawdowns commence from the National Pensions Reserve Fund. It will be necessary for the Social Insurance Fund to meet all the various social insurance contingencies, such as disability and unemployment benefit as well as contributory pensions. It would be impractical to try to apportion the surplus between those various demands. We were not able to find a solution to it. Deputy Noonan can have the documentation if he so wishes. I decided it was not worth any more hassle or disagreement.</P>
    <P>The question of ethical investment was raised by a number of Deputies. The question of socially responsible investment is only at an early stage of development internationally. There will always be intense public debate about what is ethically acceptable either at a personal or foreign policy level or about what is environmentally acceptable. There will rarely be consensus about such issues. The assets of the fund are likely to be invested to a significant extent in shares of multinational groups. It can be difficult to determine what holdings subsidiarities within such groups may have. Even if one adopts a socially responsible investment policy, it is not easy to implement it. There is a danger that if ethical considerations are part of the invested mandate, those responsible for managing the fund will be dragged into intense public controversy, thereby paralysing their capacity to invest.</P>
    <P>When I was examining the issues, I looked at a number of approaches to implementing a socially responsible investment policy. An inordinate amount of time was spent dealing with this area. I outlined earlier why I came to the conclusion that the best way to deal with it was to proceed with the commercially invested mandate and to have accountability. There are a number of options. One could copy the UK precedent. Although it does not have a pensions reserve fund, its annual report on pension funds must from July this year contain a statement of the approach to the question of socially responsible investment if adopted by a fund. There will be no requirement on funds to invest in this manner, only a requirement to state their policy.</P>
    <P>A fund can use its voting rights to put pressure on companies to pursue socially responsible policies. It appears this approach can be accommodated within a commercial mandate, although its effectiveness is debatable, particularly as the shareholding of the fund in any one company would be relatively small. Some funds put aside a <Col N="1576" /> small portion of their assets, typically 0.5%, into a separate fund which is then invested according to socially responsible criteria. The drawback with this approach is that it is largely tokenism because more than 99% of the fund is invested in the normal manner.</P>
    <P>Screening is an approach which has been used by some funds, for example, charities. It involves hiring analysts who will examine all companies on the index, such as the Standard and Poor 500 index. That is a complicated way of doing things, although it is an option. One could also adopt a mix of any of those approaches.</P>
    <P>The approach I adopted was to give the commissioners the commercial mandate and to publish a report at the end of the year. There will also be accountability to a committee of the Dáil. If an investment is not ethically or socially responsible and public pressure is brought to bear, I am sure the commissioners will take that on board.</P>

      <P>I will not tie the hands of the investment managers of this fund by setting out a range of criteria because I know what would happen. The lowest common denominator would apply and they would be paralysed into indecision. People who invest their own money in investment pension funds should realise they will not have a plus on their returns every year. It will be a minus in some years and quarters. Good surveys are published every quarter on how the funds in Ireland have done. If a person invests in the second quarter, there could be a minus because the markets came off the boil, which often happens. I am worried that with a big investment fund there will not always be a plus every year and that the pressure could be so great the commissioners might take a conservative approach. I will not put any restrictions on them. That may happen so I would not like to constrict them any more than is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was asked if making the NTMA the manager would conflict with the independence of the commission. I provided in the Bill for the appointment of the National Treasury Management Agency to act as agent of the commission in managing the fund for an initial period of ten years. After this period, there will be the option, at five yearly intervals, for the commissioners to extend this arrangement further or to appoint an alternative manager. In deciding to give this role to the NTMA, I was strongly influenced by the fact that almost £5 billion will be entrusted to the commissioners once the fund is established. They will, therefore, need to have access to a fully functioning executive with assistance and expertise to manage such a large sum from day one. The NTMA has been managing the liability side of a safe balance sheet for more than a decade now. While the agency may require some additional skills, I consider it far more sens<Col N="1577" /> ible to have the NTMA manage the funds than to expect the commissioners to start from scratch and to establish a second specialised agency to manage such a large amount of money.</P>
    <P>There is no conflict between the agency's debt management role and its role as manager of the pension fund. As manager of the national debt, the chief executive of the NTMA is responsible to the Minister for Finance but as manager of the national pension reserve fund, he is responsible to the commission and any possible conflict between those roles would be removed by the prohibition on the fund investing in Irish Government securities.</P>
    <P>One Deputy made the point that we are paying off the national debt. People may not realise that this will be the third year in a row we will be paying off the national debt. When the State has an overall budgetary surplus, as I have had in 1998, 1999 and will this year, that money will automatically go towards bringing down the national debt. We did not see it so much at the end of 1999 because during 1999, the NTMA on my behalf restructured much of the national debt to make it more tradable and that had the cosmetic effect of increasing the nominal increase of the national debt but the economic costs were the same. This year we will see the national debt falling in absolute terms because regardless of whether one takes the budget surplus as predicted on budget day or the latest predictions, they will automatically bring down the national debt depending on what the exchange rate is on 31 December <i>vis-à-vis</i> certain elements of the national debt &ndash; it is not all held in euros although the vast bulk of it is. I am sure we will revisit many of these points on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I finished speaking on the Aviation Bill the other evening I had sought assurances from the Minister regarding the equity that would be used in terms of various airport charges. For instance, I was particularly concerned about the way in which the Department of Health and Children administers funds to disabled people, where overheads end up costing about 60% of the charge and the cross-subsidisation that has been going on in Aer Rianta. The Minister, in her regulations to the commissioner, will have to clear up this matter in order to overcome the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I support the suggestion that has come from the employees of Shannon Airport who are looking for a general manager to represent the aviation commission in each of the airports who would report directly to the commissioner. This is most important because of the way in which the growth of Dublin Airport has overshadowed the other two airports &ndash; Cork and Shannon. For that reason, a certain amount of independence is required by the two airports to deal with the regulator/commissioner who will be responsible for these charges. Will the Minister consider this matter before going further with the Bill?</P>
      <P>As far as the independence of airports is concerned, there are also problems with regard to their development. For instance, international companies have expressed an interest from time to time in setting up at Shannon Airport but decided against doing so because there is no cross runway allowing them to land 24 hours a day in all kinds of weather. Most aircraft today can land provided they are provided with the necessary infrastructure. I know the lighting system has been improved in Shannon Airport but it needs further upgrading. A cross runway is needed to give the airport international status for the future. The problem with this Bill is that if some kind of independence is not established by regulation, Dublin Airport will continue to suffer from growing pains, which is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There used to be a highly thought of service at <Col N="1579" /> Shannon Airport, namely, the in-flight catering. The equipment at Shannon Airport has aged and new investment is needed. There appears to be a hesitancy in Aer Rianta to reinvest in the airport but it must see that there is a market for a modern in-flight catering service, competitively supplied by Shannon Airport, which would attract more people. The airport has already shown its adaptability in that it has dealt with requests from different sects who require different kinds of foods. It was the first on the market with frozen food. It developed a full system for in-flight catering with hot food in particular and with modern technology it can go even further. I ask the Minister to encourage Aer Rianta to invest more fully in a new in-flight catering division in Shannon Airport. That would be an additional attraction for people to utilise Shannon Airport on an international stage and increase the amount of traffic at the terminal. I regret that these charges will be put in place without Shannon having the necessary infrastructural development required of an international airport.</P>
    <P>The easy access to and departure from Shannon Airport and its user friendly status can be promoted to good effect in the future. I urge the Minister to examine my proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Like my colleagues, I empathise with the Minister's statement that as we are an island nation we are greatly dependent on having proper access <i>via</i> our airports to the rest of the world, particularly in the growing and successful economy we currently enjoy. This Bill has been introduced as a result. We are also fortunate that our aviation sector has an excellent reputation. The Irish Aviation Authority has enjoyed a good reputation as a provider of a quality, safe and efficient service. We want this Bill to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>
      <P>Considerable debate on the responsibilities that come under this Bill, such as air traffic control charges, ground handling services etc., has taken place on our national airwaves over many months. That is nothing new because this situation has been flagged for some time. We were aware that with the abolition of duty free sales the manner in which charges are imposed in our airports would have to be seriously examined. I welcome that the Minister has grasped this important issue and has introduced this Bill with the primary purpose of establishing a new regulatory body that will be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That commission will have five areas of responsibility, the approval of airport and air traffic control charges, the approval of ground handling service providers at airports, something about which we have all heard a good deal of debate in recent weeks, the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take off and landing slots at airports and <Col N="1580" /> the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators.</P>
    <P>In fulfilling these new responsibilities the commission will exercise its functions under existing legislation but also in line with EU regulations. When the Minister examined this issue she was concerned about the potential for conflict that existed between the shareholder role and the regulator role, which she addresses specifically in the Bill by setting up an independent economic regulation of Irish airports under the new commission. I welcome that step.</P>
    <P>Part III contains the major sections of the Bill. Section 31 outlines the scope of this regulation. There was confusion about this provision when it was discussed in the past day or two. It will apply to only airports with more than one million passengers annually. Deputies referred to airports throughout the length and breadth of the country, but many of them would not deal with that number of passengers annually.</P>
    <P>Section 32 outlines the nature and scope of the regulator's role. The framework in which a determination is made in terms of the procedures, the duration and the application of the determination are laid out in this section, particularly obligations to consultation, which is a critical point. I compliment the Minister on highlighting it in that section. It is important that all those affected by the five functions of the new commission are engaged in the consultation process. That provision is catered for in this section.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that after a two year period the commission, at its own instigation or at the request of an interested party, can carry out a review of the original decision on its charges. I welcome that as do those involved in the airlines who will be interested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 33 outlines the regulatory objectives that will be addressed by the commission prior to making a determination on airport charges. The aim of that provision is to create a regulatory regime whereby the competing needs of all players are taken into account. That is a fair and critical section.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides for an enforcement procedure whereby the commission may apply to the High Court or for a High Court order to ensure compliance with its decisions and its requests.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to sections 44 and 47 which are critical. Section 44 deals with company law requirements that any offence committed by a body corporate with the knowledge and consent of a director or officer of that body shall be regarded as having committed an offence. Section 47 deals with the freedom of information legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill. While we appreciate that Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport are very busy today, if we are to provide a proper and efficient service, essential infrastructure must be in place in our airports to ensure we can provide the level of service, similar to that which we enjoyed in the past, to meet the increasing demands they will face in the years <Col N="1581" /> ahead. This Bill is comprehensive and fair to all parties concerned to enable that to be the case. The Minister will be complimented in time for her foresight in introducing this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a voluminous document. It does not provide much satisfaction to people who are not fortunate enough to have access to an air service. The Bill seems to be geared towards the creation of extra facilities in the three major national airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon. I am amazed Knock Airport in the west does not make the grade of being considered a major national airport along with the three to which I referred, given that it caters for a large part of the country.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the aviation section has played an important part in our economy, primarily by supporting growth and commerce in many vital areas of industry. Since the development of the channel tunnel which joins Great Britain to mainland Europe, we are the only island nation in Europe not joined to mainland Europe. It is of paramount importance that aviation is promoted to the fullest in Ireland. Industrial and commercial interests of all kinds should be given an opportunity to compete with their EU neighbours. It is time the playing field was levelled for our industrialists and entrepreneurs in line with their EU counterparts. Industrial and commercial interests would benefit from development and expansion of the aviation industry in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take questions, the House will have heard that Donald Dewar, the First Minister of Scotland, has died. I extend the sympathy of the Government and that of my party as well as, I am sure, that of everyone else in the House to his family, relatives and friends in the British Cabinet and to all the people of Scotland. He was the first elected Minister of the Scottish Assembly who had been here on many occasions and was due to be here leading the Scottish delegation at the British-Irish Council meeting next Wednesday morning. This is a great tragedy for all his colleagues in the Labour Party and for the people he represented. He represented all Scotland in his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had been ill and made a miraculous recovery during the summer following very extensive surgery. He was in the House with me and was here for a lecture last Friday week, which is 12 days ago. He was a fine person, very committed to public life and especially committed to Scotland. He wanted to see everything move ahead there. He had some difficulties in the beginning in getting the Assembly moving but felt very happy when I spoke to him 12 days ago that things were <Col N="1582" /> now going much better and he was glad to be going back to work. Unfortunately, following the accident yesterday which resulted in serious head injuries, he died a short time ago. I extend my sympathy on his death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone coming into the Chamber in the past few minutes will have been shocked to have heard that Donald Dewar has died. We heard this morning that he had suffered a fall in his official residence but few believed it would lead to the end of his life. He suffered some ill health in recent times which was probably not unrelated to the huge personal effort he made to ensure the arrangements for the governing of Scotland by its people independently of others would work as intended. Donald Dewar will be remembered for centuries to come as the first person to lead Scotland independently within a large area of freedom since the Act of Union of 1701. He achieved that independence for Scotland within the United Kingdom without the loss of a single life and without shedding a single drop of blood. There are lessons for all to learn from the career of Donald Dewar and other patriotic Scots who have been able to ensure that Scotland was able to have full political expression of its nationhood.</P>
      <P>It is also important to reflect that Scotland has many similarities to Ulster. Scotland, 50, 60 or 70 years ago, was as divided on sectarian lines as Ulster is today. The traditional divide between the highlands and the lowlands goes back long before the Battle of Culloden and other events in Scottish history. This meant that the idea of a united Scottish nationhood was almost impossible to conceive of because of the depth of the divide on religious and political grounds and also in terms of what appeared to be almost unbridgeable allegiances to dynasties. However, the current generation of Scottish politicians have been able to forge a new and non-sectarian Scotland which has healed these divisions which still divide our island so much but no longer divide Scotland. It would not have been possible for Scotland to have achieved autonomy as a whole unit were it not for the fact that those sectarian divisions had been healed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great deal to learn from Scotland because we have not succeeded in Ireland in doing what Donald Dewar and others have in creating a consensus in Scotland and a form of autonomous Government which bridges those divides that go right back to the wars of Montrose, the massacre of Glencoe and the bloody fields of Culloden. Those divisions which were so deep in Scotland so recently and which are so graphically epitomised by the relics seen in the sectarian slogans shouted at Rangers-Celtic football matches have been swept aside as far as their political consequences are concerned by people like Donald Dewar. They have not been swept aside on this island. We have a great deal to learn from Scotland and from Donald Dewar. We have <Col N="1583" /> a great man to mourn in the person of Donald Dewar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I rise on behalf of the Labour Party to express my deepest regret and sympathy on the sad, tragic and sudden death of Donald Dewar, a member of the Party of European Socialists and the British Labour Party. He was, first and foremost, a Scottish man devoted to his Scotland and to his Labour Party in Scotland who saw exactly the synthesis in both of those in the manner Deputy Bruton has just described.</P>
      <P>He will go down in history as the father of modern Scotland. He fought long and hard in the early stages immediately after the election victory of the British Labour Party in 1997, had a spectacular feat in the referenda which were successfully brought forward and in the subsequent election, and introduced the first coalition Government within the British Isles since David Lloyd George in the early 1920s. It is fitting that we have, by coincidence, in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery official representatives of the citizens of the United Kingdom of which Scotland is a part.</P>
      <P>I am glad they are here to listen to these words of tribute, sympathy and solidarity which are directed towards the British people who have suffered a tragic loss. Donald Dewar will be missed throughout the United Kingdom, not merely in Scotland which is an integral part of that entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also shocked to hear about the death of Donald Dewar. On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his family, first and foremost, and the people of Scotland, a country he led to such great effect through the process of devolution.</P>
      <P>I visited the Scottish Parliament in the company of Robin Harper, the first member of the Green Party to be elected to a UK regional Parliament, who will be greatly saddened by the loss of Donald Dewar. He was a man who commanded respect from members of all parties represented in the Scottish Parliament. He will always be remembered as a father figure by new parliamentarians and those who continue to try to become used to the idea of devolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donald Dewar was very understanding and displayed an air of authority which gave a sense of confidence to the Scottish Parliament in dealing with the tasks it faces. He inspired others and commanded respect and I hope people in this country take some comfort from the fact that he identified closely with the trials, tribulations and challenges which Ireland, as a Celtic country within these islands, faces. There will be continuing dialogue between Ireland and Scotland which will build on the foundations he has laid. No doubt his memory will be revered for many years <Col N="1584" /> to come, given the pivotal role he played in Scottish devolution. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton will be aware that the Government completed a mid-term review of the Action Programme for the Millennium and that we have also just completed and published a progress report on the completion of our third year in Government. Progress on the Action Programme for the Millennium is kept constantly under review and I would propose to publish another progress report in June next year. A total of 3,000 copies of the progress report were printed and distributed. The document was issued to the media, Government Departments, Deputies and members of the public on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government's record, particularly in terms of <Col N="1585" /> the commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium in regard to transport, has been inadequate? Is he aware that the annual cost of traffic gridlock in Dublin amounts to £2 billion, that the Government has published five different blueprints for resolving this problem, none of which has been implemented, and that 12 months ago the Government promised to double the number of taxi plates but that not a single additional plate has yet been issued? Is he also aware that the Government promised to have in place 11 quality bus corridors by 1999 and that, to date, only three have been delivered? Does the Taoiseach realise that there is a significant and troubling gap between rhetoric as far as the Government's record on transport is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the national development plan, approximately £2.2 billion has been set aside for transport initiatives. Progress has been made in respect of a range of those initiatives, some of which were delayed inordinately and others, such as the airport bypass, in respect of which no action was taken during the lifetime of the previous Government because of a failure to sign the public orders. When we entered Government we were faced with the necessity of concluding consultations on the port relief tunnel, construction of which, thankfully, is about to begin, and ensuring completion of the M50 south-eastern motorway &ndash; it is proposed that the port tunnel will be linked to this motorway <i>via</i> the east coast route. Progress has been made in respect of these issues.</P>
      <P>We have put in place a number of important initiatives to improve the bus transport system in the greater Dublin area. A total of 150 new buses were delivered last year and in recent weeks over 200 were delivered for 2000. A further three quality bus corridors have been opened which brings the total in operation to six.</P>
      <P>We have also put in place an entire range of other initiatives. The issue of suburban rail development is being addressed in two distinct parts, namely, the short-term strategy and the long-term development programme. Progress has also been made in terms of the suburban rail strategic review. The DTO only completed its overall report in September and the National Roads Authority, with its increased resources, has produced an updated report.</P>
      <P>We are finally beginning to address the deficiencies of the past. Of course, everything that is wrong will not be put to rights but there is a blueprint in place for the years ahead. I am sure Deputy Bruton has seen the enormous amount of work proceeding on roads, etc., throughout the country. Unfortunately, Dublin was left behind for some years because in some instances there was a lack of resources while in others objections were made to particular developments. However, genuine improvements are now being made and these will continue in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that if <Col N="1586" /> the Luas proposals as prepared by the Rainbow Government had proceeded as planned, that system of transport would be in operation today? Is he further aware that a plan for a light rail system similar to that put forward by the Rainbow Government was announced in Montpelier in France and that that system is already functioning? Does the Taoiseach not agree that people who commute to and from Dublin are paying a very high price for the indecision, procrastination and political posturing of the Minister for Public Enterprise and her colleagues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how Deputy Bruton can make such a contention. When we entered Government in 1997, I do not remember seeing any completed light rail orders in respect of the Luas line. Work had not even commenced on those lines and it would have taken 18 months to get the project up and running. Therefore, the earliest that anything could have happened would have been in 1999. As it stands, work has commenced this year.</P>
      <P>Traffic in Dublin is extremely heavy and there have been enormous increases in volume. Thankfully, however, the Minister for Public Enterprise has got on with a range of initiatives and substantial progress has been made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Deputy Bruton is correct that if the Minister responsible for the airport bypass had dealt with the file rather than leaving it sitting around for over 12 months, that road would have been finished. Unfortunately, that was not the case.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> What are the Government's plans to review the proposals on educational disadvantage contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium? Would the Taoiseach agree that the commitment in the programme sits ill with the High Court judgment in the case of Jamie Sinnott where a substantial award was made against the State for being negligent in the provision of educational support for a child suffering from autism.</P>
      <P>With regard to the commitment to the delivery of a new targeted support package to disadvantaged primary pupils from September 2000, how does this tally with the situation in probably every constituency where there are children in schools suffering from ADHD, attention deficit syndrome, who cannot attend a full day in school because the required number of special needs assistants are not deployed? Would the Taoiseach agree that ADHD and other disabilities constitute educational disadvantage if the supports are not there? What specific measures will be put in place to address this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Educational disadvantage has been substantially addressed through enormous <Col N="1587" /> and substantive resources to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in schools. However, individual questions should be submitted to the Minster for Education and Science. The case mentioned by the Deputy has been before the courts for six years. It is one of many very sad cases. I readily admit that we need to give more specialised care in many areas.</P>
      <P>The way we deal with people with disabilities and various forms of disadvantage in our education system is very different even from a decade ago. This subject was raised last Thursday on the Order of Business and the Minister for Education and Science will deal with questions on it later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy John Bruton in relation to infrastructure, does he agree that whereas in the past the constraints under which we all had to work were primarily financial, there are now constraints in our domestic procedures which need to be reformed? What action does the Government intend to take when it receives the reserved judgment of the court case in relation to Dublin taxi licences on Friday? Can he consult the Attorney General to ensure there will no longer be a legal obstruction to the implementation of the Government decision, or take steps in consultation with the administration of the courts to ensure that, irrespective of the outcome of any court deliberation, the matter will not take its place in some long queue like abandoned passengers in the middle of Dublin city at three o'clock in the morning? Can we not fast track the deliberation of justice to the point where an effective decision is given and the necessary taxis are on the streets?</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach is probably being advised that such a reserved judgment is due. Can he indicate what decisive action he intends to take to avoid the tragedies we have seen and the great hardship people must undergo in Dublin city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Quinn's views on this matter. I hope we get a clear judgment on Friday so that we can move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for the courts if the judgment is appealed. I do not see how we can get around that. The judgment will be examined on Friday.</P>
      <P>Our estimation is that a doubling of the number of taxis would do an enormous amount to alleviate the obvious difficulties throughout the week for visitors and for the Dublin public. We were originally told this case would take six months to go through the courts, in which case it would have been settled early in the summer. If the judgment does not provide the answer we will have to look at other contingencies. We must wait for the judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the projects he outlined today, prioritising road projects as he did in the first part of his answer, will take the lion's share of the transport provisions in An Action Programme for the Millennium? Given that taxis, buses and even the most basic cycling and pedestrian requirements are not being provided, the plan needs to undergo a reality check. He must recognise that this is a very wet country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise that the projects outlined in the action programme do not reflect the priority transport needs of this city which are that people be encouraged to use modes of transport other than the private car? Will he ensure that such projects are fast tracked and not held up as is currently the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The current plan of the Dublin Transportation Authority is to prioritise buses, trains, Luas and DART in its early years. Our policy on taxis, bus lanes and cycle corridors is already clear. All reports on Dublin transport in the past decade &ndash; and it applies equally throughout the country &ndash; show that the problem will not be solved simply by building more road infrastructure in cities because this simply leads to an increase in the number of cars on the road. The public transport aspect must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Very few cities have solved the public transport problem. We frequently cite cities which have done so but I have visited a few recently and found them appalling. Public transport must be given due regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>One indicator of the success or otherwise of his policies is the commuting time from a town like Portlaoise which has increased substantially from approximately one and a half hours when the Taoiseach came to power to more than two hours today. This is indicative of very little co-ordination of Government policy. Matters are not proceeding in a manner which will give rise to public confidence.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in a rural constituency like Laois-Offaly there has been an annual decrease of 10% in the number of people holding medical cards? Hundreds of medical cards have been withdrawn since June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of An Action Plan for the Millennium, does the Taoiseach accept that this is at total variance with the concept of a caring Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there are now approximately 1.6 million cars on the <Col N="1589" /> roads. It is for that reason that the main national corridors are now being developed and fast tracked. We now have the resources to do that.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not possible to have a national infrastructural plan in the absence of two essential requirements which the Government has not yet provided &ndash; a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy without which the viability of investments cannot be assessed and a national spatial development strategy to say where things should go and where we want people to live. Does the Taoiseach not agree that the absence of a greenhouse gas abatement strategy and a spatial development plan for the country make their plan for the millennium, or any millennium, unviable because it lacks the essential detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The greenhouse gases abatement strategy will be published in the month of November. On the spatial survey, all of the reports which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, outlined in the House, are now available. It was a fact that, over the years, and certainly until I started co-ordinating the infrastructural committee, the NRA, CIE, Dublin Bus, the light rail project and bodies involved in the issues such as the taxi service and the DTO policies generally were not working as one unit. It never happened. It did not happen when I was a member of Dublin Corporation or down the years. It is happening now for the first time. These bodies work together on their plan and it is a co-ordinated plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;when we were being exorted by the squire of Kinsealy to tighten our belts. Do I detect from the Freudian slip from the Taoiseach that he supports the view recently put forward by Mr. John Fitzgerald, the city manager for Dublin, that in the context of Dublin, an overall authority is needed that would have responsibility both for transport and planning? Since the Taoiseach is sitting adjacent to the present Minister for the Environment and Local Government he might indicate whether the document that was recently launched by the Government on transportation in the Dublin region would be backed <Col N="1590" /> up with the necessary legislative authority to make it happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say yes. We have moved very quickly with it and the recent plan. We moved on it within a week of its presentation because they had given briefings throughout to the infrastructural committee. We need to continue to do this. I would not say for a minute that we will resolve these matters in a year or two. Frankly, I think it will take about a decade but if successive Governments continue with the kind of blueprints that are there now, we will get there. The reality is that, in Dublin anyway, most of the CPO road planning areas of the 50s had not started until the 90s. That is the hard reality. Issues that were documented in the war years were not looked at for about 30 years because of lack of resources. Those are the kind of issues that are now being dealt with, thankfully. Given the road plans that were there, at least we have the land where we can move on these issues in a large part of the city and county area.</P>

Constant monitoring is in place to ensure that the programme is implemented. That is the way it operates. On the issue of homelessness, the strategy and the resources have been given to the local authorities and many of them have moved on it already. On the matter being raised constantly in this House about how to resource the housing fund that helps the St. Pancras Housing Association and all the other housing agencies, it is working very well countrywide. Perhaps there is never enough accommodation but it is working. The resources have been given. On the matter of student accommodation, significant tax concessions have been given which have greatly expanded the number of student accommodations all over the third level sector.</P>

Ach tar éis dóibh an Ard Teistiméaracht a dhéanamh ní bhíonn cleachtadh nó suim ag cuid mhór de na daltaí sa Ghaeilge nó i labhairt na teanga. Bíonn cuid eile acu íontach maith. Cad é an tuairim atá ag an Aire ar na torthaí ag éirí ón Ard Teistiméaracht agus ag éirí ó labhairt na teanga? Cad é an tuairim atá aige ar dhátheangachas a bheith ag chuile mhúinteoir Gaeilge i scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha, i scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht agus i ngnáth mheánscoileanna ?</P>
      <P>An bhfuil scrúdú ar bith déanta ag an Aire nó á dhéanamh aige ar an mbrú a bhíonn ar chuile dalta Gaeilge riachtanach a fhoghlaim sna meánscoileanna?</P>

      <P>I will have to reply to the Deputy as Béarla. It is important to understand that the requirement in the case of Irish relates to the study of the subject. One can be awarded the junior certificate or the leaving certificate without achieving any grade in Irish. That has made the situation somewhat more simple for people who had a difficulty with Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to certificate examination results, it is generally felt that the junior certificate syllabus and the revised leaving certificate have led to an improvement in the learning of Irish as a greater number of students are taking the subject at higher level. On the percentage of students pursuing the higher leaving certificate course, 24% took Irish at higher level in 1990 and the figure has now increased to 31%. That represents an <Col N="1597" /> increase in the number of candidates to 16,955. The number of students pursuing the lower course has decreased accordingly. The number of students following the higher course at junior certificate level has increased from 30% to 40%. Some 9% of students are pursuing the new foundation level Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Níor thug an tAire freagra ar na ceisteanna a chur mé air. The Minister did not refer to the questions I asked. There are some 8,000 Irish teaching hours every day in second level schools. Given the pressure on students to learn other modern European languages, is any study being carried out on the methods of teaching Irish and the results? Are any studies being carried out in regard to the pressures being placed on students arising from the fact that Irish is compulsory? In light of the revised curriculum, particularly in Irish, and the progression of students from primary to secondary schools, the Minister is now presiding over a situation where Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna at primary level are expected to implement a revised curriculum in the Irish language in the absence of any textbook, facility or teaching aid which would allow them to do that. It is utterly shameful that the Minister would attempt to preside over this hypocrisy at the highest level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1998, the Government formally recognised the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Arising from this decision, children with autism are catered for in special dedi- <Col N="1598" /> cated classes in special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. Each special class operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has the support of a special needs assistant. To date, a total of 63 special classes have been established to cater specifically for children with autism and further classes are being established on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In some cases, children with milder forms of autism may be capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis. In such cases, the children in question are supported by the resource teacher service and by special needs assistants. Over the past two years, the number of resource teachers catering for children with special needs in primary schools, including children with autism, has been increased from 104 to more than 560. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from 200 to more than 1,400 over the same period. These developments represent an unprecedented level of growth in support services for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The judgment to which the Deputies refer runs to 69 pages and three appendices of over 100 pages. It deals with a range of complex issues and has very significant implications, not just for the education of children with special needs but more generally for the education system. The full implications of the judgment are currently being studied by the Office of the Attorney General and my Department. The House will appreciate that I am, therefore, somewhat constrained in commenting on this specific case and indeed on the question of compensation. However, arrangements have already been authorised for an immediate payment to enable a special home based programme of tuition and support to be put in place for Jamie Sinnott.</P>
    <P>The case in question has highlighted the State's failure over many years to make adequate provision for the education of children with special needs. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to remedy these deficiencies. As a first step in this process, I am pleased to inform the House that I am now preparing to take the following action. The immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism; a programme of specialised teacher training and an interdepartmental team of high level officials to co-ordinate our response to the needs of autistic children.</P>
    <P>I also propose to appoint an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in this area and to liaise with the work of the special task force on autism, which I recently established and which will report to me within three months. In addition, I will appoint a clinical <Col N="1599" /> psychologist to advise me on the needs of individual pupils with autism.</P>
    <P>The measures which I am now putting in place, coupled with the report from the task force on autism, will provide a basis for the development of an urgent response by the State to the needs of children with autism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information although there is so much that it is somewhat difficult to absorb. How many autistic children does the Minister estimate to be currently in need of specialised education? How many children are receiving this specialised education and how many have yet to receive it? Will the Minister indicate the number of people, in the same category as Jamie Sinnott, who have been failed by the State in not having their educational needs met and who, on foot of the High Court judgment, must now receive specialised services? Will the Minister give us a commitment that the task force report will be made public as soon as it is available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will cater for children aged three years and upwards. This is the first time in the history of the State that this will be done. I am <Col N="1600" /> announcing it in the House. Perhaps the Deputy would be more impressed if I announced it outside the House but we are constantly asked to announce matters in the House. I am saying in reply to these questions that this is what we are doing. It is a major change and will be available for all those who wish to avail of it. Children are in many different circumstances. In the case of Jamie Sinnott there were different ideas on how to approach the problem. Some children are in the mainstream system but I do not have the detailed figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to cater for everyone in my calculations, for those who want to come forward for the extended periods and so on. I will also train teachers. That issue was highlighted recently. However, there will be people who will have their own ideas on the way to proceed and they will need to be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shortall who has raised a number of interesting points. The courage of Mrs. Sinnott is an example to everyone. The State has been found negligent. I do not believe that neither the Department of Education and Science nor the Minister does not have a response to make on the issue of an appeal. I would like the Minister to confirm that he will not appeal the decision. If it goes before the Supreme Court it will be another two years before a decision is made and the action the Minister has outlined will probably be delayed. Will the Government appeal it? Will it set up a compensation tribunal to deal with these very sensitive and personal cases that are coming up for hearing before the High Court? Is there a budget for that? With how many does the Minister expect to deal?</P>
      <P>Arising from what Deputy Shortall said, how much is the budget for teacher training? Who will do the training? How many are to be trained? I welcome the Minister's announcement regarding three year olds and upwards but when will that commence? Is there a structure within the Department? Is there a section with a head of section? How many people are working in it? What is the budget for that? What the Minister said about training contradicts what is happening in other areas where training is required, from principal teachers down the line. He is presiding over a Department where training is least important and where the process of getting matters online seems to have a higher priority than results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to October 1998 children with autism were not recognised as having a distinct educational need. They were catered for in facilities which also catered for children with emotional disturbance or mild learning disabilities. Since 1998, we have established 63 special <Col N="1601" /> classes. That is ongoing. The money is being provided. The Government has said that it recognises an automatic right for special needs generally.</P>

      <P>I do not know. The training period will not take very long. They will go into training now. We are making a start this afternoon in this House. Do not ask me about what has been done because nothing has been done. I said autism was not recognised as having a distinct educational need. It was grouped with everything else. Since October 1998 there has been a gradual build up under a special needs unit in my Department covering all special needs. In this case, the development and recognition of the educational need has not been adequate in any part of the country. As far as the health boards and the Department of Health and Children are concerned, we relied on people to give us advice on best treatment and so on. I am appointing an internationally recognised expert within my Department and will then be in a stronger position to relate to the work of health boards, the Department of Health and Children and so on.</P>

      <P>I met all three teacher unions, the ASTI, INTO and TUI in April 2000. I subsequently met the INTO in July 2000 and I have arranged to meet the TUI later this week. At these meetings a range of issues, including general industrial relations issues, were discussed.</P>
      <P>However, there is a formal conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers, revised last year, which provides an agreed formal mechanism for progressing all industrial relations matters. The scheme is used extensively and operates very well. There is a monthly meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council at which the three teacher unions, school management, my Department and the Department of Finance are represented. The council also operates a system of sub-committees which meet between these meetings. There is, therefore, a continuous processing of industrial relations issues, many of which are resolved to the participants mutual satisfaction. In the event of disagreement, the scheme provides for third party facilitation or arbitration if necessary.</P>
      <P>This framework for the processing of industrial relations issues is in keeping with best practice in this area. This is the most effective way to deal with industrial relations issues. I am, of course, available to meet the teacher unions as necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I am not sure he is aware of the extent of the deep frustration and concern within the teaching profession. It is weighed down with bureaucratic details, no recognition for effort or performance, and so on. This frustration and malaise will be demonstrated shortly through industrial action. The Minister said he is available to meet the teacher unions as necessary. Given that the ASTI is balloting its members on industrial action, why has the Minister not called it in to discuss the matter? If the strike takes place and teachers are on the streets five or six times before Christmas disrupting the education cycle of students and with potentially further serious consequences in the spring, what mechanisms are available to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to resolve the matter? Why is it that the ASTI is advertising for teachers? Why has the Department not taken on board the shortage of teachers? The Minister should recognise that there is deep-rooted concern that this service, which should be the jewel in the public service crown, is grossly under funded and that the professionals working at the coalface are seriously under remunerated and under resourced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitration board recently rejected the ASTI's claim for a 30% increase. It also indicated that it would be desirable that the <Col N="1603" /> teacher pay claims should be addressed as part of the benchmarking process at the earliest possible date. We have made it clear that there is scope to address the questions raised by the ASTI, TUI and INTO as part of this process which was initiated at the end of July. Like the rest of society, including children, the teaching profession has been adapting to change and participating in a big way. It is open to the ASTI to participate in the benchmarking process under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In the meantime we have proceeded to pay the increase of 8.5% in salaries and allowances to all teachers from 1 October. There will be further increases of 5.5% in October 2001 and 4% subsequently. I appeal to teachers to resolve the outstanding issues within the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>A range of initiatives are under way in third level colleges to enhance student completion rates. There is a lack of data available on student completion rates and the Higher Education Authority and the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology have commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake detailed studies of the issue of non-completion. Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the institute. The Department is funding these studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The studies being undertaken will consider a range of factors as to their effect on completion rates. The outcome of the research being under<Col N="1604" /> taken will influence future policy directions in this area. In the meantime the Higher Education Authority has included the issue of student retention within its targeted initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the institutes of technology sector I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives to assist the compilation of a database on attrition-drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues concerned. These initiatives include the establishment of a national committee on retention; the introduction of induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of at risk first year students; the provision of £1.5 million specifically to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector in 1999 and 2000; the allocation of £8 of the student services charge for projects linked to attrition and access; the assignment of a dedicated member of staff to work with students and staff to develop mechanisms aimed at improving retention rates.</P>
    <P>Considerable work is being done in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and the post-primary inspectorate in the Department to develop other positive actions in this area. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Guidance in Education organised a colloquium, Staying Power &ndash; Increasing Retention Rates in Higher Education, on behalf of the Department in November 1999. The publication of Staying Power was launched on 6 September 2000. Its recommendations will be the subject of further study and consideration by all relevant parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there is a lack of data on student completion rates. A study has been completed by a number of institutes of technology which shows a drop-out rate of between 40% and 50% among first year students. Two figures stand out strongly. The large majority of students who dropped out decided a few months into their first year that they had chosen the wrong career option. Many were also of the view that there was a lack of support within the college structure. What will the Minister do to improve the position on career guidance at second level? In many instances the problems faced by students in the second, third or fourth month of their first year at third level stem from the lack of career guidance at second level. Invariably the wrong course is chosen. This is obvious given that almost 50% of students fail to complete their first year in institutes of technology. What can be done to assist students once they have commenced third level? While it does not present a perfect picture, the data clearly show that students are choosing the wrong course and the necessary support services are not available once they take the wrong route.</P>

      <P>A recent study conducted by three institutes of technology shows a non-completion rate among first year students of approximately 37% which can be attributed to a wide range of social, personal, academic, institutional and financial factors. These include failure in examination; motivation, which often relates to the course preference of the student concerned; departure to another institution shortly after registration, which may prove beneficial; departure from college to repeat the leaving certificate to strengthen the position of the student concerned; poor course choice, which results in expectation not matching course experience; and various other personal and social reasons.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is a major problem. Money has been provided. First, we are trying to provide a substantial data base, which will show where people go and what happens. We have provided the money for that. Second, work is being done in the colleges. There are some excellent mentoring schemes, which are very valuable and in which the more senior students are involved. I will do anything I can and I appreciate the urgency of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 139 and 149 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in support of the National Child Care Strategy being led by the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, is currently engaged in a survey of spare capacity in all primary and post primary schools. The closing date <Col N="1606" /> for survey returns was Friday, 6 October. To date 758 primary schools, that is, 24% and 324 post primary schools &ndash; 43% &ndash; have submitted returns. Some 100 have indicated that they have spare capacity and are willing to consider the use of these rooms for child care purposes while 46 have spare capacity, currently being used for other purposes, which may have potential use for child care purposes. Detailed follow up on each positive response will now be necessary to establish the precise position in individual cases.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my letter to schools, I am anxious that spare accommodation would be used for child care purposes, where this is feasible and that any such accommodation would be made available to child care providers by the school authorities on a rental or leasing basis. The Department of Education and Science would be prepared to subsidise these arrangements through the provision of a financial contribution to schools towards additional heating, lighting and, as Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned, insurance costs. Consideration would also be given to providing capital grants for essential minor refurbishment works to make the premises suitable for child care purposes.</P>
    <P>To ensure an integrated approach, details of the scheme to support schools in this way will be finalised in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to this scheme, £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently finalising details of a scheme for this after school support service, in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. My Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach, Traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers and the vocational training opportunities scheme for unemployed people. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders, subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of those who have submitted returns indicating they will co-operate, there were 758 primary schools and 324 post primary schools. Some 100 have indicated they have spare capacity and are willing to consider the use of rooms for child care and 46 have spare capacity which is <Col N="1607" /> being made available for other activities, but child care could be part of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a huge need among local communities in this area, especially with regard to the provision of child care facilities? Does he accept that what he is doing is only scratching the surface of the problem? There are approximately 4,000 schools in the country. It is a question of harnessing that resource to their need. The question of insurance cover is a major inhibiting factor in developing the use of that resource. Will the Minister confirm he has plans to remove that and, in effect, provide insurance cover so we can encourage a greater use of the resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our schemes, for example, the VTOS, 795 students have availed of either full-time or part-time child care, involving 999 children and arrangements have been made for insurance or whatever. These are the elements that would be covered under a special scheme. The Government announced in July that a further £40 million would be made available for child care purposes as part of the anti-inflationary package. I understand the Taoiseach will shortly make an announcement on that. The details of the package have been worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that overall cover is provided? That would allow much greater resources to become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already providing that with regard to the ones in which we are involved. My Department would be prepared to subsidise the arrangement through the provision of financial contributions to schools towards additional heating and lighting and insurance costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Cover needs to be provided entirely for these purposes. Problems arise when other purposes are introduced to schools. That is what we would be covering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that we should talk about child care from a child centred perspective rather than as an anti-inflationary measure and that if there was a well thought out plan on providing proper child care services this confusion would not arise? Has he outlined to school principals how the Government intends to proceed in this regard? It has been brought to my attention that the circular generated a great deal of confusion because no clear undertaking was given with regard to subsidising the costs involved, nor did the circular outline the intended use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that it would have made more sense to clarify the position for <Col N="1608" /> schools with regard to the provision of 200 additional teachers, who were supposed to have been appointed last month, before asking the schools if they had spare capacity? What happens to schools who give up their spare capacity for child care purposes and receive an extra teacher from the allocation that is now due? Will huge confusion arise from that and will it lead to extra schools being allocated but there will no longer be spare capacity in terms of classroom space? Does he accept that a better way to proceed and use the spare capacity in schools would be to establish proper pre-school services in areas of disadvantage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see pre-school services develop in areas of disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be conscious of any developments in that regard. The State's requirements will have to be reviewed because if children with disability are to be included in the mainstream, rooms for one-to-one treatment or whatever will be required. Big change will be needed in this area.</P>
      <P>There has been planning with the VTOS and any other schemes in which we have been involved, and they have been properly organised. The Deputy mentioned the circular to schools. It outlines the costs that will be covered, as I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative to carry out this survey and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on providing money for child care. Does the Minister agree that money is being spent on the double on facilities which are already available in the community, such as sporting facilities? Adult courses could be held in primary and secondary schools after hours. New and existing schools should have strong links with the community during their planning stage so these facilities are not duplicated. The Minister said some of the supports are only for disadvantaged areas. Are those areas covered by the early school leav<Col N="1609" /> ing initiative or are they specifically designated as disadvantaged? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the schools which have been designated as disadvantaged to date. I hope to have the information soon on which we can allocate the further posts. There has been a difficulty with the data and the information. What happened the last time was that schools which were disadvantaged did not come within that scheme. This one is based more on the children. We want to ensure the figures are right as far as possible. I hope to have the rural and city ones ready shortly and they will come within that same category. As Deputy Shortall said, we want to extend this in the future but we want to make a start now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister can only take on one thing at a time. Does he agree it is a disgrace that hundreds of millions of pounds worth of facilities are lying idle at weekends and at night while sports and youth clubs are trying to raise funds to build halls and gyms for our young people? These facilities could be made available if funding was provided for caretakers. I ask the Minister to make these facilities available to the communities, as Deputy Keaveney said. The Minister should work on it and he should not limit his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We need local co-operation because management and control are local. I agree with the Deputy that we must free up a lot of space.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to ensure that happens as soon as possible. It relates to businesses, to the community and to other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the young people who need these facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on local will and management. Insurance is one of the key issues, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said. We are prepared to deal with that for the type of activities mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to make an announcement in the House that at the start of November ten areas will be selected where this scheme will be implemented and that it will be reviewed at Christmas? The Minister should set out the guidelines and call in the boards of management in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What criteria are used to determine disadvantaged status? The Minister should abolish this and deal with the disadvantage which exists in <Col N="1610" /> every school. I do not like any school being branded as disadvantaged because it can have different consequences. If the Minister and the Department were operating properly, they would have a complete database of the extent and range of that disadvantage and they would then be able to deal with it. However, pupils and schools should not be walking around with the brand of disadvantage on their backs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I am moving away from the concept of disadvantaged schools, which schools welcomed because they got extra resources and teachers. We are moving towards a child centred approach which relates to facilities and to the number of children with a disability or a disadvantage in the school. That is what the current study deals with. I expect to have that up and running within this Dáil session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all look forward to a time when schools are the focal point of the community and their facilities and accommodation are fully utilised seven days a week throughout the year. What discussions has the Minister had with the management bodies, school principals and the teacher unions about giving back the premises for community use and fulfilling the plans about which he is talking? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings on various topics and I have made it clear that this is the direction I want to see it going. However, there are many practical difficulties and issues to be overcome. I want children with disabilities mainstreamed within the system. This comes back to an earlier point about extra rooms and facilities for that purpose. I have made it clear to the people in the planning section of the Department that we must make provision for them in the future. As regards sports facilities, a number of schools are prepared to share their facilities, particularly the new facilities which have been built as a result of our economic growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister has got the message at this stage. There is an old saying that wilful waste makes woeful want. There is a great need and yet there is a great resource. Will the Minister take the message from the House that he should engage in a proactive policy to ensure that the 4,000 schools are used to best effect in meeting community needs and in contributing to the demand for child care facilities? </P>

      <Quest>his views on the recent results in history in the leaving certificate.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20965/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Grade patterns in the leaving certificate can and do vary from year to year. This is a feature of our examination system and reflects changes each year in the cohort of candidates, the test instrument and the marking scheme.</P>
      <P>Leaving certificate history grades over the past three years show a broadly consistent pattern. The percentage of candidates scoring a grade C3 or higher ranges from 61.6% to 67.5% at higher level and from 58.6% to 63.5% at ordinary level. The percentages of candidates scoring a grade E or lower varies between 9.0% and 11.2% at higher level and between 20.1% and 24.0% at ordinary level.</P>
      <P>The percentage obtaining a grade E or less at ordinary level in 2000, and especially the proportion of candidates obtaining a grade F or no grade, indicates that a relatively high number of candidates at that level fell significantly short of meeting the aims of the syllabus. On the other hand, a large percentage obtained high grades with 22.8% achieving grade A1 or A2.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently developing a new syllabus for leaving certificate history. The objective is to make the history syllabus more attractive and more accessible to students, particularly those in the lower ability ranges who would take the ordinary level syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the reply in relation to the statistics. It should be obvious to everybody that the teaching of history and its understanding as a valuable asset is critical to the kind of people we are. As Churchill once said, those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. Does the Minister have any views on the revision of the history curriculum which is currently being examined? In other words, does he expect a radical change from what is currently being taught and the methods of teaching? Is he happy with the context in which Irish history has been taught to date as against British or European history? We have a wonderful tradition here and a great reputation to stand on but if history is not taught properly in our schools, Oliver St. John Gogarty will be a pub in Temple Bar and Bloom will be a saint commemorated by silly clothes and too much drink on a summer's day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the high failure rate at the ordinary level is a cause for concern. It is not new and was a feature of results in the earlier years as well. It indicates, however, a need to revise the syllabus in order to increase its accessibility to students. This revision, which is being undertaken by the NCCA, is well advanced and it is expected that the NCCA will submit a revised syllabus to my Department for approval before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> It is envisaged that the underlying philosophy of the junior certificate history syllabus &ndash; this is in relation to the new leaving certificate history syllabus &ndash; with its particular emphasis on the use of source documents, will be extended to the new leaving certificate syllabus. Greater variety of approaches to the teaching of history will be encouraged and a greater choice of study within the history syllabus will be available. The new syllabus will also enable the study of local history which is not currently possible. They are the kind of directions it is talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the presentation of Irish history and in particular the presentation of Anglo-Irish history. We cannot rewrite history and we are not talking about an argument of revisionism but in view of the much improved Anglo-Irish relations and the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, a review is currently being undertaken of the way history is being taught in Britain, can we attempt to be sensitive and broad in the way we portray Anglo-Irish history? It is of enormous importance that young people from national school age up to leaving certificate get the broadest possible view of Anglo-Irish relations in the context of the better relationships that now exist. Unfortunately, many of the difficulties the Minister's colleagues, and previous Governments, have been dealing with from a conflict point of view stem directly from the one sided, narrow vision of history as portrayed in the history books and taught by the teachers through the old system. That needs to be urgently revised to take account of the new era and the new relationship that exists between these islands. What can the Minister do to bring that about?</P>

There was an increase of 6% in the numbers who got the C grade at higher level but over recent years the number taking history has been declining, which is a matter of concern. It warrants more attention and that is what the NCCA is doing. It hopes to produce a revised syllabus fairly soon.</P>

      <P>Is this the Bantry airport Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen and he will find out.</P>
      <P>The Government must ensure that this challenge is met to the satisfaction of all interests concerned. It must be seen to respond to the demands facing the providers of air transport and those bodies which provide the central infrastructure and services to the transport providers.</P>
      <P>It is also of paramount importance that airlines charges would be as low as possible to drive growth in their business. It is gratifying to note that Aer Rianta has not imposed any increase on the tariffs since 1987. However, with the abolition of duty free sales at airports, this may change in the near future. It was a sad day for Aer Lingus and all the Aer Rianta staff when the duty free shops closed. The duty free service was an added value to the airports concerned and was a great help in sustaining the airline companies and ensuring that necessary enlargements took place in the airports concerned to cater for the increased volume of airport traffic.</P>
      <P>The aviation business seems to have changed since the late 1980s with the liberalisation of air travel across Europe. The combined factors of competition and a significant increase in passenger numbers created a different climate. It is gratifying to note that since 1994, total passenger traffic has increased at an annual rate of at least 12% to 16.5 million passengers in 1999. I am pleased to note that the Government is continuing a programme of investment which was planned by the previous Government in 1995 and 1996 and major capacity enhancing projects at State airports, particularly Dublin, Cork and Shannon, initiated by the previous Government under this programme will be substantially completed at a cost of £360 million by the end of 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that those three State airports are made the flagships of our aviation industry. Without those three national airports this country would be much the poorer. We have seen how Cork Airport and Shannon Airport have grown to cater for the large number of passengers who pass through them. However, I urge the Minister <Col N="1615" /> not to put all her eggs in the one basket and ignore the plight and demands of other regional airports. There is an increasing need for the establishment of a regional airport in the Bantry region to cater for the three peninsular areas.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the Chair or the Ministers present that Bantry is the capital of our acquaculture and mariculture industries. The greatest impediment to those flourishing industries is the lack of a direct air link from the Bantry region to the cities of Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, London, Paris, Prague and Rome to enable processed products from those industries to be flown in in record time to meet the needs of restaurateurs and others. Time is of the essence for the products of our acquaculture and mariculture industries. If we could establish a direct air service from Bantry to the continent, our acquaculture and mariculture industries would expand in leaps and bounds. Such an air service could be promoted to encourage tourists to visit the south-west Cork region, which everyone in Europe knows is Ireland's riviera </P>
    <P>Bantry is the nerve centre of the south-west tourist region. One could envisage the vast potential that would accrue from tourism development, if an airport was sited in that region, which is more than 100 miles from Cork Airport. Given that the rail system serving the south west was hijacked about 50 years ago by the then Government, surely it deserves an air service to fill that vacuum. Everybody knows that south-west Cork is much the poorer since it lost its railway system, but what steps have been taken by successive Governments to make good the damage that was done to that region?</P>
    <P>South-west Cork is much bigger than several other counties, yet it does not have one mile of national primary route, no rail service, no roll on-roll off cargo service, even though Bantry would be the ideal centre for such a cargo service to the European continent. Before the foundation of the Irish Free State Great Britain boasted that Bantry Bay could hold its entire fleet. That highlights the vast potential in that region that has been left lying dormant for almost 100 years. One can imagine the potential that exists in that area if the necessary air and sea infrastructure was created. I urge the Minister to tackle this problem immediately by giving the green light to the establishment of a regional airport in the Bantry-west Cork region.</P>

      <P>Not alone would a regional airport in Bantry be of immense help to south-west Cork, it would also benefit my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, who resides on the north side of the mountain range in the village of Kilgarvan less than 20 miles from the area in which I am seeking to have an airport established. I hope Deputy Healy-Rae will row in behind me and back up my request for an airport to be constructed in the Bantry region which would mean he could motor across the Barreneen valley to Bantry in less than half an hour and be in Dublin within 20 minutes</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister hinted that she will consider siting an airport in Athlone. I will be pleased for the people of Athlone and the midlands if she succeeds in doing so. The people of south-west Cork need an air service urgently to promote and foster the development of that area, which has been sadly neglected in the past. If an airport was established in that region, Deputy Callely could fly from Dublin Airport to Bantry and enjoy his summer residence in Kilcrohane peninsula.</P>

      <P>Kerry has its regional airport in Farranfore and rightly so, as it is centred midway between Cork and Shannon, 60 miles from Cork Airport and 60 miles from Shannon Airport. Parts of the three peninsular areas I represent in south-west Cork, Beara, Mizen and Kilcrohane, are more than 100 miles from Cork Airport and that region does not have a rail service and its road infrastructure is very poor.</P>
      <P>I recently had the opportunity to visit Grimsby in north east England on a fact finding mission on behalf of the marine industry. I understand Grimsby has a regional airport with a modern train service with ten trains passing through each day and ten outgoing and ten incoming flights per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister agrees to my request. She stated that these policy proposals will set out a blueprint for future regulatory bodies and will be the cornerstone of ensuring public confidence in the independence and fairness of their operations. I understand that Aer Arann operates a very effective system of flights to the islands off the Galway coast and that it would be pleased to extend its service to the main islands off the Cork seaboard, Bere Island, Cape Clear and Whiddy Island, if an airport in the Bantry area was available to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she included in the Bill some of the recommendations for the proposals process, such as issues of transparency, independence and accountability. If she has such issues at heart I see no reason she cannot put Bantry in its rightful place by establishing a regional airport there. I trust she will carry out her promises to the fullest extent along the lines proposed.</P>
      <P>She also said that the commission will have regard to the necessary levels of investment in airport infrastructure, the requirement of sustainable and profitable airports and the levels of Aer Rianta's operating costs and expenses. The Minister went on to say that provision in the Bill would outline the regulatory objectives and reflect the policy concepts of the Department's strategy while also saying that section 10 outlines ministerial authority to issue policy directions of a general nature. One of the main suggestions is the inclusion of a regional dimension, which she hopes to carry out in the future.</P>
      <P>I want to pin the Minister down to those words of transparency. When she replies I want to hear if she intends to put the Government's money where her mouth is &ndash; that is, into the regional aspect of Irish aviation. I hope she abides by her promises in this area as the regions will benefit provided she gives the services necessary to those regions.</P>
      <P>The Minister is studying the prospect of using Baldonnel as a second airport for the Dublin area and surrounding counties. I remind her that every citizen in Ireland should be cherished equally, whether they live in Ballydehob or Ballsbridge and that we cannot all live in the confines of Dublin. We all know the serious difficulties that have arisen from the escalation of Dublin's suburbs but the Minister says she can develop two airports in Dublin. If that is the case, no region in Ireland should be left without an airport to cater for its hinterland. There are approximately 50 sections in this Bill, many of which are genuine and worthwhile, but I urge the Minister to look at the case I have outlined in a positive manner and I am looking forward to her reply to the request I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a new regulatory authority to be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation and that it will carry out the regulation of charges levied at Irish airports both by Aer Rianta and those levied by the Irish Aviation <Col N="1618" /> Authority in respect of the services rendered to aircraft for take-off and approach. The new commission will have responsibility for policy areas such as approval of airport and air traffic controls, approval of ground handling services and service providers at airports, the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing spots and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators.</P>
      <P>Anything that improves the operation of the aviation industry has to be welcomed and I know the operation of aviation is in safe hands when the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is in charge of it. Most people now have experience of travelling, but many people dread and have a fear of airports because of the sheer volume of traffic going through them. The world has become a much smaller place. My town used to be the place from which everyone left for America on boats and when one compares the length of time it took people to get to America then with flying there now, it is clear that flying has brought many countries closer. The Minister is keeping a close eye on this to ensure that the services that are provided are the best that can be achieved given the unforeseeable increase in the numbers travelling.</P>
      <P>Aviation has definitely helped the Irish economy. Job creation always occurs near a good airport, such as Dublin, Shannon, Cork, Kerry and Galway. Even in Donegal, Carrickfin Airport &ndash; which is a state of the art facility &ndash; has helped the development of job creation, particularly for Údarás na Gaeltachta. We in Donegal have little experience of airports but the little we have had is very important and it is important that we develop Derry Airport, which is a realistic option for my area. I know there is an ongoing struggle to develop an airport at Letterkenny which I would not oppose, but realistically we have an airport 20 miles away &ndash; half an hour from my area &ndash; while Carrickfin is two hours away from me.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her assistance in ensuring the air link was re-established from Derry to Dublin. It is not perfect but is long overdue and I implore her to ensure when the public service obligation, or PSO, is given, that we get a PSO for this route. I know her Department will be fully behind us and will fully endorse our needs. It may seem strange to hear someone from one constituency fighting for something not even in this jurisdiction, but I guarantee that the development of Derry Airport would have very positive repercussions for my constituency as 33,000 people in Inishowen are within half an hour or 45 minutes of Derry Airport. Very few people in Dublin could say they are within half an hour or 45 minutes of Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access is very important for us to have the chance to create jobs and bring in tourists. The last budget removed some of the travelling charges and that was very important. In the context of cross-Border co-operation, I ask the Mini<Col N="1619" /> ster to contact the relevant Minister in the North to examine the issue of the charges at Derry Airport and the airports in Belfast and Antrim. This substantially increases the price of flights at present. It is probably a matter for the Treasury in England as opposed to the Executive in Northern Ireland, but I would like to think that we would assist in the case for removing charges. It is one of the crippling factors in trying to establish the Derry to Dublin Aer Arann flight. Once the price of a flight increases to £109 for what I consider an internal flight, it is too expensive.</P>
    <P>I also implore that every effort is made to make airlines operate a system that can work. Too often flights have come into Derry with timings that could not work &ndash; flights left and returned in the middle of the day which was no good to anyone. In one sense, we have that at present. A flight leaves Dublin at 9.50 a.m. and another leaves Derry at 11.10 a.m. They are not much good to the vast majority of people who want to be in Dublin early enough to have a working day and leave late enough to get home for their tea. The timings must be appropriate and I implore the Minister, if she has a role in this regard, to apply pressure to ensure that airlines offering services provide appropriate timings. I will not support the provision of services which are no good to my constituents.</P>
    <P>The issue of working through Derry has annoyed those in other airports, namely, the Belfast City and Aldergrove. We should send a clear message that competition is good for any industry. Competition between Derry, Belfast and Antrim is the lifeblood of all three. I would like to think that we would have assistance from the other two airports and not efforts to try to prevent Derry expanding.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I record my sincere disappointment that the Belfast to Cork direct flight has gone. Jersey European had been running a direct flight. I understand Aer Arann might provide a flight but it would be <i>via</i> Birmingham. We are a small island but the time taken to travel by road and train from one place to another is too long and we need to become accustomed to the concept of hopping from one place to another within the island. I would like to think that pressure would be brought to bear &ndash; I note that two colleagues from Cork are present &ndash; to get the direct Cork to Belfast service up and running again. I am an hour and a half from Antrim and Belfast airports and the Cork to Belfast service was as good to Donegal people as it was to anyone else.</P>
    <P>I endorse fully the advance of Carrickfinn Airport, despite the fact that it is in a different constituency and is about two hours by road from me. Deputy Sheehan explained how large County Cork is and I would like to point out how large County Donegal is. The airport in Carrickfinn does not impinge on Derry Airport and <i>vice versa</i>. There is room for the two and both should be developed properly.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems with access to Donegal <Col N="1620" /> can be overcome within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement and I again congratulate everyone involved in that. I would like to think the position will continue to be advanced. My best role as a Deputy in my area is to keep applying pressure to Ministers such as the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who is very sympathetic to our cause and who is also in a position to work with the relevant Ministers in the North to deal with issues such as the direct air service, the train service from Dublin to Derry or Dublin to Donegal, whichever she prefers, and ensuring with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the development on a cross-Border basis of the A5 road which is not in great order at present and which needs vast extensions.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my sympathy and great sadness that Donald Dewar, the Scottish First Minister, has died. He had done a great deal for the Scottish people who have a great affinity for and links with Donegal. We would like to increase those links not only in terms of a Derry-Glasgow route and the expansion of existing services but also in terms of ferry services and direct links between Moville and Ayrshire or Scotland in general. Mr. Dewar will be very badly missed in Scotland. I hope they can overcome his loss to move on. Again I express my sympathy on his death.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, will continue to apply pressure to advance our airports. Ease of transport is very important. Having travelled recently and seen the huge numbers Dublin Airport is trying to deal with, a great deal of reshuffling can and needs to be done. I hope the Bill will assist in no small measure with the overall aviation industry. I am glad to reiterate my call not only for the Dublin-Derry service to get a PSO but also that it will be a worthwhile PSO with an economic cost and good timings. I congratulate Ryanair for the work it is doing out of Derry Airport. It is fantastic to drive for 20 minutes, get on a plane and, within an hour, be in London. If I could do the same when travelling to Dublin, I would be a very happy camper.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when we have a high level of aviation use. I hope that soon, like other countries, the use of the plane here will be as common as the use of the train &ndash; a service we do not have in Donegal &ndash; the car or the bus. We are nearly at that point. I wish the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, every success in her continuing battle to provide us with the best transport service.</P>

      <P>I am glad to contribute to the debate on this Bill. While the Minister is not <Col N="1621" /> present, I acknowledge the presence of her able deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, a fellow Cork man.</P>
      <P>The aviation industry is of worldwide importance and, especially in an island economy such as ours with its obvious problems of access, it is imperative that the aviation industry is as fit, lean and mean as is possible in taking on competition and providing an efficient and economic service to the public. In that sense, while I have some reservations about the Bill, I welcome the debate on the aviation industry in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the explosion in passenger numbers. It is phenomenal and is placing an enormous strain on all our airports. We are looking at year on year increases in passenger numbers of approximately 12%. Last year, a phenomenal 16.5 million passengers used Irish airports. Obviously, that figure is comprised of tourists, business people and others. Nonetheless, it is an increase which is placing an extraordinary strain on resources.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Aer Rianta has been caught off guard. Many of our airports are a disgrace and appear so to people visiting the country. Dublin Airport is a complete disaster zone. There are queues of people waiting for flights, passengers are falling over each other and the airport is poorly signposted. Aer Rianta has no excuse for that debacle. The finger can equally be pointed at most, if not all, other airports, particularly our international airports. The one possible exception is Shannon Airport in which, in the mid-1990s, a significant investment was made. However, that airport is probably significantly under achieving in terms of the number of passengers with which it deals. At other airports which are creaking at the seams &ndash; a development which was predicted long ago &ndash; Aer Rianta has been found to be lacking.</P>
      <P>I do not claim to know the entire gamut of organisations involved in and regulations proper to the aviation industry. However, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the commission for aviation regulation and the independent regulation of airport charges, including charges for terminal services provided by the Irish Aviation Authority. Therefore, it appears that, apart from the commission for aviation regulation which the Bill will establish, Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority will carry out certain functions in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When there are additional duties to be undertaken, it appears to be a national malaise that rather than adding them to the duties of existing authorities &ndash; in this instance Aer Rianta or the Irish Aviation Authority &ndash; we queer the pitch further by establishing further commissions or semi-State bodies. While there is a possibility of a conflict of interest in terms of the shareholding and regulatory responsibilities, I am still not convinced that this commission is necessary given that the Irish Aviation Authority already has significant functions in the area in question. That is <Col N="1622" /> only one from any number of examples I could provide where this national malaise of establishing new independent bodies with new chief executives and new administrative costs, with relatively few functions to carry out, has gone too far.</P>
    <P>In so far as there are duties to be carried out, the Bill seems to provide a framework to execute them and I do not propose to dwell on that matter. However, I will state that, for want of a better description, we appear to be engaged in poor economics.</P>
    <P>In terms of access to the country, as I understand it we have four international airports if one includes Knock. In addition there is a layer of regional airports and demands have been made for the provision of other regional airports. It is time to take stock and, notwithstanding the question of increasing passenger numbers, discover whether we are, by the promotion of additional or new regional airports, undermining the viability of existing international and regional airports.</P>
    <P>For example, there has always been a tension between the Shannon lobby and the Dublin or east coast lobby. It is undoubtedly true that any developments that will take place to improve Knock Airport in the context of Shannon or &ndash; this is the most ridiculous demand I have heard articulated recently &ndash; the suggested provision of a new international airport in Galway will impact on the viability of other airports. We do not need a series of uneconomically viable regional and international airports which would drive up the costs incurred by everybody seeking access to the country.</P>
    <P>To be more parochial and deal with the situation in Cork, I must state that a proper hierarchical approach to access to the Munster region is imperative in terms of aviation policy. It does not serve the area well to have regional airports seeking a status above that which they currently hold and thereby undermining the position of Cork Airport. If there is a role model one could use in this regard it would be to consider the regional airport in Waterford and Cork International Airport. There does not appear to be any tension or undue or unhealthy competition between the two. Any upgrading of Kerry Airport will have an impact on the capacity of Cork to act as a hub airport serving the region generally. We must be careful with regard to how we proceed in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal specifically with issues affecting Cork Airport. Aer Rianta is a disgrace in terms of how it operates Cork Airport. Politicians who represent Cork &ndash; a number of us are in the House &ndash; would acknowledge that fact while admitting that there has been an effective campaign mounted at Cork Airport in terms of getting us on-side with regard to the continued involvement of Aer Rianta at the airport. Once its shortcomings came to light, Aer Rianta's heavy hitters arrived at Jury's hotel in Cork, they summoned all local public representatives and <Col N="1623" /> impressed us with what they would do given that the airport's shortcomings had been uncovered.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport should occupy a position far in advance of that which it occupies at present. At one stage there were a number of parties interested in taking over from Aer Rianta and I do not doubt that they would have done a better job than that done by Aer Rianta. There was a suggestion that private commercial interests and both local authorities, Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, would become involved in the airport. As a member of Cork County Council I can state that we were favourably disposed towards this suggestion, particularly in light of our previous track record with Cork-Swansea Ferries. In the latter instance, we acquitted ourselves with considerable distinction in re-establishing the Cork-Swansea ferry link. Nonetheless, it appears at this stage that the future of Cork Airport is in the hands of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Last week I received an update on Aer Rianta's proposals for Cork Airport from the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, which contained one interesting observation with regard to trans-Atlantic flights into Cork. It was stated that since that there was no demand for such flights there would be no need to provide for an extension of the runway. Surely that is the essential chicken and egg argument because if we are to fulfil the demand that exists for trans-Atlantic charter flights and regular flights from Cork to the United States, we must provide the necessary infrastructure while simultaneously marketing in respect of and pursuing that business.</P>
    <P>The highest concentration of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe is located in the Cork area. More than 500,000 people live within one hour's drive of Cork Airport and there is great potential in terms of passenger and cargo traffic, an extremely lucrative area. To say that there is no demand and, consequently, no need to extend the runway is an extremely negative approach. Rather than acknowledging that more business could be done at Cork Airport, the Minister is saying she does not, of necessity, intend to invest there. She is kow-towing to the Shannon Airport lobby which should get up off its backside and try to attract business, of which there is a sufficient supply, in its own area.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport has been poorly served. The terminal building in the airport is regularly overcrowded to uncomfortable levels. The cost of flights from Cork to London, a busy route, is extraordinarily high and regularly twice or three times the cost of flights from Dublin to London. The Minister should take that fact on board and immediately try to resolve this situation. There is a need for more airlines to operate on that route in order that we can drive the price down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I state my support for the Bill, by and large. I particularly welcome the establish<Col N="1624" /> ment of an independent regulator to determine airport and aviation terminal charges and to be responsible for the allocation of slots under EU regulations.</P>
      <P>I cannot support section 46, not because it would open up military aerodromes to civilian use which could be considered on a case by case basis, but because we are passing that decision out of this House to a body which will not be answerable to this House. I speak specifically about the possible future use of Baldonnel as a civil airport. It seems as though every Deputy would like an airport in his or her constituency but this is not the case in Dublin. I do not know if a civilian airport in Baldonnel would be desirable. I do not know enough about aviation to make that decision. However I am not willing to pass that decision to someone else or to vote away my power to affect that decision until the relevant information is available to me, my constituents and all the people who will be affected by it. Information regarding the necessity and desirability of opening Baldonnel as well as detailed information on the implications for the people who live in the vicinity and particularly in the flight path, the safety and environmental implications and the extent of the noise impact on the residents of the area must be made available.</P>
      <P>This provision comes in a one sentence section under the heading, Miscellaneous Provisions. It would be easy to allow an apparently innocuous provision such as this to slip through. This is a major decision with far reaching implications for many people. The Minister would have no input into the future of the airport. Sometimes it suits Ministers to wash their hands of things and to place blame on an independent commission but we should think long and hard before we give away the power to make a major decision such as this.</P>
      <P>I watched the Minister last week deny any intent to do things by stealth and, in her disingenuous fashion, declare the only reason for the provision was to allow for civil flying training in Gormanston. Even if this is the truth &ndash; and it may well be &ndash; and the future of Baldonnel never crossed the Minister's mind, if this legislation is passed unamended the decision on the future of Baldonnel will be out of our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind admitting that I am not totally objective on this issue. The flight path for Baldonnel goes directly across the full stretch of my constituency and over my own home. Mine and the neighbouring constituency would feel the full impact. It is also possibly the most densely populated area of Dublin and we have reason to be concerned. Dublin Airport preceded the population settlement in the area and fairly rigorous sterilisation and maintenance of the sterilised cone areas has offered some protection there. To impose a civil aiport when people had bought their homes near what they assumed was a low usage airport and had settled in the area, some for generations, is a different proposition. I am not motivated by nimbyism. I have an open mind <Col N="1625" /> but I want to hear the arguments and the facts before I vote away our power.</P>
    <P>I have heard other Deputies speak forecefully in favour of a second airport for Dublin and I can empathise with that view. Easier access to an airport from the south and west of the city and from the south and west of the country would be very attractive. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Dublin Airport is overstretched, overcrowded and perhaps not performing to acceptable international standards. That has caused people to jump to the conclusion that a second airport is needed in Dublin. However that leap of judgment is not yet justified. The case has not been made. We do not have objective evidence of the need for a second airport. The problems of Dublin Airport may be due to poor planning, bad management or under-investment. It may be that solutions can be found within the airport to make it operationally more efficient. Until we have the analysis and the projections, the case made and the public debate held we cannot make a major strategic decision such as this.</P>
    <P>If the case were made for a second airport the next logical step would be to do a study to establish the most suitable location by looking at a variety of sites. If Baldonnel were a greenfield site it would be subjected to the most rigorous environmental impact assessment, public information meetings, a major debate, a public sworn inquiry and expert evidence and everyone's concerns would be listened to and satisfied. We have had none of this. We should not deprive the public of that process and of the necessary information before signing the decision away to an independent commission. Even the smallest public project is subject, if not to a sworn public inquiry, at least to some sort of public consultation.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the inadequacy of the road network in the area. Roads can be improved but one cannot clear the entire population of south County Dublin to faciliate a flight path. If the building of the airport is to be considered it must be done openly and in the light of the full facts. We cannot allow it to happen by default rather than intent. We cannot pass that decision to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a regulatory body to be known as the commission for aviation regulation. It will be responsible for the regulation of charges levied at Irish airports, charges levied by Aer Rianta and by the Irish Aviation Authority, all aspects of air traffic into and out of our airports and the services rendered to aircraft for take off and approach. The Minister has said the new commission will have responsibility for five policy areas &ndash; the approval of ground handling, the approval of service providers at airports, the granting of operating licences to air carriers, administration of the rules governing take off and landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. The commissioner will have regard both to primary <Col N="1626" /> and secondary legislation and to EU regulations which, more and more, influence this type of implementation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the appointment of an independent regulator. However I am conscious that decisions will be taken out of our hands and I am concerned that our influence on regional policy and regional investment, about which I am very concerned, will not be retained in this House. An airport is essential to the future development of any region. This question must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an independent regulator is welcome. For too long we have heard of disputes among Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Ryanair and so on. We have seen large advertisements in national newspapers in which Ryanair criticised Dublin Airport and its lack of facilities and many of us have experienced that lack. An independent regulator will help that situation. Decisions have been made without transparency.</P>
      <P>We hear about the issue of landing fees not being addressed in a fair and meaningful fashion. I hear constantly in my constituency in Cork that Shannon Airport's marketing budget is far greater than Cork Airport's. This means that immediately Cork Airport is at a loss. I would like to see a level playing pitch and the establishment of an authority whereby these issues can be resolved and the facts established.</P>
      <P>Last year the reports produced by Aer Rianta and by Ryanair outlined the confusion regarding a number of different aspects of the aviation authority. The Minister, in particular, is the single shareholder in Aer Rianta, Aer Rianta currently has a monopoly and the Minister also acts as the regulator. That is not a very healthy situation and it is important that we have an independent regulator for the benefit of all, particularly for the benefit of the consumer, that is, the air traveller.</P>
      <P>Generally the provisions of this Bill are in line with all the deregulation measures happening in other areas such as energy, transport, communications and even in broadcasting, which I have been following. It is happening across the board and must be faced and addressed in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>I note that when Deputy Yates spoke on this Bill before the summer he praised the regulator designate and was very impressed with his ability and approach and particularly his experience in anti-trust law. He believed him to be fair minded and very able to deal with any of the issues involved. I was pleased to hear him say that in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak on Cork Airport, a subject close to my heart. On every opportunity I have had in this House to speak on matters of aviation, I have addressed the situation in Cork Airport and I have raised it with the Minister on several occasions. There is a strong lobby in Cork, as Deputy Creed mentioned, regarding the future of Cork Airport. Initially the lobby was set up as Cork Airport Against Break-up, CAAB, when there was a threat, which has subsided now, that one or other of the secondary airports, Shannon <Col N="1627" /> or Cork, would be sold off as a separate entity. That was not well received in the Cork area. We believe that Cork Airport should remain under the umbrella of Aer Rianta. It has benefited from being in that position and Dublin Airport, as we saw from Aer Rianta's report last year, is one of the most successful airports in Europe. It made £48 million. Cork Airport is not that successful but it is very essential from a strategic point of view to the future development of the regions.</P>
    <P>I would be opposed completely to any sell-off or part-privatisation of Aer Rianta because our airports are an essential part of our infrastructure, particularly as we are a small island nation on the edge of Europe and we do not have any land connection. Since we are the only nation that does not have a land connection to the continent of Europe our airports are essential. We cannot cut ourselves off and it is essential that we retain them in public ownership and that they are not sold off in any form. We have heard a great deal of comment on this &ndash; there is still comment being made &ndash; but I hope it has receded somewhat.</P>
    <P>Last September 12 months, that is, 13 or 14 months ago, the chiefs of Aer Rianta came to Cork and outlined to the public representatives and the chamber of commerce and all interested bodies in the area their future plans for Cork Airport. There was some suspicion at the time that this was an effort to diffuse a situation regarding a proposed bid for the purchase of the airport. At that time, we were given Aer Rianta's plans for Cork Airport, which were very acceptable. Anybody who has travelled through the airport will realise it is bursting at the seams. Its passenger numbers have increased substantially. It cannot cope with or cater for the passenger traffic. There are similar problems at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has its plan for the development of Cork Airport but we have seen little or none of that investment, particularly in terms of the passenger terminal, multi-storey car park or infrastructural developments which are essential to the future of the airport. Recently I and all the Deputies in the area received a communication from the Minister which I was very pleased to read. It stated that Aer Rianta plans to improve the infrastructural developments in Cork Airport which will cost more than £60 million over the next five years. However, we are disappointed with the timescale. I and my colleagues will be closely watching all developments in this area.</P>
    <P>The communication states that the investment plans will comprise four elements &ndash; airfield, passenger terminal, cargo facilities, which are also a very important part of Cork Airport's usage and traffic through the airport, and access to the current status relating to each of these elements. The airfield runway has already been overlaid and widened. However, we would like to see the extension of the runway being addressed. Recently I heard a story about an airbus, fully laden, which overshot the runway. With all the <Col N="1628" /> debris churned up, the airport had to be closed down for a number of hours until everything settled. We have the agents and the service seeking to come into Cork Airport but the runway is not long enough to take a fully laden airbus. I would like to see more emphasis on the extension of the runway because it will also open up the possibility and the provision of transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in her reply regarding transatlantic routes, that discussions have been ongoing since 1996 with regard to European US aviation relations on the issue of a common aviation area. Ireland will continue to be opposed to the idea of a transatlantic aviation area because particular measures have been in place under Ireland's bilateral air service agreement. Currently the Minister states that airlines can operate charter flights from the US direct to Cork without the requirement of a stop at Shannon but there is no indication from any airlines serving Cork Airport of a demand for the provision of a runway extension. As Deputy Creed outlined, that is a ridiculous situation. If we have the runway and the facilities, then we can market the service and attract transatlantic routes into Cork. Currently one cannot fly on a transatlantic flight from Cork &ndash; one has to drive to Shannon or Dublin. Anybody who travels the road to Dublin Airport knows that it takes at least five hours to travel by road from Cork on a good day. There would be a strong demand for transatlantic flights from Cork Airport but tied up with that is the matter of the extension of the runway. We should not wait until we have the demand. W should act now and provide the services and we will attract the facility.</P>
    <P>Regarding the passenger terminal, the plan is to have the capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers by the year 2003 and to facilitate further expansion for growth in numbers of up to 5 million. That is very welcome news. The Minister tells me a dedicated design team is working on the specification for the new facility. However, we were shown plans last year for a whole new facility. I am at a loss to see why it is still at a design stage when we saw the scheme last year. I understood at that time that the initial scope of the design was finished and that it was a matter of detailed design and putting the plan in place.</P>
    <P>The development of a multi-storey car park facility is essential. Currently there is only a surface car park in Cork Airport and the Minister refers to the fact that additional car parking spaces have been provided. If she is referring to the car parking with which I am familiar, she should be aware that at some points one can be half a mile from the terminal and the surface is shingle on mud which turns to muck if there is rain. It is not an adequate car parking facility for passengers using the airport. Cork Airport is on a hill and is quite windswept. As there is not a bus serving the terminal, people must walk and on rainy days they get drenched walking to the far end of the airport to and from the terminal. <Col N="1629" /> We need a multi-storey car park with covered access to the passenger terminal.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport is badly in need of upgrading. It is being neglected by Aer Rianta. We have heard much criticism of Dublin Airport which is still creaking at the seams although it has been extended. Shannon Airport is in a better position, but Cork Airport has certainly been neglected and is in need of immediate investment. There is a strong lobby among the workers and people in Cork who are concerned about the airport. I regularly receive telephone calls, particularly after weekends, about the flights and congestion at the airport, the difficulty in parking cars and people having to queue outside the terminal building across the car park for check-in. It is not satisfactory and if we are to move forward and attract new services into the airport we need some sign that the Government is serious about its commitment to Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to include examining the cost of air fares within the remit of the commission. It is expensive to fly from Cork to London, with fares up to £200 depending on the flight. I do not know how the airlines decide the different standards. It is far more expensive than it is to fly Dublin-London and it does not make sense to me. The Dublin-Cork return flights are excessively expensive, ranging from £92 if one books early, to £120. We need to encourage more people to travel and use intercity links and we must address the cost of flights as people will not be attracted with current fares. We are a small nation, our roads are congested and it would be beneficial if we had links between our airports. However, those that exist are excessively expensive and the Minister should address this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the main thrust of the Bill, but would like to use the opportunity to address the issues concerning our regional airports, particularly Cork Airport. It is an essential part of our infrastructure and is essential to the development of the region in terms of overseas investment, tourism and for the benefit of the consumers and travellers living in the area. Investment is necessary, as people are losing faith in the commitment of Aer Rianta and the Minister to the future of the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. I pay tribute to and congratulate those involved in the development of our airport structure which I and others have inherited. I welcome the views expressed by Members about the importance of air transport, given that we are an island nation on the periphery of Europe, are members of the EU and given the role we play in the international market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago my father recalled that when Dublin Airport was being established, the Taoiseach of the day, Mr. de Valera, and the Minister, Mr. Lemass, were told they were cracking mad to consider Cloghran outside Dublin as a location. Not so long ago I recall the great debate about Knock Airport and I have great admiration <Col N="1630" /> for Monsignor Horan who, in his own words, went on a wing and a prayer to develop the airport. Listening to Members I am somewhat amused at the manner in which we refer to our airports and how they are tucked under the belt. I pay tribute to those who had the dedication, commitment and vision necessary to put airports in place at a time when people did not fully understand the importance of having such important infrastructure as part of the transport network.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the establishment of a new regulatory body to be known as the commission for aviation regulation. It will have responsibility for five main policy areas, all of which have already been covered, namely, the approval of airport and air traffic control charges, the approval of ground handling service providers at airports, the granting of operation licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. All these areas, and the associated issues, are extremely important and, therefore, this is a very important Bill, especially given that we as an island nation require the best integrated transport network, including an air transport network as a key component of that infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the Minister acknowledged that we are critically dependent on efficient, reliable and cost effective airports which can meet the needs and demands of our rapidly expanding economy. I congratulate the Minister on inviting wide-ranging discussion on how best to address the regulatory process, particularly in light of the liberalisation of air services in recent years, the likely further developments and what is clearly recognised as rapidly growing passenger numbers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that the policy proposals in the legislation will be the cornerstone in ensuring public confidence in the independence and fairness of the commission's operations, which is very important. One of biggest single issues in terms of the Bill must be meeting statutory and professional standards. It is also important that we acknowledge the role of the Irish Aviation Authority and the fact that we have enjoyed a very good reputation as a provider of quality, safe and efficient air traffic services. We should acknowledge and pay tribute to those who have been involved in the development of the statutory and professional standards which have led to our excellent reputation as airline operators and carriers.</P>
    <P>On airport and air traffic control charges, the Minister has stated that the regulation of charges will be carried out in a manner which will facilitate the development of cost effective and efficient services to cater for the reasonable interests and needs of airport users and that the commission is obliged to engage in a consultation process with all interested parties prior to deciding on charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> I have a particular interest in the Dublin region and am grateful to be in a position to enjoy the benefits which accrue from the tremendous facility of Dublin Airport. I hold a different view to that articulated by some of my colleagues in that I believe that the operators and the management teams in both Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta have done a tremendous job in regard to the provision and delivery of airport services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not make false promises in hangars on the eve of an election; our record speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>I welcome the committed investment of £350 million for development in Dublin Airport. Some issues remain to be addressed in regard to the airport and I have pursued these over a number of years. I regret that we have not been more proactive, particularly in regard to the number of employees and passengers who travel to and from the airport. It is vital that Dublin Airport, like the airports in most other European cities, would have a direct rail link from the terminal building to the city centre. Many of my colleagues in the Dublin region want to see that development. We are all <i>au fait </i> with the Dublin Transportation Office's proposals in regard to the overall transport network for the city but I believe that a direct rail link from the airport should be given priority as it would alleviate a great deal of traffic pressure on the north side of the city. Such a link should be interconnected with other transport service providers to ensure that those travelling to and from the airport could avail of their required mode of transport without difficulty.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor the departmental officials will be surprised if I take this opportunity to refer to a proposal which now rests firmly with the Department of Public Enterprise. Free travel for the elderly was a superb idea when it was first introduced but air travel has become a vital component of transport services in the 21st century. I stated that publicly last year, having carried out a great deal of consultation and research on the matter and my views have been endorsed here today.</P>
      <P>I worked closely with Aer Lingus and Michael O'Leary of Ryanair on this issue in an attempt to identify how best we could provide free air transport&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little hope of that with Ryanair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Deputy has put that comment on the record and I am sure Mr. O'Leary will respond to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite feasible to allocate a percent<Col N="1632" /> age of spare capacity on airlines to elderly people wishing to travel abroad to visit friends and relatives or merely to go on holiday. Such people should be invited and encouraged to use this spare capacity at a very nominal rate.</P>
    <P>When I began to research this matter, there were two issues outside the operators' control, namely, the £5 Revenue charge and the airport handling charge. Having met a number of people in the industry, I met with the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise, both of whom have been very positive in their response to my desire to extend the free travel scheme. I also discussed the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am delighted that the £5 Revenue charge was abolished for all airline users in the budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to air traffic control and airport charges, I urge the commission to provide for sufficient flexibility to ensure that should the Minister of the day wish to extend the free travel scheme to air travel, it would be possible to do so. I have made a submission to the Minister for Public Enterprise outlining the numbers of people who could avail of this scheme and the costs which would be involved. It is possible to meet my proposals in regard to the extension of the free travel scheme for people who hold a free travel pass. If operators are prepared to participate in the scheme along the lines I have outlined, this House and the commission should facilitate that. I look forward to developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators, will the Minister outline what will be the commission's role in this area? Will it relate only to those involved in air transport? We have a number of tour bus operators and tour companies and it is important that such service providers are staffed by adequately educated individuals. People may not know the local history, culture or places of beauty and so would not be able to point them out to visitors. Perhaps the Minister will consider how to ensure travel agents, tour operators and guides are adequately qualified. I look forward to her replying to me in detail, in writing, regarding this issue and that of licensing and bonding. The new commission will approve ground handling and service providers at airports. I draw attention to the concerns expressed by ground handling operators and their unions regarding existing requirements, likely future developments and health and safety issues.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been comprehensively debated. I welcome the Minister taking into consideration the various competing demands and interests when considering the Bill. I am pleased to note she sought to strike the middle ground and provide a sound economic and regulatory framework within which the new commission will work. The balance will be seen as a core concept in her approach to the legislation that will be brought forward. I congratulate the Minister and wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Col N="1633" />
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It spans a key area of the economy and, in the north-Dublin region, the key centre of economic life. For that reason it is a Bill to which we must give the closest scrutiny and about which the Labour Party has grave reservations.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport has become, to some extent, the symbol of Fingal county. The new county development board is using the flying raven, the symbol of Fingal, in a motif that expresses the way in which the airport represents the heartland of the development. The airport processes in the region of 14 million passengers each year, more than one million a month. It is just behind Manchester Airport which processes approximately 19 million passengers. The main hub in Britain, Heathrow, processes some 44 or 45 million passengers.</P>
      <P>In the hinterland around the airport, in estates such as Airways and Clonshaugh Industrial Estate &ndash; I live close by &ndash; there are 15,000 jobs directly related to aviation. Recently planning permission was processed for the new M50 digital park which will rival Citywest and Parkwest on the south and west sides of the city respectively. We will have a hi-tech, highly designed digital software employing industry in that location. Side by side with that is the planning of Fingal manufacturing park.</P>
      <P>One of the key problems in the north Dublin region &ndash; the Nordubco group of partnerships across the north county would put it clearly as would the city of Dublin development board and Fingal development board &ndash; is that neither the Minister nor the Minister of State has come forward with the requisite level of future planning or resources for the airport or its hinterland. In planning terms it has been a disaster and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is primarily responsible. I am not aware of any plan for the development of the airport zone. Environmental issues in the area around the airport have not been looked at. I note the comments made by the Aer Lingus directors in their 1999 report and their concern for the environment. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten years ago many Dublin representatives were briefed at Dublin Airport by the then Aer Rianta management team and asked to provide the basic resources for a second terminal. Four or five years ago those of us in the greater Dublin, Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow areas had another briefing on an extended terminal with provision for a second terminal. During the past three-and-a-half years, the Government has dragged its feet on these developments with the result that the plans rightly signalled a decade ago by Aer Rianta management have been held up. This summer we saw the utter chaos that faced visitors and those returning from abroad. I had such an experience when I returned from holiday. Aer Rianta staff displayed tremendous professionalism and did their damndest to try to keep traffic moving as flights arrived every few minutes. They worked hard and operated under <Col N="1634" /> intolerable conditions to keep people moving and get out baggage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's mal-administration is responsible for that. It is due to her lack of competence that we have ended up in such a position. The staff have rightly, as did my colleague Deputy Stagg, connected safety issues on the ground with safety issues in the air. If they are operating in hopelessly over-crowded, chaotic buildings it will be easy to make significant mistakes which could have catastrophic consequences.</P>
    <P>While this was going on for the past decade we had the machinations of people such as the McEvaddy brothers and various politicians with significant roles in this Government who partook of their hospitality in their villa in France, people with ideas for second and third terminals and a grotesque attempt to influence Government at the highest levels to curtail and disrupt the performance of Aer Rianta, one of our best semi-State bodies. We have had an astonishing spate of rezoning which might still be the subject of investigation by the Flood Tribunal where people tried to lump in land that had no connection with the airport to industrial and commercial development so that private operators and speculators could set up their own car parks and terminals. The Minister presides over a chaotic mess which is an example of her failure.</P>
    <P>The background to this Bill is the determination of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to privatise Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus. I was delighted to hear that my Fine Gael colleague is completely opposed to the privatisation of Aer Rianta. There is a determined effort to sell off all our national assets &ndash; priceless national infrastructure which is to be sold off for a song. The two major Irish air transport companies, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, are competing well against each other. As in the area of telecommunications where British Telecom and Vodafone will shortly subsume Esat Digifone and a large chunk of Eircom respectively, within a few years we may end up with two foreign owned &lsquo;duopolies'. My party is, therefore, correct to criticise the Bill and be wary of its key elements. The lifeline &ndash; the word used by many Deputies &ndash; of this 80 billion euro economy is air transport, both cargo and passengers. Clearly, this key strategic asset must be maintained in public ownership.</P>
    <P>Determined efforts have been made to privatise the Great Southern Hotels Group. The Great Southern Hotel in the Dublin Airport complex, one of the most distinguished buildings in the area, is both beautiful and well run. It is a fine hotel which provides an immense service in the general north Coolock-Clonshaugh area. Despite the fact that it is both successful and profitable, there are people at the Cabinet table itching to get rid of it. There is a mantra and determination to privatise, no matter what the cost. The Minister, for whom I have regard, may not be in control of her Department; I sometimes think that the person at the heart of this movement in the Government is not, as many commentators seem <Col N="1635" /> to think, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, or the Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, but the Taoiseach who is content to preside over the vandalising of the cupboard of national resources.</P>
    <P>In spite of massive pressures, I congratulate Aer Rianta and its hard-pressed staff for running the airport as well as they have in recent months. Aeroplanes literally arrive every two minutes. While we appreciate economic development, due to Government incompetence workers are being placed under unnecessary stress.</P>
    <P>I also warmly congratulate Aer Lingus. As can be seen from its report it had a very impressive year in 1999 which saw a significant increase of 7% in profits and 12% in overall turnover to more than 1 billion euro. With its six A330s it is now carrying almost 1 million passengers on the vital transatlantic route to the United States, one of our key markets. Many people fear that the central core in the rush to privatise it, is that somebody wants to cherry pick this traffic, not for the benefit of the nation, but for the benefit of private interests. I also welcome its great achievement of an increase of 18% in traffic on continental routes and 11% on the London route, the busiest in Europe and one of the busiest in the world. Aer Lingus has played a full role in this achievement. On 1 June it became part of the famous One World group linking it with distinguished airlines such as American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finn Air and Qantas. The group carries 200 million passengers each year between 550 cities and 130 countries.</P>
    <P>The recent performance of the Aer Lingus work force has been extraordinary. They have responded vigorously to the challenge presented by the growth of Ryanair and other private operators for which they deserve our commendation. Their demand for a greater portion of the revenues of Aer Lingus is in many respects justified. It is fair that cabin and other ancillary staff who have made the recent 1999 Aer Lingus report possible should receive a decent portion of the additional revenue generated and be rewarded for their great achievement. The fate of Aer Lingus in my region as well as in Cork, Shannon, Knock and other airports is closely linked with that of the nation. Its efforts to ensure higher quality and better standards in recent years have paid off, for which I congratulate the work force.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a person to the position provided for in the Bill prior to its enactment is, as Deputy Stagg said, both extraordinary and outrageous. To what extent will the person concerned be accountable and independent? The previous speaker referred to tour operators, an area in which there is a need for much greater accountability and which should come within the remit of the Departments of Public Enterprise and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. While on holiday in Spain during the summer one of my constituents became very ill and had to be <Col N="1636" /> transported home by air ambulance. The family had to meet the cost involved, £10,000. Such an obvious risk should be covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 11 which provides for the possibility of a three person commission. Clearly, the idea of a one person commission is ludicrous. By availing of the expertise and ideas of a number of individuals there might be some possibility of success. I have little confidence in the various decisions made by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Ms Etain Doyle. That is the reason I look on this Bill with a jaundiced eye. Everyone now regards the sale of the second mobile phone licence for £15 million as an outrageous travesty. Over the period in question at least this amount of damage has been done by Esat Digifone and now BT in tearing the edifice of Dublin and many other cities apart. A total of 56 telecommunications operators claim the right to dig up the streets of Dublin. There is one road in my old ward of Beaumont which has been dug up 58 to 60 times in the past year. This arises from the fact that key public infrastructure has not been paid for by these companies. The decision in question was made by Ms Doyle initially in the case of Esat Digifone. Is it any wonder that Mr. Esat O'Brien rambles off into the sunset with £280 million leaving us to face a gigantic British company which has obtained access to much of key infrastructure for a song and a pittance? It seems the new proposals on unravelling the loop are an attempt to totally crucify and hamstring Eircom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another decision that will come back to haunt the Government is the recent decision to have a beauty contest for the third generation mobile phone licence. Through a very impressive economic formula the British and Germans have raised many billions of pounds for their national exchequers. We have taken a different path on the basis that we want the companies concerned to have sufficient capital to enable them to offer low prices, but instead of low prices there is chaos in relation to capital. In other words, we are not getting the money. In return they have obtained access to our infrastructure for nothing and are offering us high prices, the highest mobile phone prices in western Europe. We have the worst of all possible worlds. During the summer, following discussions with some of my constituents, I referred the issue of the sale of the second mobile phone licence for £15 million to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I also asked him to look at the recent announcement of sale by way of beauty contest, of the third generation of mobile telephone licences. Deputy Durkan may be interested to know that he said he will not be able to look at it until after the Minister for Public <Col N="1637" /> Enterprise and the Minister for Finance have made a final decision.</P>

      <P>The State is being ripped off by this process. In another eight or ten years we may have to say where we stood on this matter. The record of the telecommunications industry is not much of an advertisement for what is proposed here regarding the aviation industry. My party's spokesperson, Deputy Stagg, was right to express the gravest reservations about proposed developments in this area.</P>
      <P>The proposals for CIE and public sector broadcasting also give rise to grave concerns among the public. It is important that we do not end up with a new private monopoly, or a private duopoly, which we will shortly have in telecommunications. It will threaten developments in that industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome sections 26, 27 and 32, which deal with the attempt to give the new proposed office some authority when dealing with the overall level of charges. There has been some response from Aer Lingus to the concerns expressed by the AEWU and other trade unions on the issue of pensions in the semi-State sector. Three years ago the Minister promised to index link retired workers' incomes across the public sector, yet nothing has been done and the Taoiseach does not want to know. Any time I have raised the matter with him he has said the workers will get £100 per week. That is his response to the question of indexation. However, it is not indexation. I have huge files from constituents who are former Aer Lingus and other semi-State workers. The response of Aer Lingus to this matter, dictated by the Government in preparation for privatisation, is not good enough. The Minister should return to this issue.</P>
      <P>Like the Tanaiste and Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Harney I grew up very close to Baldonnel Airport. All my life I have lived close to an airport. The general feeling among the public in north Clondalkin &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte and others can speak for them &ndash; and north Kildare is that major infrastructural developments in the Dublin area should be concentrated at Collinstown and Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I take a special interest in Dublin Airport because many of my constituents work there, or if they do not they work in industries related to the airport. I am, therefore, very interested in its well being and future development. I hope the Bill will assist in addressing the massive mis-management of the aviation services over which the Minister and the Government have presided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of congestion at Dublin Airport is unreal. The Bill gives to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the power to regulate airport charges and aviation terminal service charges. It <Col N="1638" /> might also address the regulation of the provision of services while managing the long-term development of the airport's regulated services.</P>
    <P>The chaos which the commuting public currently experiences at the airport is dreadful. The inadequate transportation modes, with no rail link of any kind, are disgraceful. The deficit forces passengers to be dependent on bus or car transport, with the majority opting for car transport. This is placing an unnecessary strain on the road network servicing the airport. It also strains an already overburdened Belfast corridor.</P>
    <P>When passengers eventually arrive at the airport, often having experienced gridlock on the M1, they are diverted to car parks which are a considerable distance from the terminal building. While a bus pick-up system operates, most passengers find it unsatisfactory. They are also of the view that they are overcharged for the facility. The problem is compounded when passengers have a friend or family member drop them at the start of their journey with a view to collecting them at the arrivals terminal on their return. However, because cars are not allowed access to the arrivals area, the driver collecting the passenger must park the car in the short-term car park occupying a space unnecessarily while the passenger is collected.</P>
    <P>The terminal buildings are now so strained that on occasions during the past summer it has been reported that tour operators have been forced to check in their passengers from the car park because it was unsafe to allow any more people in the terminal building. Fears have been expressed regarding the personal safety of passengers within the terminal building. It is often the topic of conversation at the airport. The airport management company must ensure that the services they provide are adequate to meet the demands of passengers and related persons.</P>
    <P>The airport is a very important factor in the economic life, not only of the country, but especially of the north County Dublin area. Some 12,000 jobs are provided within the airport confines with some 35,000 jobs reliant on the economic activity directly generated.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that the levels of service and comfort cannot be faulted. First impressions to foreign travellers are always very important, but, unfortunately, the current impression is not a good one. The commission must set charges which realistically allow for the expansion of facilities at the airport, ensuring viability and sustainability. Airport landing charges must be set at a reasonable economic level, which allows the market to be competitive while not subsidising any other sector or carriers. Each must be empowered to reach maximum passenger figures while fairly contributing to the long-term well being of the communal asset.</P>
    <P>The commission should be allowed to set and regulate charges at commercial airports which have through passenger numbers of less than one million, as proposed. It is the hope that the transfer of control of travel agents and tour operators <Col N="1639" /> to the commission will result in the development of a team of staff who understand and appreciate the various aspects of this business, and that its expertise will be such as to allow for better and enhanced interaction with the service providers to assist the travelling public get the most from these bodies while allowing the travel agents and tour operators the capacity to prosper and enhance their commitment to the industry.</P>
    <P>The operators of the airport must live in harmony with their neighbours. The noise factor at Dublin Airport is becoming a major issue for the residents in the north-east area of Dublin. Estates such as Sutton Park, Bayside and the whole of the Sutton and Baldoyle areas complain of serious jet engine noise invading their areas. It is pollution on a serious scale which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Proposals are before Fingal County Council to provide some 2,600 houses on the old race course in Baldoyle. Dublin Corporation has before it at planning stage, proposals for 2,000 housing units on lands adjacent to the Baldoyle racecourse. Directly overhead are the airport's air corridors or flight paths. A serious noise factor awaits the new people coming into the area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to welcome new constituents if they have to face a serious noise pollution problem. I read some time ago that grants were made available to residents within the vicinity of one of the London airports to insulate their homes against this type of pollution. Perhaps the Minister might consider doing something like that so people's houses will be properly insulated. The noise pollution from jet aircraft is unreasonable and people should not have to live in such an environment. The Minister could also take the matter up with the local authorities, particularly when new houses are being planned so that proper insulation against noise pollution will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is timely, necessary and important. Dublin Airport caters for 14 million passengers. Over the past year we have seen numerous consultant reports on airport charges. Each person who sought such a report got the answer he or she wanted. If one side was arguing that airport charges were valid <Col N="1640" /> and the same or less than those in other airports, the consultants' report seemed to show that was the case. Ryanair published its report and it got the answer it wanted which showed that the charges at Dublin Airport and the other airports were over the odds.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has pressed for the appointment of an aviation regulator. Deputy Yates, our former spokesman on public enterprise, welcomed the Bill when it was published in June. I also welcome the appointment of the regulator, Mr. Prasifka, who worked with the Competition Authority and who was one of a number of people who left it. Everyone seems to be abandoning the Competition Authority. I am glad he is bringing the expertise he brought to the Competition Authority to his job as the aviation regulator. The legislation provides for three commissioners. Is it the Minister's intention that other people will assist Mr. Prasifka or will he be a one man band?</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's opinion of the other functions included in the Bill? The main function is outlined in section 7, namely, to regulate airport charges and aviation terminal services charges. I know the legislation allows for the expansion of those functions which are currently the responsibility of the Minister, such as approving arrangements for ground handling services, arranging for the allocation between airlines of landing and take off slots at airports, licensing Irish airlines under EU licensing regulations and administering the travel trade protection scheme through which travel agents and tour operators are licensed and bonded. How many functions will be handed over to the regulator? I would not like to see the Minister stripped of all her functions. I often wonder what will be left for the main Department to do if regulations are put in place and ombudsmen and regulators are appointed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could keep us informed about the threatened airline pilots strike and how the airports will function if that strike takes place. I know there will be a meeting tomorrow morning between management, SIPTU and Impact. It is important to keep the public fully informed of the progress of those discussions. There is a threat of a work stoppage on 17 October. People must know if that will happen well in advance of making their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the assurance I received from the Minister in a reply to a question I tabled at the start of this session that, contrary to some newspaper reports, fire safety arrangements at Dublin Airport are adequate and satisfactory. A recent newspaper article gave rise to a great deal of concern about safety arrangements at Dublin Airport and a public complaint was made about it. The Minister in her reply assured me that the arrangements fully comply with the national standards of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is important for the Minister to continue to give that assurance to the travelling public. I have also spoken to Aer Rianta about it and Aer Rianta has assured me that all <Col N="1641" /> fire safety arrangements at Dublin Airport are adequate.</P>
    <P>As a representative for the area in which Dublin Airport is situated, I find it difficult to separate advertisements and fact. While it may be legitimate to criticise other airlines and airport management, I urge everyone using Dublin Airport and the other airports to steer away from incendiary language, such as that used by Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair. He said he would like to use Semtex at an Aer Rianta board meeting. That is not the type of language business people should use. It is legitimate to criticise if criticism is due and it is valid to rant and rave across a table or on the public airwaves. However, people should not diminish themselves by saying the only way to get rid of Aer Rianta management is to put Semtex under it.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has been referred to as the jewel in the crown of the public service. For many years it was seen as a model of how public companies should be run. Its management sought new opportunities to improve the economic welfare of the company and it expanded into duty free shops and airport management all over the world. It assisted emerging states in eastern Europe to develop and manage their airports and to train their staff. It created what became known as an Aer Rianta person. It was like Aer Lingus. Just as we almost knew what airlines had used Aer Lingus to train their cabin staff, we knew an airport where Aer Rianta had been involved in training and providing services.</P>
    <P>I am depressed at the atmosphere at Dublin Airport. There is at least one reason I am getting so many complaints. I would like the Minister to examine carefully the combined or separate roles of the chief executive and the chairman of the board of Aer Rianta. There are severe criticisms of the atmosphere at Dublin Airport and in Aer Rianta. Why have things changed there? Why are people unhappy? Why, over the past 12 months approximately, did 150 of the top and middle staff of Aer Rianta leave the company and go elsewhere? These people got very good training and often got access to third level education to get degrees and diplomas. They have left the service and we could not afford to lose them. I realise there is a great deal of movement of staff everywhere because there are opportunities in various new areas of industry and people who are trained are head-hunted, but there are other reasons. People are telling me they cannot stay in the company.</P>
    <P>I attended a function the other evening for a senior manager of Aer Rianta and it was sad to hear him say publicly that he was not retiring, he was leaving. The Minister will know of whom I speak. This was somebody who, as general manager of the airport, did tremendous work. Along with the former chief executive, he introduced all the positive, consumer friendly measures in the airport &ndash; the Christmas decorations, the art festival, the availability of staff throughout the airport to assist passengers in every way, the availability <Col N="1642" /> of people who could clear the trolleys and provide the internal networking of transport, etc. All these innovations were brought in over the past ten years but unfortunately in the past two years there has been a change. It is palpable when one walks into Dublin Airport and I do not know the full extent of the reason for that other than people telling me there is too much involvement by the chairman of the board. I have to say that here, because if I do not say it here I will say it outside this House. There is a sense that the management of the airport is not being let get on with the job and that the chairman of the board will have to pull back and do what a chairman of a board should do &ndash; direct the policy at board level and let the management of the airport and the management of Aer Rianta in Dublin Airport be run by the managers.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has to say about that. I know the chairman has had an extra five years added to his appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>He was re-appointed. I have met him many times and I know he has the airport's best interest at heart but I ask the Minister in the strongest terms to examine what is going on in Dublin Airport and see whether a discussion can take place with the chairman of the board to allow the managers to manage the airport and for him to do his job as chairman of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be dishonest if I did not let the Minister know the seriousness of the situation and how angry many of the staff are about the way the airport is being run. The complaint from people working in the airport is serious and if we do not do something about it quickly, not only will 150 people have left by the end of next year but 500 staff will leave to find other jobs. Some of the brightest and best people are leaving the Aer Rianta company and that is not what the Minister wants when she is preparing this company for change in the way it is run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summer months have been atrocious for people using Dublin Airport. I cannot put it any other way. The service, the overcrowding and the delays have been atrocious. I know the Minister has met the chief executive and the chairman of the board about this problem and in fairness, because traveller numbers have dropped somewhat, there is now a bit of a breathing space. I also know that negotiations have been completed with the airlines to move on to the new check-in desks and with Aer Lingus to take over the existing area. Ryanair has agreed &ndash; I will believe it when I see it &ndash; to move to the new desks but it wants to continue to do something in the old area. That is a matter for the management to sort out but that is the crucial point. It is for the manage<Col N="1643" /> ment to sort out this matter, preferably not on the public airwaves and in an incendiary way.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of understanding that Aer Rianta as a company runs the airport but the services that are provided in the airport such as baggage handling and check-in facilities are managed either by an airline or a company like Servis Air. I have told the chief executive of Aer Rianta that he cannot get that message across. There is no point in crying to me or to anybody else. We are not in charge of whether there are hundreds of passengers crammed into the baggage hall. People see Aer Rianta as the managers of the airport and it is up to them to make sure that those who have responsibility for the baggage handling, whether it is Aer Lingus, Ryanair or Servis Air, run their business properly and make sure the area is safe for passengers. There is confusion about this and Aer Rianta, perhaps unfairly, gets all the blame because it is the overall company but other companies must take some of the criticism that has been levelled at Aer Rianta management in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>It suits them to shunt it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does. Not long ago I spent four hours &ndash; from 8.30 p.m. to 12.30 a.m. &ndash; quietly and without any fanfare walking around the airport looking at all the facilities. Unfortunately, many of them were not in service. I am glad to say that since my visit many of them are now in service. One of the issues I highlighted in the airport was the bad signage and I understand that as a result of my recommendation, the airport has taken on a company to examine the signage. When people get to the airport they need to know immediately where to go.</P>
      <P>Does the aviation regulator have any role in customer service? I know he will have a role in setting the charges for planes that are landing on the apron but I do not know, and I wonder if the Minister will tell us, whether he will have a role in doing a stock-take of the airport services for the people using it. What about services, for instance for the woman who is on her first trip, who has never been in an airport? We all tend to suspend a certain amount of our intelligence when we get into an area like an airport and we hope that somebody will tell us where to go. An airport can be quite intimidating and some people are already nervous because they have to travel. Even before all this work is finished, the airport must become more managed. An impression must be created for people coming into Dublin Airport that it is being managed but I am sorry to say that impression has not been created all summer. I hope that will change as a result of all the publicity this issue has received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to something Deputy Joe Cosgrave mentioned. During my visit to the airport I spent about three quarters of an hour in the tower with the air traffic controllers. It is a <Col N="1644" /> fascinating place. I do not know whether anybody else in the House has spent any time in it&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it was fascinating to watch them, as we have seen in movies, calling the planes and directing them in. I accept that the issue of slot scheduling is something Aer Rianta and companies have sought for some time but the Minister announced this as a kind of knee-jerk reaction to the criticisms of her and the airport. I have received complaints to the effect that travel companies have decided on their brochures for next year. The slot meeting is held in November every year and I know the Minister's intention is to have the new person in place before November so that he or she can attend the slots convention that is held annually, but travel companies are way ahead of that. They have already printed their brochures. They had to because they are selling their holidays. I ask the Minister not to do something which will not work just for the sake of appearing to do something. Every airport catering for more than ten million passengers probably needs to have slot scheduling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>For public safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind about that, but the Minister should not just announce it and expect it to happen when it is too soon to do it for next year. She might have to wait until next year's slot scheduling convention to get it working properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I welcome it is because when I was in the tower with all these really skilled people talking to the pilots bringing in the planes, I asked why the people in Portmarnock were suffering so badly from excessive noise from aeroplanes given that the turning point for Dublin Airport is between Baldoyle and Portmarnock. If pilots flying into Dublin took that turning they would not fly over the houses in Portmarnock. I was told they fly over the houses there because they have visual landing in Dublin Airport. When the weather is good and they can see the flight path, they do not have to fly to the central line, to which planes are normally directed by air traffic controllers, to come in to land. If the weather is clear, they take a circular path to land at the airport. When a resident of Portmarnock telephones the airport to inquire why he or she was woken up by a plane flying overhead at 1 a.m., he or she cannot get a valid answer. I know the answer to that question. It is that the pilots of such planes land visually and are not obliged to follow the central path line which would take away most of the aviation noise from built up areas. If a regulation is not introduced to cover planes landing in Dublin Airport, I warn the Minister that proposals she might have for its expansion and the building of a second runway will be viciously opposed by the people of Portmarnock who could build up a strong campaign. <Col N="1645" /> Residents of Portmarnock cannot sit in their back gardens or sleep at night due to level of aviation noise. Parishioners at an evening Mass recently thought that the church roof would collapse on top of them because the plane flying overhead was so low they could practically see the threads on its wheels, which were down ready for landing. The Minister needs to examine the control of air traffic into Dublin Airport. Slot scheduling will help, as it will mean that all planes will have to come in the correct flight path directed by the air traffic controllers.</P>
    <P>There is no appeal mechanism in the legislation. Section 38 allows for a judicial review. There is a case to be made for putting in place another appeal mechanism that could be availed of by people who may wish to appeal against a decision that may be made by the regulator.</P>
    <P>We want a rail link built from Dublin Airport to the city as quickly as possible, not in the time frame of the long drawn out plan the Minister has announced many times. She needs to find a way to build such a rail link. It is a joy to travel to airports in many European cities, such as London or Amsterdam, and to commute by rail link from those airports to the centre of those cities. We should be able to provide such a rail link and perhaps Aer Rianta could investigate an innovative way of providing one. It is extraordinary that we have not been able to provide one up to now. We need a rail link to Dublin Airport to improve the access to that airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill, which is needed to address the difficulties and changes that arise in the aviation sector. Necessity is the mother of invention. As time passes, changes must be made to many sectors, air travel being one of them.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a Commission on Aviation Regulation. A late Member of this House used to refer to such a commission as a quango. I hope this new commission will not become a quango. I and other Members have queried whether regulatory bodies set up under previous legislation come under the control of the House. I note the Minister has powers over this authority, but will she answer questions in this House on the work of that commission in the future? Based on past experience of such matters, I speculate that she will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to preclude a Minister from answering questions in the House on the work of such bodies, but the answer we usually get to such a question is that &ldquo;The Minister has no responsibility to the House&rdquo; on such a matter. That is a phrase with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar in his current and previous capacities. I am not criticising the holders of offices, but that is how the system works. We need to cotton on to the notion that the public find it difficult to understand why the Minister concerned has no responsibility to the House for such bodies. They also find it difficult to understand why an elected Member cannot ask a Mini- <Col N="1646" /> ster about a matter of this nature. The farther we go down the road of creating satellite institutions that are not accountable to the Minister and for which the Minister is not accountable to the House, the greater the problem will be for us. One could speak for longer than the 20 minutes allocated on this matter.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers raised the question of the regulation of slot schedules at various airports. Some speakers also referred to the licensing of carriers, which is covered in the Bill. It is important to note that one of the serious and growing problems not only in our airports but in European airports is the ever increasing traffic at various airports. While that leads to serious congestion and discomfort for passengers, it also gives rise to possible safety problems. As more and more passengers use airlines, it follows that the slots involved will be more closely linked and there will be less space between take off and landing and on international routes. It is quite common to board a plane in Dublin Airport and to have to wait for an hour or longer on the tarmac, which causes passengers discomfort and those who cannot keep to their time schedules to be extremely annoyed. I accept addressing that problem is not in the hands of our authorities, but we must make it clear to others that we have to be able to live as well and that as an island nation we face difficulties other countries do not.  We need to be able to get on and off this island reasonably efficiently and safely. There are only two ways we can do that, by sea or by air. It is commonly indicated that Dublin Airport has to await clearance for take off and landing slots from air traffic controllers in London, Brussels and elsewhere. That is fine provided we do not become victims in this area. I hope in the review that will take place under this legislation it will be possible to home in on that aspect of air traffic control and to address problems in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree with those speakers who referred to Dublin Airport as being extremely congested. It was dangerously congested during the summer. If one arrived in the airport on a Sunday morning during the summer, one would see many students and tourists travelling to and fro and queues of people all over the arrivals area. I cannot understand how basic health and safety requirements can be complied with in those circumstances. If anything went wrong, such as a fire breaking out, one would not be able to achieve optimum safety standards. We need to examine that situation as it is developing.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it is not possible to have a check-in area away from the airport. While that may require a special transport system, improvements have been made in the standard of coaches that service the airport. Other speakers mentioned the underground systems that serve other airports throughout the world. They provide efficient services and enable commuters to get to and from airports with a minimum of delay. Notwithstanding that, consideration should be given to providing an alternative <Col N="1647" /> check-in facility to ensure passengers are checked in in an expeditious, reasonable, efficient and safe manner. The degree of traffic and people congestion around the airport buildings is a problem that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The cost of air travel may be a moot point, but there has been considerable improvement in this area over the past ten to 15 years. Not so long ago it cost the best part of £200 to travel to London, but competition brought about a reduction in cost. However, it is odd that the advertisements for transatlantic routes show that it must be cheaper to fly over land than water, as one can travel to and from New York and Boston for a fraction of the cost of travelling to Europe, though I cannot understand why. Every time a plane leaves Dublin Airport for Brussels it is full and the same on the return journey, so it is not true to say that planes are flying to Europe half empty or at a loss; they were fully loaded on almost every flight I can remember over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. The curtain is moving further and further down the plane depending on the number of people prepared to pay more. Something needs to be done about this and I know a committee of the House is to look at the issue of air costs. If one compares the cost per air mile of the transatlantic routes with the European routes there is a huge difference and I am sure it has nothing to do with the usage of the European or London routes. This is an issue that bears examination as more and more businesses depend on air travel. An island nation like ours has only two options: by air or by sea. People in the UK can take the train to Europe, but our options are more limited. Despite the Celtic tiger we could find ourselves at a disadvantage if air transport to Ireland became more expensive.  We must keep an eye on this and look at issues contributing to costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Airport charges are a contributing factor to costs. I know that to run an airport effectively and safely one must have charges, but those charges must be at least as competitive as charges in other countries with which we trade. In addition, it is high time, given the growth in the economy, that there is ready access to the capital cities in the euro zone and the EU in general. Business people complain they may have to make two stops in a journey; they may have to travel from Heathrow or another airport to reach their final destination. It is appreciably more beneficial to anyone travelling, but business people in particular, to get a direct flight. The various airlines and aviation authorities, including our own and the commission proposed by this Bill, should get together as soon as possible to figure that out. It would be hugely beneficial to our economy for both importers and exporters if we could smooth <Col N="1648" /> the path for those travelling regularly on business. It is common to see such people travel with their computers and they have genuine reason to move quickly, efficiently and in a cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the issue of traffic around Dublin Airport. Although people may raise their eyebrows, the time may come for us to consider having another airport in the country. It is easy to shelve that and for people close to the chosen location to say &ldquo;we do not want to hear about it&rdquo; but there may come a time in the not too distant future when we have to deal with this problem. We are fast approaching the situation where Dublin Airport cannot deal safely with the volume of traffic coming through it: we are talking about 14 million passengers and rising. I do not see how we can keep our economy going, given the number of people employed here and who will be employed in the future as well as those who have businesses at various locations. We will have to examine the options that we can use to back up and enhance Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>By enhancement I do not mean people should decide to hive off the noisiest or most difficult aircraft to one area. That kind of cherry picking is not on, but we need to have regard for the ever-increasing numbers of people who require air transport, sometimes urgently, and who may have to defer travelling due to road traffic en route to the airport or air traffic congestion due to the lack of landing slots. We need to pay more attention to this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of this Bill will be effective and enable people to see that the system works. It has become obvious to me &ndash; perhaps because I am getting older &ndash; that the public expect systems to work. They expect all the institutions we put in place to work efficiently and at every opportunity they come to us, their representatives, to complain about why the system does not work. That should not happen, but it is a fact of life. As a result of changes in legislation or, depending on one's view, an absence or abundance of legislation, people ask: &ldquo;Will X happen? And if not, why not?&rdquo;  I hope this legislation will be of benefit to the consumer, the economy and the country in general. I also hope that the Bill's provisions work and will be seen to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make some points regarding this legislation, some minor and some more substantial. Section 10, with the merit of great directness, gives the Minister the power to give general policy directions to the commission. This is a good departure point because it appears consistent with the analysis of the role of the regulator provided by the former Attorney General, now Commissioner, David Byrne, in one of his seminal addresses to the law society of University College Dublin when he discussed the role of the regulator in Europe and the United States. I hope I give a fair summary of his paper on that occasion when I say that one of its fundamental points was that any Minister in a system such as ours or the British system must give the regulator <Col N="1649" /> a clear envelope of policy directions and that his or her role is within the limits of that set of policy points. That crucial point was made by Mr. Byrne when he addressed the society. I found it to be of immense benefit and my great disappointment is that we have not had an extended debate in either House of the Oireachtas on what is meant by the transfer of ministerial functions to the regulator, be it in telecommunications, transport or, in this case, aviation.</P>
      <P>This is necessary. The context on which Mr. Byrne drew in making those points was that the elected representatives and, in turn, the Minister, who is chosen from among them, must always satisfy a balance between such policies which will serve the citizenry in general. For example, in the areas I mentioned, the right to communicate is a wider citizenship right than the right to sell commodified communication products. As regards transport, for example, the function of regulation would be wrongly and narrowly construed were it to be the construction of an artificial competition at the lucrative end of transport which ignored the citizens' right to access and travel.</P>
      <P>The defining of the role of the regulator in the years following Maastricht has been very confusing. Some European Union countries have construed the role of the regulator as one which is consequent and subsequent to the clear announcement of policy priorities, including State provided services. What I would call the more rabid, neo-liberal, Thatcherite interpretations of the role of the regulator in some cases have suggested that one must almost <i>ab initio</i> remove the hand of the State and then proceed to construe a new space which will be dominated by the market. This has, probably most controversially, created a collision in political terms between member states. An example is broadcasting where it is a distorted, inaccurate and, I believe, illegal construction of broadcasting policy from the directives to suggest that there should not be assistance to the State broadcaster to enable it to fulfil the old Reithian remit of informing, educating and entertaining the mass of the population wider than those who are able to pay for subscribed services.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it would be valuable if the power given to the Minister in section 10 to give general policy directions to the commission did not appear almost subsequent to such practices the commission might define for itself. This is serious. If, as it states in another section of the legislation, it is proposed to establish independence for the commission in an operational sense, that appears to assume that section 10 takes precedence and that the policy direction given to such regulatory authority by the Minister would be antecedent to its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are important points, not just in this legislation but also in terms of legislation governing the role of the regulator. It is consequential to its not being defined that confusion exists as to where accountability lies. For example, some will argue that the transfer of functions in the major <Col N="1650" /> way is akin to the Minister transferring accountability. I do not impute that to this Minister. I simply say that it is an issue which must be resolved.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that we decide what the principles of policy might be. An aviation policy will have to include the policy envelope which might precede the transfer of functions to an independent authority. It must also discuss the manner in which the future of aviation policy is envisaged within a general transport policy which, in turn, takes account of such spatial proposals the Government proposes to make. This raises such questions as to whether one can extend from what one has at present, increasing urban &ldquo;diseconomies&rdquo;, or whether one can reduce the urban &ldquo;diseconomies&rdquo; by establishing a regional spread of aviation services on the periphery of the major user which every speaker has suggested is congested at present and is used to a degree far beyond what was originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to clarify another matter which is local. It is important that the Government announces its strategy regarding future choices and options for regional airports as soon as possible and before this legislation comes into effect. If the commission operates on market principles, some of the best uses of regional airports might never come to be. The Minister was quoted by an Opposition Member as saying that, as regards Galway Airport, for example, she is interested in hearing any plan being submitted and is interested in being supportive of it. However, those administering the airport have made an application for an increased marketing grant to build on what they have and they are left with a certain uncertainty as to whether, if it is proposed to move the airport to another location, the capital funding will be available to assist that. That is a political decision and one which precedes the authority. It is equally a political decision as to where aviation structures are to come into being or to be extended if they are to take account of existing passenger usage and of best ecological practice. They must take account of issues that are wider than the remit of the market.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous to transfer any functions that have been defined in legislation to a commission without announcing the clear policy profile and without defining where the autonomy of the commission will arise. I must express the greatest concern that the functions transferred to the telecommunications regulator are being interpreted in a way that was not thoroughly discussed in the House. That issue arises in that area because of converging technologies and because the boundary of activity is very different now than was originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind the timescale. Market decisions are of necessity governed by the maximum profit in the shortest amount of time with the greatest numbers using the particular service. Proper timescales for the transport policy and, within that, an aviation policy must take <Col N="1651" /> account of other things, for example, the future of the European Union which, especially after the accession of applicant countries, will involve much more inter-regional travel. Therefore, old assumptions, which appear a bit corny at this stage, that the majority of those travelling to another country want to visit the capital city first do not hold up.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present even for the concluding part of my contribution. I repeat my congratulations to Deputy Shatter on taking up his new brief and compliment him again on his record of successfully introducing Private Members' business into the House. I fear for the future of that record, given that the current incumbent in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is less than generous in terms of accepting good ideas from this side of the House. This is despite the fact that the Minister took great personal pride in measures he advocated from this side of the House which were accepted by his predecessor.</P>
      <P>It should be an important part of the reform of the Houses that Ministers should be encouraged to see the Dáil as a real legislative Chamber and not as a cipher or rubber stamp for the work of Departments. It should be perceived as a place for bringing the various talents on all sides of the House to bear on issues so that no side or individual appears to have a monopoly on wisdom.</P>
      <P>I wish to précis some of the arguments I made last night, to deal with some of the aspects of the Bill and make a number of general comments. As already stated, the Bill is a worthy measure and it will be supported by the Labour Party. However, it does not purport to be radical and is limited in its scope. The first point I made to broaden the debate involves the issue of the divided legal profession. I can address that issue as a lay person who is a member of neither the solicitors' nor barristers' profession. I am not convinced that a divided profession, such as the one which currently exists with separate entry, training and disciplinary criteria, best serves the public. When it comes to litigation, I am concerned that the division of the profession adds to the cost to members of the general public of access to legal redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of useful general proposals in the Bill. The first of these &ndash; I am sure Deputy Shatter will be anxious to reply to this point &ndash;<Col N="1652" /> involves having litigation solicitors appointed to the superior courts. As Members are aware, under the law solicitors can be appointed judges of the District and Circuit Courts and can be appointed judges of the High Court from the Circuit Court. This provision, should it be enacted, would allow solicitors who are designated litigation solicitors to be appointed to the superior courts immediately.</P>
    <P>I raised a number of points last night regarding how litigation solicitors could be identified and Deputy Shatter pointed out to me that in the definition section he has defined that term. The Bill states that High Court or Supreme Court litigation solicitor means a practising solicitor who is regularly engaged in the conduct of proceedings before the High Court or the Supreme Court whether as an advocate or as an instructing solicitor to counsel. I have a difficulty with that definition &ndash; I was aware of it when I made my comments last night &ndash; because, being involved as an instructing solicitor, it is hard to judge the person's involvement in litigation in that sense.</P>
    <P>I was probably disingenuous when I stated that many solicitors have a hard neck charging fees for what amounts largely to clerical work in certain instances in circumstances where they hire an advocate to prosecute or take a case and sit in the court with no great function other than to instruct counsel in the matter. I am sure that extensive briefs are prepared by some but it would be difficult to ascertain from the definition, solicitors who would measure up to the criteria we would expect of people serving in the good tradition of eminent High Court and Supreme Court judges.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell overlong on this matter but I made the point last night that the definition to which I refer requires some refinement. For example, what does the term &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; mean when used in this instance? Does it mean once a year or several times a year? These issues can be teased out later and, as already stated, this point is extraneous to the principle which I strongly support.</P>
    <P>The current system of appointment introduced in recent legislation to establish a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board came about on foot of concern within the body politic and the among members of the general public in relation to appointments to the Judiciary. I recall when my party was in Government with Fianna Fáil some difficulties arose in respect of the appointment of the President of the High Court. I was asked to sit down with a Cabinet Minister from Fianna Fáil to devise a system and the embryonic judicial advisory board system emerged from those discussions. However, legislation was not enacted until the following Administration came to power.</P>
    <P>I stated last night that I have some concerns, in principle, about the workings of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. I welcome the Minister's comments that he also would require more openness in the way that system works. I wish to refer to two aspects which need to be addressed. First, the broadness of the recom<Col N="1653" /> mendations that come to Cabinet. As stated last night, seven are required to be present but those applications that are not successful remain on the table unless the applicants wish to have their names withdrawn. Therefore, the actual pool from which the Government chooses can be a number far greater than seven at any given time. I would prefer it if a smaller select list were presented.</P>
    <P>I have a number of difficulties with regard to the consultative process or, to use the term employed in the Law Library, the &ldquo;soundings&rdquo; which are taken in private to determine whose names should be placed on the list. I am fully aware that we cannot have a public list because people would not put themselves forward if they thought their candidature might be made public and that, in the event they were not chosen, it might have an effect on their standing thereafter. However, we require a more open system than the &ldquo;soundings&rdquo; that are currently taken.</P>
    <P>On the general accountability of judges, a matter on which the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, has made comment upon in recent times, the Bill deals with appointment only but we need to deal also with some measure of accountability after appointment. I know that a report on that matter is to become available shortly and I hope this matter is one of high priority for the Minister.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to solicitors being appointed senior counsel. As stated briefly last night, I am assured that the procedure for the appointment of senior counsels is one which simply creates precedence within the Bar, has no other status and is a throwback to the sovereign's prerogative from a foreign jurisdiction. I understand there is no legal basis for this procedure and I am advised that there have been no legally created senior counsels in this State since its foundation. The Minister might be willing to address this matter or perhaps not.</P>
    <P>In essence, I have no difficulty in supporting the measures proposed in the Bill. The Minister, in the spirit of accepting reasonable ideas from this side of the House and allowing them to progress to Committee Stage, should also accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Conor Lenihan, John McGuinness, Pat Carey, Brendan Kenneally, Marian McGennis and Michael Kitt.</P>
      <P>Again we debate an issue which the Opposition has seized upon in an attempt to embarrass the Government. In trying to steal a march on the Minister they have jumped the gun because they know the Government's Court and Court Officers Bill is about to be published. That Bill will be comprehensive and will include many recommendations from the expert groups which have been deliberating since 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Private Members' Bill is to give effect to the main recommendations of the report of the working group on qualifications for appointment of judges of the High Court and Supreme Court which was published <Col N="1654" /> on 16 February 1999. The group was established on 10 December 1996 by the then Minister for Justice to consider and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice on the question of qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. The Minister advised us last evening on the new Government Bill and said the Court and Court Officers Bill, 2000, is due to be published this session. The drafting of the Bill is close to finalisation but since Government approval to publish has yet to be sought it is not possible to disclose its contents in any degree of detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that during the course of the drafting process careful consideration was given to each of the report's recommendations and to the implications which would flow from their implementation. That consideration indicated that there were certain difficulties with aspects of the recommendations. The principle contained both in the report and in the Private Members' Bill, that solicitors with appropriate practice and experience should be eligible for appointment to the High and Supreme Courts, has been accepted by the Government and will be reflected in the forthcoming Bill but the mechanism whereby that principle is to be realised may differ somewhat from that envisaged by the report.</P>
    <P>The Government Bill will also deal with a range of other court related matters, mainly administrative in nature. Its scope will be wider than that of the Bill now before the House. It is interesting to note that a section from the fourth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution dealing with the appointment of judges discusses the role of the judicial appointments advisory board. The committee expresses the view that the present system of appointing judges should be retained. This was an all-party committee proposal. Why has Fine Gael departed from that all-party view?</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill would require the Government, prior to advising the President on the appointment of a person to judicial office, to submit the name of that person to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to take into account the views of that committee. That would be a radical change in existing procedure. It is unclear how it would work in practice and, in any event, would necessitate widespread consultation before being implemented. The Minister strongly favours working within the present structures with a view to improving them as far as possible. I agree with him in this.</P>
    <P>There should be a reference to the judicial committee which was established in April 1999, as recommended in the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission. Its remit was to consider the sixth report of the working group; consider further the position in other jurisdictions including Canada, New South Wales, the United States and New Zealand; consult the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Bar Council, the Law Society, academics and others and <Col N="1655" /> receive other submissions from interested bodies; advise and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct, establish a system for the handling of complaints of judicial conduct and other activities such as are undertaken by other similar bodies; do other preparatory work including that relating to judicial standards and ethics; and consider other matters which had arisen since the sixth report was finalised in the previous November. The establishment of the commission was warmly welcomed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is hoped the report will be available by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I call on the Opposition to withdraw the Bill and await the Minister's Bill which will be published shortly. This will be a comprehensive Bill which can be debated on all Stages before being passed by the House.</P>

      <P>I do not want to draw further on the ire of Deputy Ring or excite him further, so I will just say that this Fine Gael Bill would perhaps have been better left to one side and the Government bring forward its own Bill. Time <Col N="1657" /> would have been better spent on Second Stage and on Committee Stages, deliberating on the contents of the Minister's Bill, rather than on this Bill. Perhaps this Bill was prompted more by the issue of judicial appointments than by the need to introduce proper legislation and as a result, it is lacking somewhat in content.</P>
      <P>I welcome the indication by the Minister last night that the pool from which judicial appointments will be drawn in the future may be widened and will include solicitors, for certain courts at least. However, the appointment of judges should continue in its present format and should be part and parcel of the activities of the Cabinet. Referring these appointments to committees is not the way to go. The Government is elected and the Cabinet is appointed and should deal with all of these issues. Successive Governments in the main have made excellent appointments to all courts and the judicial process has been blessed with quality candidates for such appointments. It is important to emphasise that judges have served the system well and that the debate on this Bill does not take away from that record or create doubt or uncertainty about the system.</P>
      <P>Recent changes in the Courts Service's department and the appointment of its own chief executive officer has brought about very positive changes in our court system and administration. Facilities too have improved, not only for the judges and the legal profession but for the general public. An extensive courthouse refurbishment programme has also been implemented. That too has improved the working conditions for people, the manner in which the courts are held and has been an asset for the general public because they have seen at first hand the excellent service available. I have no doubt that the Government's Court and Court Officers Bill, will deal extensively with not just the appointments but also with other administrative issues that are part and parcel of the judicial system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will introduce a Bill. Given his record in this House, I have no doubt he will put before us a Bill with vision and content, to which I look forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely debate. I do not suggest that Deputy Shatter is doing anything other than facilitating such a debate. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, said last night in the course of his contribution, it should be remembered that Governments of all parties since the foundation of the State have had a role in shaping the judicial appointments system, which we have <Col N="1658" /> now. If there are to be changes in that system, they should be introduced on the basis of consensus and by general agreement.</P>
      <P>An independent judiciary is a very precious commodity. We have been lucky to date in the calibre of those appointed to serve as judges and as the all-party committee has noted, there is no evidence that those appointed in the past have displayed favouritism to the party that appointed them. Any such suggestion would be extremely insulting. If there are changes to the appointments process, we must be sure those changes are worthwhile and that a demonstrable value is to be gained in making them.</P>
      <P>In the course of his interview with the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo;  programme some weeks ago, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, said that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, of which he is chairman, recommends up to seven names to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a judicial post. They are appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government. The Government has the say. If they are to progress with a different mechanism, that did not involve the Government at all, that would require a constitutional amendment. We ought to tread warily.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of good content in Deputy Shatter's Bill but there is much that needs to be teased out and as has been said elsewhere, the devil is certainly in the detail. It would be far better if we were to leave the Bill to one side and concentrate on the Minister's Bill which he has suggested will be part of forthcoming legislation shortly. We already have a mechanism in this State with specialist expertise in the law, through which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is available to assess and vet applicants for judicial office. The 1995 Act sets forth criteria for the assessment of candidates. All elements of the legal profession, the judiciary, solicitors, barristers and the State through the Attorney General, are represented on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>A point that must be raised on the committee anticipated in the Private Members' Bill, is that there is no reason to single out judicial appointments for this procedure. There are many other public offices which would require similar treatment. For example, would we do it for Ministers or Ministers of State, directors and chief executive officers of State boards and EU Commissioners? It is not clear what the remit of the proposed committee in the Private Members' Bill is supposed to be. It does not deal either with any interaction with the role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. For example, is it to test the political and social outlook of the nominee? If so, this could be damaging to the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>There is a need, in the light of recent experience, to examine some way of addressing the ethics of the judiciary but that is probably for another day and we can address it when the Minister introduces his Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know just why the Opposition has tabled this Bill at this time. It is accepted practice and only logical, that Private Members' time should be used for measures other than those the Government proposes. As much of what is proposed in the Courts Bill, 2000, will be tabled under the Government's Court and Court Officers Bill, 2000, which will probably be introduced later in this session, it seems rather a waste of time and Opposition resources to debate this measure this evening.</P>
      <P>I can only conclude that Fine Gael feels this is the area in which the Government is most deficient and can find very little else about which to criticise it. However, since it was tabled, we should point out some of its deficiencies and the reasons the party opposite should wait for the more complete Government measure.</P>
      <P>While I agree that certain changes are both desirable and necessary in the appointment of judges, it would be only fair to point out that the system as operated up to now has worked very well. Had it not, we would have been embroiled in far more controversy, had many more debates and have heard many more calls for impeachment. It is a tribute to the way judges in general have conducted themselves and have kept largely out of the public eye, that we have not needed to debate their behaviour in this House to any significant extent.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, introduced the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to recommend suitable candidates to the Minister. This has lessened the use of political patronage and has brought a greater measure of transparency to the appointment process. It is a tribute to the members of the Judiciary that they have largely acted fairly in whatever matters have come before them, regardless of which Government appointed them or how their deliberations affected the Government of the day. In short, we have been generally well served by previous appointees.</P>
      <P>However, nothing stands still. We are in rapidly changing times, with changing standards and a vastly different society to that of even ten years ago. We must move with the times, react to change and be ahead of it, if at all possible.</P>
      <P>The proposal whereby solicitors with the appropriate practice and experience could be appointed as judges of the High and Supreme Courts, appointments denied to them under the present system, is a logical one. This will be provided for in the Government Bill and is a measure which is long overdue. No doubt there will be some reservations expressed in some branches of the legal profession, but that should not be sufficient reason for not going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Opposition is well aware, this was provided for in the report of the working group and is just one of the several proposals made in this Bill which are known either to find favour with the Government or are already included in its measure. I very much favour the proposal whereby all proposed appointees to the bench <Col N="1660" /> must be able to produce a tax clearance certificate under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This is logical from two points of view. First, we already demand such a certificate from other professions and, second, it will establish that judges are required to be at least as transparent in their financial and tax dealings as any other member of the public. I am not in the least suggesting that judges are any more likely not to have their affairs in order than anyone else, but in this day and age, while judges must remain aloof, they must be as amenable to the law as any other citizen. We have seen recently how events can reach out to even the Judiciary and embroil them in controversy in circumstances which would not have been contemplated even a few short years ago.</P>
    <P>I realise that it must be very difficult for the Opposition to come up with proposals which are not already in place or will not be included in the Government's forthcoming measure. However, there is one proposal which I can only describe as daft, namely, the suggestion that the names of appointees be put before a committee of the House for ratification prior to recommending them to the President for appointment. Considering the Government of the day would make the recommendation to the committee and that the Government side would have an automatic majority on the committee, the process would be little more than window dressing and rubber stamping.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while the Bill has certain elements to recommend it, I would on balance prefer to wait for the Government measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the work which has gone into the preparation of the Bill. It is always difficult to bring forward a Private Members' Bill and Deputy Shatter has a very good track record in that respect. I also wish to recognise that the Bill which the Minister referred to will be far more wide ranging that the Bill before us. The matters which the Minister proposes to deal with are not in the Bill. As the Minister said, he is not in a position to give us the exact detail of the Bill until it is approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals principally with eligibility for appointment as judges, which I recognise is important, but from the point of view of court practitioners and those who use the courts, there is a far more urgent need to overhaul the way the courts do their business.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the committee on court practices and procedures which recently discussed such issues, and I wish to refer to a submission which I received from a solicitor. I would like to ask the Minister to look at the issues which were raised by way of submission to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill refers to the need to abolish the requirement for personal attendance in the High Court and Central Criminal Court and the Minister stated that will be included in his Bill. The solicitor who made the <Col N="1661" /> submission to us has also requested that we recommend a change in the rules of the superior courts to permit the delivery of documents by fax. It is amazing that in the 21st century there is still a requirement to bring documents in person given that the country is designated an e-commerce hub. We have also been asked to consider changing the rules of the superior courts to permit the delivery of documents by e-mail, and it is amazing this is not currently available. Another recommendation was that probate applications be permitted to be made by post. There are lengthy queues for various reasons in the Four Courts which is obviously a waste of time for the people who have to queue and of the time and resources of those working in the courts.</P>
    <P>It was also recommended that the courts join the document exchange &ndash; the submission we received suggested this would vastly improve the manner in which work is done in the courts; that we make all court forms available on computer disc in the usual word processor formats, for example, Word, WordPerfect and Lotus &ndash; I know the Revenue Commissioners are about to do this and I see no reason the courts cannot do likewise; and the need to simplify probate forms, which is a matter of language. The submission points out that the language is archaic and anyone who has used the forms will agree. A recommendation was also made to abolish any requirement to obtaining a return date for motions before the court and court masters. I specifically mention these points because the Minister has indicated that his Bill will be far more wide ranging than that before us. Also, solicitors should be permitted to run accounts for court fees. Currently there is a need to physically present oneself and pay to have a document stamped which seems absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the way the business of courts is conducted in terms of families who have to appear. I wish to put on record my appreciation of the way in which the garda liaison officer helps families who have to attend court for such things as murder and manslaughter cases. The physical lay-out of courts can be very traumatic and upsetting for families and I think the Minister in conjunction with the courts' body should look at a major refurbishment of our courts. We need to go about our court business in a much better way. This Bill achieves some of that, but I hope the Minister's Bill will go much further.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing forward the legislation. He has certainly opened debate on the issue of judicial appointments. I am also glad the Minister has referred to the Government Bill which will be introduced in this session. What is contained in Deputy Shatter's Bill and in the Minister's Bill will open up opportunities for solicitors with appropriate practice and experience to be eligible for appointment to the higher and superior courts. As my col- lea<Col N="1662" /> gues said, it widens the pool for such appointments.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have made excellent appointments in the past. One of the criticisms has been that Governments have appointed their own supporters. It is true to say that Jack Lynch, as Taoiseach, and from then on successive Taoisigh, reversed that trend and appointed people from different political persuasions.</P>
      <P>We have had debates about extending the remit of judges. We had an example in the past of a judge who had the incorrect date of birth recorded and legislation had to be introduced to rectify the matter. What is being proposed by Deputy Shatter regarding solicitors, which has been accepted by the Minister, is logical. The Minister said the Government Bill will also deal with a range of other court related matters, mainly administrative in nature.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Significantly, the all-party committee expressed the view that the current system of appointing judges should be retained. There is a suggestion in the Private Members' Bill that the name of the person to be appointed should be submitted to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not too clear how that would work in practice, and in any event it would need widespread consultation before being implemented. Obviously, questions arise about the need for the attendance of the individual concerned, or whether the person would be questioned by a committee. The Minister favours working with the current structure, something with which I agree. We should improve the current system if at all possible, but we have an independent Judiciary which is enshrined in our Constitution and we must be careful that we do not encroach upon the independence and tradition which exist.</P>
      <P>Our Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is composed of eminent individuals of the highest integrity and all persons nominated for judicial appointments since the Government took office have been drawn from lists submitted by the board. The advisory board must satisfy itself that the person concerned has met certain criteria set out in the Act which ensures that individuals with appropriate competence are recommended for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the balance of rights between the confidentiality which individual applicants have a right to expect and the requirements of accountability and I hope the Minister will have that transparency in the Bill which he will publish. These structures have only been in place since 1995 and I am sure they can be improved, but we have to move with care and it requires debate and consultation among the legal profession, the Judiciary and the Courts Service. I am sure the Judiciary would like changes. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has expressed its view that the Government cannot be open to the criticism that it only appoints its <Col N="1663" /> own supporters rather than suitably qualified persons when choosing from the list. That is a very important statement and I welcome the fact that the Minister is in favour of introducing legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the widening of the eligibility of solicitors for appointment to the superior courts. I hope the Government will introduce legislation in the near future to deal with this issue and other court related matters.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter for introducing this Private Members' Bill which represents his 18th Private Members' motion. That is why I became upset on hearing Deputy Lenihan, a man who has never introduced legislation in the House and the way he is shaping up, he probably never will. Four of Deputy Shatter's motions have been accepted by the Government and have been incorporated into Government Bills.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when in Opposition, was a good man for introducing Private Members' motions, many of which were accepted by the Government of the day. I urge him to accept Deputy Shatter's motion and to address any problems which may exist on Committee Stage. This is very good legislation which should be immediately taken on board by the Government. Some 18 months ago, the Government promised to introduce its own legislation on this matter. We will have a new Government in another 18 months' time. The Law Society has welcomed this legislation. In a press release dated 10 October it stated that if the Government did not intend to introduce its own legislation in this area, it should accept this legislation and rectify any deficiencies on Committee Stage. That is a very reasonable request.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is very lucky to have a person of Deputy Shatter's calibre who can introduce this type of legislation. The Government has numerous officials and advisers at its disposal, yet Deputy Shatter, a lonely backbencher, can introduce this necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate and compliment Deputy Shatter. I was upset to hear Deputy Lenihan castigating him tonight. We are proud to have Deputy Shatter in our party. When he becomes a Minister he will generate such a vol<Col N="1664" /> ume of legislation that the Opposition will not know what has hit it. I encourage Deputy Shatter to keep up the good work and hope Fianna Fáil can find somebody of his calibre in its ranks.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the legislation would enable solicitors to become High Court judges. Many ordinary people, who do not understand the legal process, are amazed to find that judges can be interfered with and that politicians can go into judge's homes drinking tea in an effort to rectify legal situations. Ordinary people were of the opinion that nobody could interfere with the judicial process. Like politics, the Church and education, the judicial process has been badly damaged over the past 12 months and many people have lost confidence in it. That is understandable when people see former Ministers making representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to judicial appointments. I could understand Deputy Lenihan, a man without any legal experience who has never served as a Minister and who would not understand how the process works, doing that. He stated that all his representations were very successful. It is amazing to learn that he has such power within the Government; I thought the Independents held all the power.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful to see the judicial process being interfered with. I compliment Deputy Shatter on his good work; we need more people like him in this House because they will restore the confidence in the system which people are demanding. I look forward to seeing his 19th piece of legislation being introduced in the coming weeks and I hope the Minister will accept this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this Bill and to compliment Deputy Shatter on its introduction. I regret that the Minister and the Government see fit to reject the Bill, the timing of which is very appropriate in the aftermath of a series of very serious difficulties involving members of the Judiciary. It is of paramount importance that the separation of powers between the Judiciary and Executive is placed beyond doubt at all times. The recent Sheedy affair and its far reaching repercussions highlighted the essential need for this divide to be clearly maintained at all times, as required by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established under the Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, for the alleged purpose of introducing openness and accountability in the area of judicial appointments. In spite of this, the Minister retains the right to override the board's recommendations and to revert to the old system of appointing the Minister's own personal choice. The statistics outlined by Deputy Shatter on representations made by Government Members in regard to judicial appointments show that the <Col N="1665" /> present system leaves a lot to be desired in terms of openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister criticised Deputy Shatter's proposal that the name of the Government's nominee be submitted to an Oireachtas committee on the grounds that this would interfere with the Judiciary's independence. On the contrary, what better means could be devised to ensure the openness of judicial appointments? Furthermore, there is a series of inconsistencies in the Minister's views on this Bill. In his speech he stated that the approach taken in the working group's report was perhaps unnecessarily rigid and that something less formulaic might work better in practice. Further on in his speech he criticised this Bill on the basis that it is a mere skeleton of a proposal in which there is such an insufficiency of detail that to accept it would be impermissible folly. It is regrettable that the Minister feels the need to clutch at straws in order to justify rejecting Deputy Shatter's Bill, a Bill which he acknowledged at the outset was very worthwhile and commendable. There were numerous inconsistencies in the Minister's speech indicating the uncertainty of his own position on the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Shatter's proposal to free up appointments to the Office of the Attorney General by providing for the acceptance of solicitors, not only to the staff of the office but also to the position of Attorney General itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill would widen the pool of lawyers from which judicial appointments could be made by permitting the direct appointment to the High Court and Supreme Court of solicitors who have ten years' experience in litigation. As it stands, only barristers who have been in practice for 12 years' can be appointed. The Bill would reduce that to ten years. There are only 1,300 barristers in the country while there are 5,500 solicitors. It is obvious that this Bill would provide increased opportunities for people of differing abilities from different backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's record of producing legislation, unlike that of Deputy Lenihan, is second to none. The independence of the Judiciary is a core value of our democracy. However, justice delayed is justice denied. Young people who are prepared to report rape and other abuses must wait five or six years to have their cases heard because of delays in the court system. We would welcome it if under this legislation more and better judges were appointed. Many of those who are waiting for justice to be done will also welcome Deputy Shatter's efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of judges must be more open and transparent and not done solely on political record. The list system must be more transparent. The fact that the Minister has admitted to receiving over 40 representations from Oireachtas colleagues in respect of judicial appointments indi<Col N="1666" /> cates how the system works. It was interesting to hear Deputy Lenihan say he was fortunate to have one of his nominees appointed; I hope his ability is not similar.</P>
    <P>Judges must be accountable. There is need for an appraisal of those in the system. Unless there is more even handed treatment in the courts serious doubt will be cast over judgments. There was a recent case where a person from outside the State was caught speeding at 100 m.p.h. through a housing estate. Following a plea by the legal personnel the judge found that payment of £100 into the poor box was sufficient penalty. This sends out a message that cannot be justified. In another case a person taking diesel oil across the Border was let off on a technicality because the judge found we, as legislators, did not have a proper system in place.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill a retired judge cannot be appointed to any domestic or international body without the approval of the appropriate Oireachtas committee. If such a provision had been in force last June the Government would not have been able to appoint Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank without first submitting his name to the committee for approval. Everyone in this House would have been better off had that appointment not taken place. It opened up many wounds and left many question marks over the judicial system that will take a long time to die down.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes there should be greater Government accountability and proper parliamentary scrutiny in regard to judicial appointments. The Bill requires that prior to the Government formally advising the President of the name of its nominee to judicial office it must submit the name to an appropriate committee of the House. That is a positive step that should be implemented.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Bill and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on introducing this legislation. As previous speakers have said, he is well regarded for bringing worthwhile legislation before us. The Government should deal with it in a more pragmatic manner than the Minister who disregarded many of the proposals.</P>
      <P>I studied law but did not practise it. The public is far removed from what occurs and this Bill would make it more transparent. The catch-cry of politicians is that the public must understand whatever legislation is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposal that allows solicitors to become High Court and Supreme Court judges. It is imperative that appointments are not confined to the Bar because only a small number of people are involved. It is important that solicitors be considered for these worthwhile positions. I have no doubt but that when the Government brings in legislation it will accept this principle. <Col N="1667" /> There is no openness or transparency in the current system. The Bill requires that the names of the Government nominees be submitted to the appropriate Oireachtas committee, which is the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, so that it may consider the nomination and express an opinion on it which will be published and submitted to the Government. The committee will be enabled to hold a hearing on the appointments where it is deemed appropriate and, for the first time, the Oireachtas will have a role in the making of judicial appointments. That is fundamental to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of the last ten judges appointed by the Government, eight were appointed because of strong representations made by members of the Government parties. We must move away from the position where politics is seen to play a role in judicial appointments. The only way to do that is to submit a list of those proposed under the 1995 Act to the committee so that it can question them. In that way the public would know there is openness and transparency in the system. I do not understand how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can refuse that. It can only be of benefit to those who are appointed.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are at the coalface meeting clients. Many people will have dealings with a solicitor at some stage but few meet barristers unless they go to the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court. Litigants who attend those courts are often in awe of the outdated procedures that exist. Deputy Shatter stated in the Bill that the wearing of wigs should be done away with. We are dealing with people in the 21st century, not the 1800s.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that no retired judge can be appointed to any domestic or international body without the approval of an Oireachtas committee. As a number of my colleagues have said, the debacle concerning the former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, would not have occurred had this Bill been in place. The proposal that solicitors should be considered for appointment as Attorney General would give the Government a wider pool from which to appoint someone rather than confining it to a member of the Bar. The Bill will make for excellent legislation. For the life of me I cannot understand why the Government will not agree to take on board most of its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on bringing forward this important legislation. The separation of powers is regarded as being one of the cornerstones of democracy. The Judiciary should be entirely independent from the other limbs of government, the Executive and the Legislature. The system under which judges are appointed by reference to their political affiliations is harmful to this concept and, therefore, undesirable. This becomes apparent when one <Col N="1668" /> considers that it is the party in government which dictates who is to be appointed.</P>
      <P>The system of politically appointed judges is contrary to the rule of law, which is fundamental to all systems of constitutional law and defined as the separation of the official's moral or political preference from the rules he or she is supposed to administer. The key concept is objectivity. It is a constitutional principle that all citizens are equal before the law. Clearly, there is a tacit, if not overt, pressure on a judge to regard in a benign fashion provisions advocated by a particular party.</P>
      <P>There is a system of checks and balances in the Constitution, under Article 26 of which Supreme Court judges are frequently called upon to assess the constitutionality of Bills referred to the Supreme Court by the President. It is obvious that if a particular Bill has been proposed by a certain party, political appointees of the same creed on the bench will consciously or unconsciously consider the proposal in a certain light.</P>
      <P>The Judicial Advisory Committee merely advises the Government on who should be appointed as judges. The scope for abuse is obvious. Time and again our best legal minds have been passed over because of their political hue. In short, there is no guarantee that the best man or woman will always get the job. The system smacks of cronyism and jobs for the boys.</P>
      <P>In a democracy justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. Questions raised about the Sheedy affair remain unanswered. It exposed what Patrick Kavanagh called the half-talk code of mystery, the wink and the elbow language. This nod and wink culture has no place in 21st century Ireland. The ethos is openness. At a time when we have a Freedom of Information Act dating from 1997 and tribunals of inquiry probing into the dark recesses of public life, to maintain the current system is to fly in the face of the spirit of glasnost now prevailing. In a democratic society one must strive to ensure openness and impartiality in the selection and appointment of judges. That is not to say that judges should be devoid of opinions. On the contrary, the more experience a judge has the better. As a great American jurist noted, the life of the law has been experience, not logic. Political patronage is tipping the scales too far on the side of subjectivity. It is both archaic and outdated.</P>
      <P>This Bill would widen the pool of lawyers from which judicial appointments may be made by permitting the direct appointment of solicitors in practise as judges in the High Court and Supreme Court. Given that there is a closed shop, this is an important recommendation. The broad experience solicitors would bring to the bench would be of benefit in administering the law fairly. That is what the people expect. Whether one is a millionaire or on minimum income, everyone is equal before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> The Bill is very much in keeping with the 21st century. It would provide for the independence of judicial appointments regardless of political patronage. I compliment Deputy Shatter on bringing forward this important legislation which would have far-reaching implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in acknowledging the excellent work done by Deputy Shatter in bringing forward this legislation and giving us the opportunity to discuss the matters contained therein. I wish to raise a point that has not been raised so far in the debate. Unlike others, I would have no difficulty in appearing before a judge known to have a Fianna Fáil background. By and large, members of the Judiciary behave in an independent manner regardless of their political affiliations. They do try to be fair and that fairness shines through. This is something of which we should be aware and appreciate and we should be careful not to deny or denigrate it. That is not to say, however, that all judges are as good as others. Given their number, there are some who do not measure up to the job. One of the difficulties is that there is no way of bucking them up &ndash; one either removes them from the bench or leaves them where they are.</P>
      <P>How representative are members of the Judiciary? As they are unelected, they cannot be representative in the way Members of the Dáil are, but one presumes that those who sit in judgment on the community have first-hand knowledge or if they do not, that they will seek to acquire it to enable them to do the job they are supposed to do. I very much doubt, however, that people in parts of my constituency such as Cherry Orchard, Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens have ever met a judge. Some would say that judges simply do not understand the difficulties that they face which in many instances are directly related to law and order.</P>
      <P>Judges do not apply the laws that we pass because of our understanding of the difficulties people face. For example, there is a fine new estate in my constituency. Most of the people living there are excellent but life is being made hell for them by a handful of others. It is almost impossible to deal with this situation. In the recent past we have passed the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, both of which need to be implemented. I understand that for the first time a judge is considering applying an interim exclusion order to prohibit youths from gathering in a part of my constituency in which they do not live. I am glad about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those nominated for appointment as judges had to appear before a committee of the House, I at least would be able to ask them what they know about Cherry Orchard and Fatima Mansions, when they were last in Dolphin House or <Col N="1670" /> St. Teresa's Gardens and when appointed to the bench if they would make it their business to meet the communities concerned to ascertain what life is like outside of Dublin 4 and similar areas. As representatives of those areas we must experience their problems first-hand. It is not good enough that judges are far removed from them. If they are to do their job properly, they should acquaint themselves with the conditions and environment in which communities live. A total of 98% or 99% of the people living in each of the areas mentioned are decent, law-abiding and upright citizens who are of the view that they have been let down by the State. All they are seeking is law and order in their communities. When they want to confront the State they can arrange to meet their public representatives, the local Garda superintendent and officials of Dublin Corporation, but they never get to meet a judge.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the presidents of the various courts and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide induction training courses for judges following their appointment. I also appeal to the Minister to accept the provision under which judges would have to appear before a committee of the House prior to their appointment. This would enable me and others like me to put these questions to them.</P>
    <P>The Bill would make provision for the appointment of solicitors as judges, in the same way as barristers, in the higher courts. I advocated this when I introduced a Private Members' Bill in 1987, the Reform of the Courts Administration Bill, much of which has come to pass with the enactment of the Court and Court Officers Act.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to be a judge to sit in the District Court? Does it not require common sense rather than a grasp of the finer points of the law, especially if there is an experienced advocate or defendant of a case, or the registrar of the court, to advise the judge on the law? Do we need lawyers to man the lower courts?</P>
    <P>There is very little chance that anybody from the areas I have mentioned will ever qualify as a lawyer. However, from the people I know in those areas, a large number would qualify to be good judges. I wish we could find a way to put people on the benches of the lower courts who are not necessarily qualified as lawyers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>As might have been expected, the debate on the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter has been very interesting. It has given rise to some thought provoking ideas, including the rather novel idea of moving towards what is termed the legal equivalent of the chain store. I imagine this concept might get a unified response from both sides of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier, the core principle <Col N="1671" /> at the centre of this Bill, that solicitors of appropriate qualification and experience be eligible for appointment to the superior courts, is acceptable to the Government. However, it is crucial that the system put in place to effect this change is one we can stand over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin in his intervention pointed to certain weaknesses inherent in the Bill. This demonstrates that the approach taken is not without controversy. It also underlines the fact that devising a workable method for the possible appointment of suitable solicitor judges to the superior courts is not as simple as it might at first seem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter argued in favour of greater governmental accountability for the making of judicial appointments and for the proper parliamentary scrutiny of that process. However, he also acknowledged that these matters are governed by constitutional constraints. The Minister is open to working structures and to improving them in so far as this is feasible, but the independence of the Judiciary cannot be compromised and there must be serious misgivings about the desirability or workability of the committee type system proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins dealt at length with the procedures that exist for dealing with complaints regarding misconduct by judges. Recommendations touch on this point in the fourth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which recommends the establishment under the Constitution of a judicial council. That body's function would be to review judicial conduct as distinct from judicial decisions and to draw up a code of ethics. The committee also recommended the introduction of impeachment procedures for judges similar to those which apply to the President.</P>
    <P>The judicial committee established following the publication last year of the sixth working group on a courts' commission is also examining the question of judicial conduct. The committee has looked at the position in other jurisdictions, including Canada, New South Wales, the USA and New Zealand. It has also initiated consultations and has received submissions from interested bodies.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in accordance with its terms of reference, it will advise on, and prepare the way for, the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints relating to such conduct. It will also do other preparatory work relating to judicial standards and ethics and will consider matters which have arisen since the sixth report was finalised in November 1998. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government should await the report of that committee before coming to any firm conclusions on these issues.</P>
    <P>No debate on the system of appointing judges <Col N="1672" /> should take place in isolation from some consideration being given to the supports for judges once they take up office. In this context the Government is committed to introducing reforming measures through the justice system and statute law. Indeed, it is almost one year since the Courts Service was formally established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This was the most fundamental reform of the courts system since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the day to day management of our courts now lies with the Courts Service under the stewardship of the board and the chief executive officer. A programme of change and modernisation is under way. Increased resources were also provided this year, including £7 million for information technology and £13.5 million for construction, refurbishment and upgrading of the courts.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing reform and modernisation of the courts system. This debate has been useful in highlighting some very important issues. We will no doubt have an opportunity to encounter them again when the Courts and Courts Officers Bill is published later in the session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a privilege and a pleasure to sit with Deputy Shatter, as we have done over the many years we have been Members of this House. Deputy Shatter has made a huge contribution to the body of legislation introduced to the House. He has acted in the role of legislator, the most important role of elected representatives and one which carries with it a huge responsibility. It is only through the introduction and implementation of legislation that we can guarantee democracy, equality and protection of citizens' rights.</P>
      <P>As he has done when addressing all legislation introduced to the House, Deputy Shatter centrally addresses in this Bill the issue of making the law and the practise and accessibility of the law more open, equal and operable. That is why this Bill is of such importance.</P>
      <P>When we look at the procedures of this House and of the courts it is sometimes hard to believe that we are in a new millennium because for a long time we have operated as if in the 19th century. This built up a sense of isolation, elitism and removal from reality in the perception of people with regard to the workings of the courts and their trust and confidence in them. This is what the Bill seeks to address. Its implementation is urgent.</P>
      <P>To ensure the Bill becomes the working document it should be we need more modern and well equipped courts. Deputy Shatter addressed that. Above all, we need more resources, staff and more free civil legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central thrust of the Bill is to widen the <Col N="1673" /> pool of lawyers and their expertise and experience. As Deputy Gerry Reynolds said, solicitors are at the coal face. This is something we are reminded of in the role of Deputy Shatter, both as lawyer and legislator. They are not outside the community, nor the experience of people, the majority of whom, unfortunately, are desperate when they are called to court.</P>
    <P>The public demands the openness and transparency sought by the Bill. One of the greatest things we must do in this democracy is to restore confidence in Parliament, including the way legislation is introduced and implemented. It is also necessary to restore confidence in the Judiciary and in the way it will judge and operate the legislation. Both institutions have been badly damaged and highly distrusted because of recent events. It is our responsibility and that of the Judiciary to restore confidence with all urgency. That is why I am disappointed the Bill is not being accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally's contribution confirmed something I and the other members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights found out to our cost and frustration when we attempted to deal with the Sheedy affair. There is no way, either through the Constitution or the mandate given to Members of this House, to investigate people or bring them before committees to explain or answer what the citizens wish to have answered. Part of the Bill Deputy Shatter has included would allow a person to appear before a committee, such as the committee I have just described. However, Deputy Kenneally said that would be a rubber stamp. That is a matter of concern because it seems the Government believes the Oireachtas committees, which have all-party representation and expertise, are a rubber stamp. As someone who believes in and has worked the committee system and who wants to strengthen it, I reject that. It is an indictment of the Government that Deputy Kenneally views the committees, particularly the committee of which I am the vice-chairman, as a rubber stamp for Government. I would like the Minister to reject that as soon as possible. There is no point in having Oireachtas all-party committees and hoping they work in an open, transparent and democratic way. I would like the Minister to restore confidence in that process and to ensure it is accepted.</P>
    <P>Our court system may have been put in place with the best of intentions. However, I am sure Deputy Shatter knows more than most that <i>in camera</i> family law cases and decisions made behind closed doors must be brought out into the open. I hope we have an opportunity in the near future to debate this issue more fully. I also hope we introduce other promised legislation and that solicitors working in the system and couples, families and children who appear before the courts <Col N="1674" /> receive public acknowledgement that justice is working for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate on this important measure. I thank all my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party for their kind words and vigorous support for this important reforming legislation. I also thank the Labour Party for its support.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed at the attitude taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This measure was brought forward because there is a need to introduce substantial reform in our court system. There is a need to blow the cobwebs out of the legal profession. The Minister in his speech could not advance a single substantive reason for the Government's opposition to the Bill. The main reason is that he has been thinking about introducing a Bill for 18 months and he wants to go on thinking about it because all these issues are complex and difficult. Perhaps he will eventually get around to doing it.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is supposed to be a legislative assembly. People want to see Members of this House constructively engage in the legislative process. It has been my experience during my time as a Deputy that some Ministers are open to legislative proposals, while others automatically produce a knee-jerk reaction once a Private Members' Bill is published and they oppose it for whatever reason they can find to justify their attitude.</P>
      <P>If the Minister truly believes the pool from which lawyers are selected to be appointed to the High Court and the Supreme Court should be widened, he should not oppose this Bill because it provides the legislative mechanism which would allow this issue to be further teased out on Committee Stage and for this reforming legislation to become law before the end of the year. However, the real reason the Minister does not like the Bill has nothing to do with the widening of the pool of lawyers from which judges can be selected. The Minister does not like the Bill because the Fianna Fáil Party is still locked into outmoded politics, cronyism and behind the door deals. It fears the proposals in this Bill to make the judicial appointments procedures more transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister was not able to produce a single coherent or persuasive reason, upon the Government nominating someone for appointment to the Judiciary, the name of the nominee should not first go to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its consideration and opinion. The reason is the Government does not want the Oireachtas to participate in that process. The Government does not believe in openness and transparency. It does not recognise that what we need is a democratic revolution. People want to see a change in the way we deal with politics. They want to see a different ethos. <Col N="1675" /> Fianna Fáil is firmly locked into an ethos which is undermining politics and contributing to the increasing cynicism of the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan always has something interesting to say. His verbiage usually runs approximately three minutes ahead of his mental processes and he has done it again tonight. He scored an interesting own goal. I said in this House last night &ndash; not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party contradicted me &ndash; that out of the ten judicial appointments made to date by the Government to the District Court eight secured their appointments as a consequence of private political representations made to the Minister by his ministerial and backbench colleagues, by members of the Progressive Democrats and by the Independent Deputies on whom the Government depends.</P>
    <P>The Government has conspired to corrupt and undermine the application of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995. It gets from a body of integrity a list of seven proposed names for appointment to the Judiciary and then instead of objectively assessing the merits of those candidates, the Minister waits to see which political colleague will make representations to him. Whoever is favoured as wearing the colours of Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats or whoever he may need to appoint to keep the Independents on side he will appoint. That is the wrong procedure and it is not what the public expected to happen after the enactment of the 1995 Act. It is the reintroduction of political cronyism through the back door. Not only has the Minister intro<Col N="1676" /> duced it through the back door, he is behaving in a manner which will undermine public confidence in judicial appointments. The Minister, who is the Minister for Justice, has a particular sacred role in that regard but I hasten to add that this Minister is not only the Minister for Justice, he is the Minister for Equality. Equality how are you. Ten judicial appointments have been made to date to the District Court. An eleventh is about to take place. The name has been made known but the President has not yet made the appointment. Of the 11 people who have been nominated to the District Court in the three and a quarter years in the lifespan of this Government by this Minister, ten of them are men. Is that equality? The Minister for Equality has nominated ten men to the District Court and one woman. How can this Minister retain any public credibility when he talks about the need for equal treatment?</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter for the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply. It concerns accommodation at St. Anthony's special school in Castlebar. I am aware of the pressure on the building unit in the Department of Education and Science. I tabled a question on the number of vacancies there for last night's Adjournment Debate. The consequences of the Sinnott case in the High Court last week will also have consequences for that type of building.</P>
      <P>St. Anthony's has been in existence since 1967. The principal, Mrs. Kavanagh, and some of the staff spent some of the holidays trying to patch up holes in the wall. The building is completely outdated and obsolete. Mr. Bracken, the Department inspector, issued a report in December 1999 after visiting the school with another inspector and he made several points. The nub of the crisis is that the Department wants to provide a four-classroom school with some facilities but with no special computer room. The parents, teachers, staff and community want a five-classroom school with a special computer room, which is part of what the Department is doing with IT 2000 for all schools. I want the Minister to make a ruling on this; it is impossible to make a projection about enrolment for the next ten years, to which the inspector refers. There have been £60 million worth of industrial sites approved in the Castlebar region in the last six weeks; this town's population is exploding and even if people want to enrol their children in mainstream schools there will still be a need for St. Anthony's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> During Question Time today the Minister referred to classes for autistic children arising from the Sinnott case. There are six autistic children attending St. Anthony's and while Mr. Bracken refers in his report to the fact that there might be an autistic class being set up in the Castlebar district, the fifth classroom which is proposed in this case could be used for these autistic children. It would prevent the school from having to reapply for planning permission and going through the whole process of redrafting plans.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to find out the facts of this case and to bear in mind the Minister's words today &ndash; that classes for autistic children usually comprise six students and there are six such children currently in St. Anthony's. It is a dilapidated and obsolete building and I want the Minister of State to make a ruling to the effect that there will be a five-classroom school here with a computer room. The inspector recommends that there should not be, which I find completely contradictory when it comes to Government and Department policy; that policy seeks to have IT facilities in all schools. Castlebar is an information age town and came second to Ennis in the telecommunications competition some years ago.</P>
    <P>Those are the two points I wished to raise &ndash; a five-classroom school and a computer room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing time. I support him on this matter, but it is sad we have to debate this. It is outrageous that this school was approved so many years ago but that we are no further down the line. The school was approved as a five-classroom school and now the Department wants a four-classroom school.</P>
      <P>I compliment Hilda Kavanagh and her staff on working in the conditions they have. Many people in the private sector would have walked out of the school many years ago, but because the children have special needs she has often given up her own office for them. That is outrageous. I was contacted today by a parent from south Mayo who wants to send an autistic child to that school. However, the problem is that the school cannot accept the child as the child needs special care and there is no room. I plead with the Minister of State that whatever has to be done will be done at the meeting scheduled for Friday. This should be a five-classroom school as Castlebar is a growing town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I guarantee that the mainstream schools will not work and we will see that in five or six years. I already have parents coming to me complaining that their children are not getting the attention they need in mainstream schools because those schools cannot deal with their problems. We want <Col N="1680" /> a quick and positive decision on this; we want a five-classroom school. It is wrong that this has not been dealt with before and I compliment Deputy Kenny on raising this issue. Parents from my area have children in that school and it is wrong that those children should suffer. Special facilities for autistic children are needed and I again compliment Hilda Kavanagh and her staff on working in such terrible conditions. I rang the school today and I spoke to a man who was there because he was afraid the flat roof would collapse owing to the rain today in Mayo. That is terrible in the year 2000 when so much money is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the proposed new school at St. Anthony's, Castlebar, County Mayo, and I congratulate the Deputy on his appointment as Education spokesman.</P>
      <P>At present, the school has a staffing level of principal teacher, five assistant teachers and an enrolment of over 50 pupils. The Department of Education and Science initiated architectural planning for the construction of a new school to replace the current prefabricated accommodation. Planning permission and fire certificates have been secured.</P>
      <P>However, the accommodation brief is currently being reviewed having regard to enrolment trends at the school. The Deputies will appreciate that the extent of permanent accommodation to be provided at any school is directly related to the number of students requiring the facilities in the long-term. The Department of Education and Science will have to be satisfied that the student enrolments at St. Anthony's will warrant the additional accommodation sought. A decision on the accommodation brief will be conveyed to the management authorities of the school within the next days.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that there are a very large number of school building projects on hand within the Department. Because of the priority which this Government has given to reversing the evident neglect of our primary schools previously, the spending estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fund raising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the review of the accommodation needs at St. Anthony's will be expedited as speedily possible and I will convey what they have said to the Minister and his officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed closure of the Bons Secours hospital in Tuam is nothing short of a disaster for the people of Tuam, north Galway and south Mayo. I acknowledge the work of the Sisters who have contributed enormously to the health care of thousands of people in this area through the years. Their decision to close the hospital is regretted by many.</P>
      <P>However, this decision will put the sincerity of the Western Health Board and the Minister for Health and Children in providing adequate district hospital care for the Tuam area to the test. The lame excuse of the Western Health Board was that it could not get involved in purchasing the hospital because the building did not suit its requirements while an investment programme in Áras Mhuire &ndash; a geriatric home in Tuam &ndash; was announced in the same statement. This expansion is welcome and necessary and has been sought for over ten years, but where the Western Health Board has missed the point is in determining whether a district hospital with a step-down facility and other vital services is necessary for Tuam and the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>I want the health board and the Minister to outline the basis for the evaluation which would indicate that no such hospital facilities are necessary for Tuam. I challenge the health board to provide me with the basis for that information as I believe no such information is available. We have high-tech hospitals in Galway and Castlebar which are clogged with patients. Gaining admission to UCHG can be arduous and, as everyone knows, space is at a premium.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the thousands of people in this area I want the Minister to know that Tuam needs a district hospital and will not accept anything less. If the Sisters' generosity was the only reason Tuam had a hospital the State should be ashamed. It is now a question of whether it is greed before need; the greed of the Exchequer to save money at the expense of the people of Tuam or the need to provide a decent district hospital for generations to come. The matter is in the Minister's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time. Will the Minister of State <Col N="1682" /> plead with the Minister for Health and Children and urge him to intercede as a matter of urgency with the health board to ensure the continuation of the services provided by the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam for the people of the town, north Galway, south Mayo and Roscommon. Elective surgery was carried out in the hospital over the years and it was also a convalescent home. The loss of such a facility in the area would have a huge impact on the delivery of care to the people of the region. It is imperative before this matter is discussed in detail in committee at a special meeting of the Western Health Board on 3 November that the Minister indicates his support for the continuation of this service in the Tuam area.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Connaughton said, the importance of this and the service the Bon Secours sisters have provided cannot be understated. The evaluation by the Western Health Board of the unsuitability of the facilities at the Bon Secours Hospital is inaccurate and incorrect. With reasonable expense for reconstruction, a fantastic facility can be provided rather than going to the expense of a green field site development as proposed by the health board. Has an undertaking already been given by the health board to someone to continue on its silly way at the cost of denying people in Tuam and the surrounding area the service to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time. The Bon Secours Hospital, Tuam, or The Grove as it is called locally, has played a useful and functional role for generations of people from Tuam, north Galway and the hinterland of south Mayo and south Roscommon. The Grove is more than a nursing home. It is a place where minor surgical procedures are performed and it provides services ranging from x-ray examinations to routine laboratory testing to dental surgery to physiotherapy. Patients can have an adequate period of rest and recuperation there rather than being discharged from busy public hospitals. The staff includes three consultants, a medical physician, a general surgeon and an eye specialist. Local doctors also use the hospital for the care of their private patients. The nursing care is provided by outstanding staff who care for the sick in the highest professional manner. The Grove is also the original home of Tuam Cancer Care and one must pay a great tribute to the Bon Secours sisters for their co-operation and great service through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be consultation in the next few weeks between the Minister for Health and Children, the Bon Secours management, the Western Health Board and doctors and other professional users of the hospital. The decision to close must be deferred. I urge the Minister to discuss these issues with the Bon Secours management and the Western Health Board and I urge him to meet a <Col N="1683" /> delegation from Tuam with a view to providing a community hospital in the town. We do not want important services sucked into the University College Hospital Galway where there will be overcrowding, especially over the Christmas period. I know there are plans for additional beds in the Áras Mhuire welfare home in Tuam, which is welcome, but the closure of the Bon Secours Hospital should be deferred until we see what proposed health services are to be put in place by the Department and the Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three Deputies for raising this issue which is obviously of great importance to them and to the Tuam area. The Bon Secours Hospital, Tuam, is a private hospital and the question of its closure is a matter for the Bon Secours Order. I understand the order intends to transfer patients to the Bon Secours Hospital in Galway city.</P>
      <P>The provision of health services in Galway is a matter for the Western Health Board. I note that the board is expanding the range of services at University College Hospital Galway. A tender has been accepted for phase two of the development and work commenced in June 2000. This phase will include: an intensive care unit, including cardiac intensive care, a burns unit, coronary care unit, additional operating theatres for cardiac surgery and orthopaedic surgery, orthopaedic beds for trauma, a cardiac surgery ward, an MRI unit, upgrading of wards, a radiotherapy department to shelling-out stage, an administrative-concourse area, a medical records-admissions department and a medical social work department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the people of Galway should have the reassurance that the services available to them are being expanded and developed to a high degree.</P>
      <P>The provision of cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and MRI services will establish UCHG as a major centre of excellence in the provision of acute hospital care. It will mean that services which have traditionally been provided in Dublin will be available to the people of the west in their own region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A 30 bed rehabilitation unit for older people is being developed at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway, for which a design team is being put in place. In addition, a 20 bed extension opened in 1999 at Áras Mhic Dara, Carraroe. Under the national development plan, the board <Col N="1684" /> has plans to extend St. Francis community nursing unit in Galway city and to construct a new community nursing unit in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>I understand discussions have taken place between the Bon Secours Order and the Western Health Board regarding the future use of the facilities at Tuam. The board undertook a detailed analysis of patient needs in the Tuam area and an appraisal of the capital and operational costs of three options based on a 50 bed and a 60 bed community hospital for older people. The options were: adaptation of the Bon Secours Hospital, Tuam, an extension of the existing 25 bed community nursing unit on the Dublin Road, Tuam, which is known as Áras Mhuire, or a green field development. The option appraisal showed a capital and operational advantage in extending Áras Mhuire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a time of unprecedented financial prosperity. Never before have we had the opportunity to deal with so many inequalities and issues where the quality of life of people can be improved nor have we been able to have the issue of health care as one of the benchmarks whereby we can judge what progress we are making as a country.</P>
      <P>It was brought to my attention some time ago that young children have had considerable difficulty in gaining access to heart treatment. One can only speculate as to the enormous pressure and trauma on children and their parents in living with this experience. A voluntary group was established some time ago in Kilkenny to give young children requiring heart treatment a chance to live a more normal life. This group, the Children Heartcare Action Group, has had enormous success in gaining access for some children to heart operations in the Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. In other words, a voluntary group based in Kilkenny appears to have had more success than the Department of Health and Children and the health board in sending children to England for heart surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group recently met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and indicated to him that additional funds would need to <Col N="1685" /> be made available to deal with the local regional demand for this treatment. The Minister and his officials should hang their heads in shame at this development and at the revelation that a local voluntary group can make more progress than the officials in the statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The Children Heartcare Action Group grew out of a trust fund which was set up to send a one and a half year old little boy from County Kilkenny to England for an operation. The response to the fundraising event was magnificent and, within weeks of the fundraising committee gathering the money, the boy was sent to England to correct the hole in his heart. This young boy had been languishing on a waiting list for a considerable period and there were serious concerns that he would not survive while waiting for the procedure to be performed.</P>
    <P>There have been other examples which I could mention but will not, where the group has been successful in sending young children for heart operations which help them live more normal lives. One can only think about the huge difference these operations and procedures have made to these children, their parents and relatives &ndash; in other words, to those fortunate enough to be supported by this group.</P>
    <P>I raised this motion to highlight the need for the Minister for Health and Children to investigate fully the reasons Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is unable to cope with referring more children to England for this type of heart surgery and to remove the scandalous bureaucracy which is obviously preventing our health system from dealing with this problem quickly, especially in these urgent cases where heart operations are required. Is it right that a local fundraising group is necessary before some of these children receive heart operations rather than risking their lives on a waiting list? It is unacceptable to be told that we cannot organise our priorities as a society to help very young children overcome problems which can be resolved with treatment. I hope the Minister for Health and Children will be able to give some satisfaction regarding this problem and that the waiting list for children who require heart operations can be rapidly reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter because I share Deputy Hogan's concerns about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is the national paediatric cardiac centre and is, therefore, the only facility which has the necessary expertise to treat children requiring heart surgery. I am very aware of the concern regarding waiting times for children in this specialty and the development of this specialty at the hospital is the subject of ongoing discussions between the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern <Col N="1686" /> Regional Health Authority and the management of hospital.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the difficulties being encountered by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children because of insufficient capacity to deliver the number of paediatric heart operations required nationally. Some of the measures cited by the hospital as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service were the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, a shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques available.</P>
    <P>Approval was given by my Department in 1997 for the development of new theatre suites at the hospital at a cost of over £20 million. When the development is completed the hospital will have five operating theatres &ndash; three new and two existing theatres substantially upgraded &ndash; complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. When these theatres are fully commissioned, it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. I am advised that work on the development is progressing with an expected completion date of 2002.</P>
    <P>In December 1997 my Department allocated the hospital a sum of £500,000 from the cardiac waiting list initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in the most effective and appropriate manner. The hospital proposed to use the funding for a number of measures. These included the provision of an additional four ICU beds, the implementation of a training programme for ICU nurses and the implementation of arrangements for the purchase of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the Department allocated the hospital a sum of £878,550, in 1999, £679,000 and in 2000, £700,000 under the same initiative. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a third cardiac surgeon took up a post in the hospital in August 2000 and a new consultant anaesthetist post has recently been approved.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that the hospital has been experiencing difficulty recruiting specialised nurses. It has appointed a specialist nurse agency to recruit in the Far East on its behalf and the director of nursing at the hospital is involved in oversees recruitment in the UK and the Middle East. The hospital recently advertised the position of a senior nursing personnel officer who will have responsibility for recruitment and retention of key nursing personnel, particularly for ICU and theatre.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children recognises that further interim measures will be required to address the delays in treatment currently being experienced by patients at the <Col N="1687" /> hospital. In this regard, I wish to advise the Deputy that the ERHA recently met with the hospital management and relevant clinical staff. They agreed that the hospital would immediately draw up a submission setting out a comprehensive approach to the management of paediatric cardiac surgery and cardiology. A plan will be agreed between the ERHA and the hospital this month. This plan will include a full assessment of the opportunities for sourcing additional capacity elsewhere, including the UK and other countries. It will also deal with the staffing and infrastructural needs in relation to both cardiac surgery and cardiology.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the hospital has identified options to allow a greater number of patients to go abroad for cardiac surgery and these will be addressed in the plan. I understand that the hospital intends to actively pursue places in the UK but it is also examining the possibilities in other countries. I am confident that this initiative, together with the appointment of additional consultant staff and the completion of the theatre development will have a positive impact on the reduction of waiting times in this specialty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House tonight to take this motion.</P>
      <P>The publication this week by the ESRI of a report on the differentials between wages and conditions for women and men prompted many positive media headlines and commentary. The overriding message was that legislation outlawing labour market discrimination is working and women and men are on their way to being equals when it comes to work opportunities and pay. However, I will hold my breath before celebrating about a figure which shows that wages for women remain 15% below the average wage for an Irish male worker. In addition, women are far less likely to benefit from health insurance provision, a pension or from such facilities as sports and leisure activities associated with their workplace.</P>
      <P>It has taken a full decade for the differential between women's and men's pay to drop by five percentage points. I hope it will not take three more decades before women are in receipt of the same average wages and benefits as their male counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its report, the ESRI went a long way to explain why disparities still exist in wages for women and men. Women, according to the report, accrue less workplace experience because of child care responsibilities and, therefore, it takes longer for them to reach the same wage levels as their male colleagues. Should not the workplace facilitate the rearing of the next generation? <Col N="1688" /> I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me that it should.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report this week highlighted once again the abysmal provisions, both at a private level in companies and by the State, in the area of child care. Access to proper child care, which is both affordable and of a high quality, would ensure that working women could pursue their careers and raise their families. In addition, the responsibilities of parenthood must be shared and they should be an issue for men in the workplace as well as for women, employers and the State.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the feel-good factor from this report that women are at last on their way to being equals in the workplace, the latest live register statement for September showed a worrying trend. While there was a welcome drop in the figures, the extent of the reduction in the numbers of women signing on was an indication that many are in insecure employment and are forced to sign on during summer months and other holiday periods.</P>
    <P>It is an unacceptable trend that large numbers of women join the live register in June and July yet come September they appear to be back in employment. This pattern of signing on and signing off suggests that women are the main victims of casual, atypical and temporary employment. The Government has placed a strong emphasis on encouraging more women to join the labour market. Its controversial introduction of individualisation to the tax code is just one example of its enthusiasm to get more women working. However, not enough is being done to ensure that when women enter the workforce they are afforded better working conditions which do not see them signing on while the rest of us take holidays. Up to 73% of part-time workers are women and their rights are not always protected.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the State to promote and make way for equality of access to men and women in the labour market. The introduction of paid parental leave, paternity leave and better access to child care facilities are all crucial elements in ensuring that parental responsibility is shared and assisted by both working parents.</P>
    <P>Another relevant requirement is to ensure that girls at school have full access to more technical subjects and that they are encouraged to take them up. Germany, Sweden and other EU states show much higher participation rates of girls in technical subjects, which it seems in Ireland are still the preserve of boys</P>
    <P>I wish to focus attention on the large number of women who are currently not in the active labour market because their need to care for children and older people in the home are preventing them from accessing paid employment. An assessment of the value of such work must be undertaken. In addition, there are thousands of farm women who make a huge contribution to the management of farms throughout this agri<Col N="1689" /> culture-dependent economy who are not recognised under the tax code. Equally, women's contribution in this regard needs to be considered in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Equality must be meaningful to women in the workplace, it must result in equal numbers of women in management positions, equal access to work related benefits, parity of pay and recognition of work carried out in the home, on the farm and in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this important issue. This motion is timely because of the launch this week of the ESRI's report, How Unequal? Men and Women in the Irish Labour Market, which records a narrowing of the gap in hourly earnings between men and women. The 1997 data shows that women earn 84.5% of the average male wage as compared with 80% in 1987. This data includes all economic sectors and benefits such as pensions. It is the most comprehensive and up to date data we have on this subject and it complements the CSO figures on manufacturing industry which show a wider gap of 28% in male and female earnings. The CSO figures relate to one in five of women workers and are not representative of the full economy.</P>
      <P>Narrowing of the gap marks sustained progress on the achievement of equal opportunities between women and men at work. Most of the remaining gap of 15.5% arises from the fact that women spend on average six years out of the work force with child care responsibilities over their working lives. When this difference is taken into account the gap between male and female hourly earnings narrows to 5%.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's chief concern is to establish what initiatives we have taken to continue to make a difference. In launching the ESRI research on 9 October, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform highlighted the need for a continued focus on equality of opportunity to ensure that women get fair treatment in employment. The additional resources provided to the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations will assist in this by ensuring a swift, professional response to inquiries from employers, trade unions and employees. Also, the current labour market creates a favourable climate for furthering gender equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further support for ensuring that pay and conditions for women at work are the same as their male counterparts, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has provided the Equality Authority with funding to carry out gender audits in conjunction with employers, trade unions and employees. A number of employers have already expressed an interest in embarking on this process. There will be a focus on mapping the gender profile of organisations and recording <Col N="1690" /> the recruitment and promotion systems to ensure they conform with best practice. The intention is that this funding will help bring a greater level of equal opportunity between men and women to the workplace.</P>
    <P>The ESRI research referred to by the Deputy noted that the concentration of women in low paid jobs prevented further narrowing of the gender pay gap. Further inroads to tackling the gender pay difference must therefore focus on equipping women with relevant labour market qualifications. Also relevant is the development of education and training systems which combine lifelong learning with employment. The equality for women measure which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced on 5 October will provide funding for such initiatives including projects offering women the opportunity to retrain, up-skill and advance in their careers. Employers, trade unions and groups of employees are invited to submit project proposals which aim to tackle the gender pay gap including mentoring programmes, personal development courses and networking supports.</P>
    <P>The ESRI research also noted the need for supports for women who are returning to the work force after a long absence. The Partnership 2000 report on women's access to labour market opportunities sets out a number of recommendations in this regard. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is funding further research in this area concerned with identifying the information and guidance needs of women returning to the labour market.</P>
    <P>Also relevant in tackling the gender pay gap is the question of statutory rights relating to maternity and parental leave, child care supports and family friendly working arrangements. The review of the maternity protection legislation which is being chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and includes the social partners and relevant Departments and bodies is at an advanced stage. The Parental Leave Act makes an important contribution to gender equality by providing for the right for each parent to parental leave, which is not transferable from one to the other.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives by the Government which are likely to have a positive effect on the gender pay gap are: the adoption in April 2000 of the Statutory Minimum Wage of £4.40 per hour; the forthcoming carers' leave Bill which will make it possible for employees to take carer's leave from their employment and employment rights will be protected during this absence. This is expected to be particularly important for women, who constitute the majority of carers; the forthcoming Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Bill, 2000 which seeks to provide equal treatment for part-time workers with their full time colleagues. As women constitute 71% of part-time workers this is clearly of major importance to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> The Government remains committed to working on all of these different levels and within social partnership to ensure that pay and conditions for women at work are the same as for their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this issue <Col N="1692" /> which is very timely because of the equality for women measures announced on 5 October and the ESRI research which was launched on 9 October.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 October 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Gross expenditure by my Department on primary education for 2000 is estimated to be £1,064 million which is 1.56% of GNP. Gross expenditure for the post-primary sector is £1,270 million which is 1.86% of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OECD has published the most recent international comparisons available to my Department. The data relate to the 1997 year but are based on comparisons with gross domestic product rather than GNP. Furthermore, the OECD data are based on the expenditure from public and private sources for educational institutions and are aggregated on the basis of <Col N="1695" /> primary-lower secondary and upper secondary-further education levels rather than primary and secondary.</P>
    <P>A tabular statement of the resulting comparison for EU member states is being circulated in the Official Report. In summary the comparative data indicate that Ireland's expenditure on primary and lower secondary education represented 2.6% of GDP compared to an EU average of 2.3%. Expenditure by country ranged from 3.2% to 2%. In relation to expenditure on upper secondary and further education, Ireland's expenditure represented 0.9% compared to an EU average of 1.4%. Expenditure by country ranged from 2% to 0.9%.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The standard capitation grants which is the main source of funding towards the running costs of primary schools, has been increased from £45 in 1997 to £71 in the current school year. This represents an increase of almost 58% over that period.</P>
    <P>At second level, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased from £177 to £184 last year and has been further increased by £8 from September this year to £192. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, schools have also benefited from the IT 2000 initiative and the library books grant.</P>
    <P>I also recently announced the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. This is a major funding initiative under which schools will receive a grant of £20 per pupil in respect of support services with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. I regard this initiative as a significant advance in the funding of our schools. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>his policy in respect of the communication systems taught in the schools for the deaf; if the official policy remains one of oralism; the policy in respect of Irish sign language and signed English; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21460/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogeneous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for individual children, in consultation with their parents on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communications systems, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English.</P>
      <P>If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the option is for Irish sign language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is an increasing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account. In this regard I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a small number of classes in which sign language is the medium for communication and teaching. We have also provided four special needs assistants, who are themselves deaf, for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also <Col N="1697" /> provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultations with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and individuals, including individual parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has already been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>I also have decided to set up a representative advisory committee which will offer guidance on key future developments in the education of the deaf.</P>

      <P>Cork Institute of Technology submitted proposals for outreach provision in Skibbereen on 12 June 1997. The proposals have been and continue to be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The issue of outreach centres was addressed in the final report of the technical working group on the review of outreach centres of higher education institutions which was published in April of this year.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that my plans are to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and third level institutions. In this context I have recently had top level discussions with representatives of the Church, local authorities and elected representatives in Wexford and Kilkenny as well as senior staff from the Institute of Technology, Carlow and the NUI, Maynooth.</P>
      <P>I will address the proposals in relation to Skibbereen in the context of my overall approach to outreach centres.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have previously welcomed the report, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding provisions for second level schools and I have commended the group for the clarity of its approach and the quality of the analysis undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of <Col N="1698" /> equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would draw the attention of the Deputy to my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <Quest>the current state of development of the escort scheme for pupils with particular special needs; the number of applications on hand that have not yet been approved; the remuneration involved for such escorts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has allocated funding of £2.2 million to schools in the current school year to facilitate the provision of an escort service on every special school transport route carrying pupils to special schools and special classes. The service in question involves a total of 594 individual routes serving 153 schools.</P>
      <P>Funding has been allocated to the relevant schools on the basis of an annual payment of £4,995 per escort.</P>
      <P>The number of transport routes in place can vary during the school year as additional provision for children with special needs comes on stream. Since funding was originally allocated for the current school year, a further eight special transport routes have been approved. Arrangements are currently being made in my Department to allocate funding to the schools in question to facilitate the appointment of escorts on those routes. Funding will also be made available for any further routes which may be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of schools expressed reservations about undertaking responsibility for the escort <Col N="1699" /> scheme when it was first introduced in September 1999. However, I am pleased to say that many of the schools in question have since proceeded to implement the scheme and that escorts are now in place on the great majority of routes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the schools for their commitment in putting in place the escort scheme for their pupils. As previously indicated in the House, I am in no doubt that the school authorities, who are familiar with their children's needs and behaviours, are best placed to ensure the successful operation of the escort scheme.</P>
    <P>I have requested my officials to consider further the concerns which have been expressed by some schools regarding the administrative burden involved in operating the scheme and the adequacy of the current rate of payment for escorts. My objective is to ensure that the commitment shown by schools in undertaking the operation of this important scheme will be supported by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of means for all applicants under the third level student support schemes is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments.</P>
      <P>When assessing income from self-employment and farming, the amount assessed is the adjusted profit-loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are of general application.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year. Accordingly, I recently announced an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant for the 2000-01 academic year is £20,200. A sliding scale of entitlement exists whereby candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-main<Col N="1700" /> tenance grant, 50%, in respect of which, the income limit is £21,400. Where two or more children, or the candidate's parent, are attending full-time approved third level courses, the above income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, by £4,540 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270. Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>The schemes of student support are subject to ongoing review. Officials of my Department have been engaged with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the options for the future administration of these schemes. Terms of reference for a detailed review of the administration of the schemes are currently being finalised between my officials and officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The proposed terms of reference include provision for a review of means testing.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties parents of children with histories of behavioural problems may have in seeking entry to a school of their choice. The issues of access to education and school attendance are related to that of early school leaving. This is a complex and difficult area and in order to make progress we must tackle the problem on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in primary and post-primary schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools in the first instance. For this reason my Department has no information on the numbers of children who may have been refused entry to the school of their choice for any reason, including that of having a history of behavioural problems in previous schools.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, has made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances at school level, including a refusal to enrol, and my Department is working on the implementation of these at present. The full implementation of the Act will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to enrolment and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in relation to a refusal to enrol will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing school placements for pupils out of school. It liaises with school authorities with a view to hav<Col N="1701" /> ing the pupils back in full-time education as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The structure of the current system for monitoring school attendance is such that I cannot, at present, provide details of the number of children outside education. The enforcing authorities for the School Attendance Act, 1926, in Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire are the respective corporations or councils. Outside these areas, the gardaí are the enforcing authorities. There is no national authority to monitor or co-ordinate school attendance data at a national level.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there are children who may not be in school, whatever the reason. The recently enacted Education Welfare Act provides a new framework to address school attendance. The Act provides for a comprehensive range of measures to address the problem of non-school attendance. Among the key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility to co-ordinate action in relation to school attendance on a countrywide basis. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school.</P>
    <P>The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. Accordingly, it will be possible to address in a structured way the problem of early school leaving. The educational welfare officer will be responsible for dealing with students who exhibit patterns of irregular attendance at school. These officers will seek to identify underlying problems causing such irregular attendance and to support and assist students, and their families, experiencing difficulties with school attendance.</P>
    <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough and it is vital that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support students to remain in education to the conclusion of senior cycle. The stay in school initiative is designed to focus resources on problems where the drop out rate is most acute. At the core of this new strategy is the empowerment of schools to devise plans to address the particular problems that they themselves identify.</P>
    <P>This issue is not a simple one and in order to have a real chance of success the solution must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

      <Quest>the level of Government funding provided for the running costs of all primary schools; the actual costs incurred; and the plans he has to meet this shortfall.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main source of funding of the run<Col N="1702" /> ning costs of primary schools is the capitation grant. As the Deputy may be aware, the standard capitation grant at primary level, which stood at £45 in 1997, has increased to £71 per pupil in the current school year. Total expenditure on capitation grants increased from £25.367 million in 1997 to a projected £33.939 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in capitation funding, the Government has also increased funding to primary schools by way of a number of grants issued to primary schools since 1997. These include the library grant (1998), amounting to £4 million, the science and infants grant (1999) which totalled £3.1 million, and the reading initiative grant (1999) which amounted to £3.7 million. It addition, it is intended to circulate details of a physical education grant and a visual arts grant to all primary schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under a minor works grant scheme, funds are provided to primary schools towards items such as replacement of windows, roof repairs, repainting and redecorating, as well as improvements to mechanical and electrical services. A total of £14.3 million has been provided under this scheme in the current year.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides funding to primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services. In the current year a total of £7.4 million is being spent on full time school caretakers and secretaries, while a further £12.2 million is being paid on a <i>per capita</i> basis to schools to enable them to acquire the services of caretakers and secretaries. All primary schools now have access to funding for caretaking and clerical services, and the total funding in 2001 will be further increased to £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>I regret that it is not possible to give details of the costs incurred by primary schools, as requested by the Deputy. Running costs vary significantly from school to school, due to factors such as the size, location, age and condition of the school. Therefore, it is not possible to make valid comparisons between the level of grants paid by my Department and the actual costs of running a school.</P>
      <P>The increases in the capitation grant, allied to the additional grant funding constitute a meaningful response to the need for increased funding in the primary sector. I am committed to improving further the levels of funding to primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education currently includes the provision of infant classes in national schools and support for a range of initiatives aimed at children who are disadvantaged and children who have special needs.</P>
      <P>Pre-school provision for the coming school year, other than infants classes in primary schools, will include early start pre-school pilot programme, catering for a maximum of 1,680 children; Rutland Street Pre-School project, currently catering for 84 children; 52 pre-schools for Travellers catering for up to 520 Traveller children; and a pilot pre-school provision for autistic children, catering for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 644 pre-school children avail of all-day child care under the child care measure provided by the vocational education committees to support access of unemployed and early school leaver parents to VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller programmes.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on early childhood education &ndash; Ready to Learn &ndash; sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector, with the aim of building on existing provision and assisting providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs are not being met by existing State funded services.</P>
      <P>More generally, the White Paper also sets out a range of proposals designed to assist providers. These include the development of a quality in education mark to be awarded to providers who meet defined standards concerning matters such as curriculum and staff training. Supports will also be developed in a number of other areas including the production of materials and developmentally appropriate guidelines; research, development and dissemination of best practice; the provision of an advice, evaluation and inspection service; the development of a framework for qualifications; and the provision of incentives for schools to make suitable premises available for pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, is currently under way in my Department. Detailed implementation of the White Paper proposals will be undertaken following the completion of the planning process.</P>

      <P>In recent years, successive Governments have adopted a policy of broadening the inclusiveness of the traditional senior cycle. In line with that policy, a transition year programme has been developed and the traditional leaving certificate programme has been broadened to incorporate three strands, the established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme, and the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>In 2000, about 23% of the candidates who sat the leaving certificate followed either the leaving certificate vocational or the leaving certificate applied programme. The leaving certificate and the leaving certificate vocational programme have been broadened considerably over the past decade. They are broad general educational programmes with some academic subjects and a number of practical-vocational subjects. Within the leaving certificate vocational programme, participants take a specific element link modules preparation for work, work experience and enterprise education.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently undertaking a review of senior cycle education in the medium to long-term and will publish a discussion document in 2001. Particular attention will be given in the review to breadth and balance of subjects in the established leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied programme has been designed specifically for those for whom the other two programmes might not be considered suitable and who may be in danger of not completing the senior cycle. The NCCA has conducted a survey of the destination of those who have completed the LCA in each of the years 1997 to 1999 and on average 40% were employed with 35% in vocational training programmes each year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1999 the Government announced a £194 million multi-sectoral allocation over a three-year period to alleviate the effects of educational disadvantage. The allocation for primary education is in excess of £25 million and entailed a survey of all primary schools so that the levels of concentration in them of children with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving could be identified. My Department contracted the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to carry out this survey. Replies to the survey were received from 75% of primary schools and this level of response is considered to be high compared with levels of response to other postal surveys.</P>
      <P>In advance of the survey, a circular was issued by my Department to all primary schools. In it, schools were advised of the forthcoming questionnaire. They were informed of the purposes of the survey and advised that resources would be allocated to the schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils. They were also exhorted to return the completed questionnaires. The questionnaires were then issued by the ERC and schools were subsequently advised of an extended closing date for receipt of returns. In effect, therefore, the schools received three communications about the survey.</P>
      <P>There was a very high incidence of returns of the questionnaire from schools designated by my Department as serving areas of disadvantage and from rural schools in the Breaking the Cycle project. This would seem to suggest that the incidence of non-completion was highest among those schools least likely to qualify for additional resources.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the relevant officers in my Department and the ERC will continue to work in close co-operation on this issue. As soon as current analyses are completed, the programme is launched and resources are allocated to the selected schools, further analysis of aspects of the survey, including the non-completion rate, will be carried out and decisions will be made regarding future actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy that, as far as possible, Traveller children participate in mainstream education in age-appropriate classes and in an integrated setting.</P>
      <P>To ensure that this policy translates into practice, my Department provides a range of supports. Capitation grants at enhanced rates are paid in respect of Traveller pupils in primary and post-primary schools. My Department sanctions resource teacher posts in primary schools where a minimum of 14 Traveller pupils have enrolled. Additional teaching hours are sanctioned in respect of Traveller children enrolled in post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department employs a national education officer for Travellers and a visiting teacher service for travellers. The visiting teachers provide advice and support to schools and to Traveller families. I have recently sanctioned the appointment of ten additional visiting teacher posts bringing to 40 the total number of posts in that service. A major focus of the work of the visiting teacher service is encouraging greater participation in education by Traveller children both in terms of achieving regular attendance and of retention in full-time education.</P>
      <P>In addition, Traveller children will benefit from the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative and the Stay in School retention initiative. These are key programmes which have been put in place to help to prevent early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The Education Welfare Act is designed to ensure that all children of compulsory school-going age attend school, or, if they do not attend school, that they receive at least a minimum education. The Act will help to address some of the underlying causes of truancy and help to identify children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems.</P>
      <P>My Department does not maintain statistics on the number of Traveller children taught on a county by county basis. The most recent figures available from the national education officer for travellers concern the school year 1999-00. There are some 537 in pre-schools; 5,600 in primary schools; 962 in post-primary schools; 120 in junior education centres; some 149 special schools for Travellers; and some 7,368 Traveller children in total.</P>

      <P>My Department makes provision for such children through the establishment of special dedicated classes which are generally attached to ordinary primary schools. Each such class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 7:1 and the children attending these classes attract a special rate of capitation funding. In arranging for the establishment of these special classes, my Department works closely with the relevant health authority to ensure that the necessary speech therapy service is made available to the pupils.</P>
      <P>There are three special classes for children with speech and language disorders on the north side of Dublin at present. Further special classes will be established where a need is identified on the basis of processional assessments. My Department does not have details regarding waiting lists for such services. However, where a need is identified, every effort is made to put the necessary education and speech therapy services in place as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>The national educational psychological service, is currently available to all second level schools in the country and approximately one quarter of all primary schools, including 29 primary schools in County Mayo. Unfortunately, Foxford primary school is not yet included in the service. However, the process of extending the service nationwide is continuing as additional psychologists are recruited.</P>
      <P>My Department has received an application for resource teacher support in respect of a number of children with special needs attending Foxford primary school. This application is currently being examined by my Department's inspectorate. As soon as the inspectorate has reported, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Foxford primary school was considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme when it was last expanded in 1994. However, the school did not rank high enough on the priority list to secure inclusion in the scheme on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I attach particular importance to the issue of educational disadvantage. I will shortly be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in this process, in April of this year, the educational research centre issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the school referred to by the <Col N="1709" /> Deputy. Work on analysing the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for the identification of levels of disadvantage in every responding school. Based on the results of the survey, I intend allocating additional resources to the selected schools. Differing levels of intervention will include extra teacher support and-or extra funding depending on the nature and level of the need identified.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of the Schools IT 2000 Programme, which has been in operation for almost three years now, is to further develop the integration of information and communications technologies into Irish primary and second level education. The programme is of major importance in supporting all of our young people in acquiring the ICT skills necessary for their full participation in this information age. Ireland was lagging significantly behind many of its European partners in this area when the programme was launched in late 1997. My Department felt it necessary to address this by supporting every school in making progress as quickly as possible. Grants were issued to all primary and second level schools in 1998 and 1999 to support them in developing their ICT infrastructure.</P>
      <P>It was decided to issue the second instalment of grant aid to all schools in late 1999, even to the 25% or so who had not yet submitted a final return on their phase 1 expenditure, in order to maintain the momentum towards achieving the national objectives of the programme and in order to continue to stimulate ICT related activity in every school. My Department's judgment was that the need to make rapid progress was paramount in 1998 and 1999.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the extent of the progress highlighted by a recent survey carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that this approach was justified. Preliminary findings from this survey include the average primary school now has 8.7 computers, up from 3.8 in early 1998; the average second level school now has 42.7 computers, up from 31 in early 1998; more than 95% of schools state that they are using the Internet, up from only 25% in early 1998; and well over 30,000 teachers have attended one or more IT training courses since early 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> I can assure the Deputy that urgent attention will continue to be given to ensuring that the grants issued to every school are properly accounted for by the return of the necessary records to the NCTE. This matter is being vigorously pursued at present with the assistance of the 17 ICT advisers currently in place in education centres around the country.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the Deputy that, in future, ICT grants will be issued only to those schools which have provided all of the required returns in respect of previous grant payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the United Nations Committee reflects the report of the OECD International adult literacy survey results for Ireland, published in 1997. This showed that 25% of the adult population, representing some 500,000 people, had inadequate literacy skills. It is important to stress that this was not a survey of illiteracy, but rather of the different levels of skills which are needed for participation in a modern economy. These adults were found to score at the lowest level, level 1, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information and when the structure of the text assists the task.</P>
      <P>Since the survey, this Government has given a high priority to developing adult literacy programmes. The adult literacy budget has been increased from less than £0.85 million prior to 1997 to almost £9 million this year. The sum of £73.6 million is being provided for a national adult literacy strategy under the national development plan for the period 2000-6.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives has been progressed as part of the expansion of the service in co-operation with the vocational education committees, the National Adult Literacy Agency and training and employment interests. These include the establishment of an adult literacy development fund to support awareness, Outreach, referral networks and flexible provision. As a result the numbers availing of the service have increased from 5,000 in 1997 to almost 13,500 this year. A quality framework has been developed and nationally certified in service programmes for staff are being implemented. A directory of adult literacy services has been published to promote awareness of contact points for the service. The first phase of development of an adult guidance service has been initiated, and phase 2 will begin in early 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> One of our more exciting initiatives is the screening of the adult literacy programme &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; on RTE. The aim of this series of 12 half-hour programmes is to reach a mass audience, to enable adults to improve their reading and writing skills in the privacy of their own homes, to promote awareness of where to go for help, and to encourage adults to join their local literacy schemes. The TV ratings indicate that some 153,000 people watched the first programme, 192,000 watched the second programme, and 64,000 and 28,000, respectively, watched the repeats of these the following day.</P>
    <P>The series is accompanied by a free learner pack, which will be available from NALA, the National Adult Literacy Agency. A special freephone support service operated by NALA is also provided through which experienced tutors help with any queries about the TV series or the pack and refer callers to a local literacy scheme.</P>
    <P>An Inter-Departmental Committee on Literacy for the unemployed has been convened by my Department, which is working with the National Adult Literacy Agency, FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS-funded community employment scheme are under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Adult Education &ndash; Learning for Life &ndash; sets out the Government's commitment to further develop this critical area, and sets out a detailed strategy to expand adult learning opportunities generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to the school population, national assessments of English reading with fifth class pupils were carried out in 1993 and 1998 by inspectors of my Department in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. The report of these assessments has just been published. In 1990-91 the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement conducted a reading literacy study in 32 educational systems throughout the world. Irish nine year olds and 14 year olds participated in the study. Estimates from national and international studies indicate that approximately 10% of Irish school pupils have serious literacy problems. These issues are being addressed through the expansion of the remedial service to all primary and post-primary schools, reforms of the remedial service in line with an expert evaluation, a major investment in the provision of school library books and the national reading initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way, under the terms of the schemes, based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The means by which such assistance is to be provided by schools to needy pupils &ndash; financial assistance, vouchers or provision of books on loan-rental schemes &ndash; is a matter for the individual school authorities. Consequently, my Department does not have details of the number of schools operating book loan-rental schemes at second level.</P>
      <P>Seed capital grant aid has been provided, since 1994, to schools at second level which are categorised as disadvantaged, which did not already have a loan rental scheme in place, and which gave a commitment to arrange for such a scheme, to assist them in the establishment of book loan-rental schemes. The intention is to provide some specific financial seed support for the introduction or expansion of book rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis, for a maximum of six years, five years in the case of five year cycle schools. It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan-rental schemes which, after the initial special assistance, will operate on a self-financing basis where ongoing costs will be met by fee income, which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grant scheme allocation.</P>
      <P>The level of funding provided for each year since the inception of the scheme is not readily available in my Department. In 1999, a total of £4,463,000 was allocated in aid towards the cost of school books for needy pupils in second level schools. This allocation included some £430,000, which was provided specifically as seed capital for book rental schemes in disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The total provision at second level for 2000 is £4,552,000 from which £165,000 approximately will be made available to disadvantaged schools as seed capital for book rental schemes. The seed capital allocation decreased this year because the majority of the disadvantaged schools concerned have reached the end of their five or six year cycle of seed capital funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation at primary level for 2000 is £2,637,000 under the needy pupils book scheme. <Col N="1713" /> Principal teachers decide whether they will operate a loan-rental scheme in their school or whether they will provide individual grant assistance. Primary schools that operate loan-rental schemes receive a higher rate of grant aid.</P>

      <P>There are 453 teachers in primary schools currently paid at the untrained rate.</P>
      <P>All teachers are paid on a common basic incremental scale. A teacher whose initial training consists of a three year training course will be placed on the second point of the scale, while those with four years or more full-time training commence on the third point of the scale. Qualified primary teachers who are appointed to temporary or permanent teaching posts may apply to my Department for the award of incremental credit in respect of teaching service abroad, or in respect of relevant non teaching service.</P>
      <P>A claim for a living in Dublin allowance has not been submitted by the teacher unions. If such a claim were submitted it would be considered by the Teachers Conciliation Council.</P>
      <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification, which is awarded on successful completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale College, Milltown or in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the NCEA, are recognised to teach in special schools and in special classes in mainstream primary schools. They are also regarded as qualified for resource teaching posts for pupils with special needs and for substitute teaching service in mainstream primary schools.</P>
      <P>The existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed at present. Following completion of that review, it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori trained teachers as primary school teachers.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to establish a course to enable untrained persons who have served primarily in a substitute capacity to obtain qualifications to deem them suitable for appointment as qualified primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The education system has as one of its objectives the production of well-balanced and rounded individuals who have developed responsible attitudes as members of society. This objective permeates the curriculum in our schools, at both first and second levels, and provides a safeguard against the influence of negative forces such as racism. I have had the pleasure of visiting many of our schools where children of different nationalities and cultures are very happily integrated.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the revised curriculum includes social, personal and health education which is designed to enable children to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions as citizens in a free and democratic society now and in the future. This programme is delivered on an integrated, cross-curricular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civic, social and political education is part of the core curriculum for all second level schools. This subject is based on a number of central concepts including democracy, rights and responsi<Col N="1715" /> bilities, human dignity and law. The study of civic, social and political education helps pupils to understand and respect human rights. It helps them to become aware of the issue of discrimination and of the need to guard against it in all its forms. One of the key aims of civic, social and political education is the development of skills to allow pupils to participate fully in the democratic process. It helps students to recognise this participation as a basic human right for all, regardless of such matters as ethnic or racial identity.</P>
    <P>Both social, personal and health education and civic, social and political education involve a broad focus on issues of rights, justice and good citizenship. This approach provides a more effective response than would a programme focusing specifically on the issue of racism.</P>
    <P>Schools are given sufficient flexibility to adapt the curriculum, in line with particular needs and priorities at any given time, in order to address issues such as racism. There is considerable scope for this in the transition year programme.</P>

      <P>Last year my Department published a revised primary curriculum which includes a programme in physical education for all primary classes. The revised primary curriculum is being implemented on a phased basis with the assistance of a primary curriculum support programme for teachers and schools. This support programme will include physical education. The new curriculum in physical education was devised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. The curriculum was designed in accordance with international best practice in the teaching and learning of PE. The new PE curriculum is divided into six strands: athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics and it is recommended that all schools, where possible, provide ongoing learning experiences at all class levels in five of these strands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 the research and development committee of my Department supported a large nationwide study of PE in senior primary school classes. The results of the research indicate that 85% of Irish children participate in physical activity four or more times weekly and that they are slightly <Col N="1716" /> more physically active than their peers in many European countries.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I have launched the primary school sports initiative to promote sport, PE and healthy lifestyles among primary school children and have established an advisory group to advise on the implementation of the initiative. As part of this initiative, additional funds will be provided for primary schools. This funding includes an annual grant of £1000 in respect of coaching, mentoring and equipment for each primary school in a disadvantaged area and £500 for all other primary schools. I have no doubt that this initiative will be an important support for PE in our primary schools.</P>

      <P>The issue of the declining numbers of students taking science subjects has been a source of concern for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should stress that the issue is one of the uptake of the physical sciences at senior cycle. At junior cycle the uptake of science has been fairly constant at close to 90% of the cohort for a number of years. At leaving certificate the uptake of biology, although it has shown some decrease in recent years, has been relatively constant in the longer term. Also at leaving certificate, uptake of <Col N="1717" /> agricultural science has actually increased somewhat in recent years albeit from a fairly low base.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently implementing a range of initiatives with a view to addressing the declining interest in the physical sciences. A major programme of investment in modernising school science laboratories is being put in place. This involves the expenditure of some £12 million over three years. As part of this strategy, schools recently received a grant of £4,000 towards the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment specifically for use in science laboratories. An additional per capita grant of £10 for each student studying physics or chemistry was introduced from September 1999.</P>
    <P>New syllabi in both leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for examination in June 2002. These syllabi include an increased emphasis on science, technology and society, STS and on practical work, as well as a revision of syllabus content. The NCCA is also currently undertaking a review of the junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
    <P>The structure and layout of questions in the leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry ordinary level examination papers have been improved with a view to making these papers more accessible to the cohort of candidates for whom they are intended. At junior level, the format of the examination paper in ordinary level science was also changed this year.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry has been under way since September 1999. During the 1999-2000 school year, all 900 teachers of physics and all 1,000 teachers of chemistry had the opportunity of attending two and a half days' in-service training. The programme is designed to run for a further two years.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive reference handbooks for teachers of physics and chemistry have been distributed to every second level school in both printed and CD-ROM format.</P>
    <P>Science resource centres have been established in selected regions. These centres, which are based in second level school laboratories, are designed to act as a focus for the provision of inservice training for science teachers. They also help in developing an ethos of mutual support among science teachers.</P>
    <P>There is no room for complacency in relation to this issue and I am examining further strategies to build on current initiatives. The establishment of a national science centre must be considered in the context of the Government's overall strategy in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the terms of these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to their third level course. Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>Any revision in the terms of the scheme would have to be considered in the light of available financial resources and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years' duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are, however, a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses, including those leading to the award of bachelor of education.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the student support schemes in regard to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the report of Sir Ron Dearing on the future of higher education, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to establish a representative advisory committee to offer guidance to my Department on a range of key issues relating to the future education of deaf children, including the issue of sign language.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the debate concerning the best method of teaching deaf children and the changes in methods that have occurred over the years. It is acknowledged that no single method of communication is suitable to all deaf students. In this context, the assessed needs of the individual child are of central importance, when, in consultation with the child's parents, decisions are being made regarding appropriate educational provision.</P>
      <P>While final decisions regarding the terms of reference and membership of the proposed advisory committee have not yet been taken in my Department, it would be my intention that the committee will give adequate representation to all those involved in the delivery of education services for the hearing impaired and in particular, members of the deaf community.</P>

      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and other relevant interests. This programme is called Walk Tall. The development took place in a small number of primary schools during the schools years 1996-97 and 1997-98. On the basis of a positive evaluation of the programme, the associated detailed educational resource materials were designed and printed before the end of 1998. It was decided to disseminate the programme to all primary schools over a two year period beginning in early 1999. The programme has now been introduced to approximately 2,400 primary schools, about 75% of all primary schools. This includes a significant proportion of rural schools.</P>
      <P>There is a support team of six teacher trainers, including a national project officer involved in the dissemination process. The administration of the process is located in West Dublin Education Centre which works in co-operation with education centres throughout the country. Detailed educational resource materials are available for each class level in primary schools and are provided free of charge to schools when the programme is introduced in schools after participation by the teaching staffs of the schools in one-day training seminars. In addition to these training seminars, further longer training courses for teachers are also organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level the substance misuse prevention programme, On My Own Two Feet, has been introduced in approximately 570 post-primary schools, many of which are schools serving rural areas. The dissemination of this programme commenced in early 1995 and has continued each year since. Following on a recommendation from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, my Department decided that social, personal and health education, including substance <Col N="1721" /> misuse prevention education, would be phased in to all schools at junior cycle over a three year period, beginning in September 2000. A support service for SPHE consisting of a national co-ordinator and ten regional development officers has been put in place. This service will work in partnership with regional health board health promotion personnel. Substance misuse prevention will feature strongly in the work of the support service.</P>

      <Quest>if recent leaving certificate and junior certificate results show major disparities between males and females; if so, his views on the reason for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish experience in relation to examination performance of males and females mirrors the international experience. There is a growing trend internationally for females to achieve better results than males in terms of examination performance at the end of upper second level education. This trend has been evident in Ireland for the past ten years or so and is also reflected in the respective performances of females and males in GCSE O and A Level examinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment commissioned research by the Educational Research Centre &ndash; ERC &ndash; St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the Economic Social and Research Institute &ndash; ERSI &ndash; which includes analysis of the factors contributing to the performance of candidates in examinations. The ERC conducted a longitudinal study of 1994 junior certificate candidates who took the leaving certificate examination in 1996 or 1997. The results confirm that the underachievement of males relative to females at junior certificate level is maintained in the leaving certificate examination. This pattern is also repeated in the case of the 2000 certificate examination results where females outscore males on most subjects at junior certificate and leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of the results for 16 major subjects at leaving certificate level for 2000 shows that girls perform better than boys in terms of the percentage who achieve at least a grade C at higher level as follows: Irish, English, French, German &ndash; on average 7% more girls attain a grade C; mathematics and science subjects &ndash; on average 4% more girls attain a grade C; business subjects &ndash; on average 2% more girls attain a grade C (boys outscore girls in economics); humanities subjects &ndash; on average 6% more girls attain a grade C. At junior certificate level for 13 major subjects the difference is greater: languages 5%, mathematics and science subjects 4%, busi<Col N="1722" /> ness subjects 3%, humanities subjects 4%. At ordinary level at both leaving and junior certificate the performance gap widens in all subjects.</P>
    <P>Do Schools Differ, a research project undertaken by the ESRI for my Department, explored the impact of schooling factors on a range of pupil outcomes at junior and leaving certificate level. This research confirms the different levels of examination performance by gender and also indicates that females make greater progress relative to their initial ability. Girls apply themselves better to homework and study and have higher educational aspirations. Nevertheless, the report shows that girls tend to have a lower sense of control of their lives, to report higher stress levels and to have lower self-esteem. In response the Department has initiated a number of personal development programmes for both sexes to address self-esteem among lower ability pupils in order to integrate them more fully into the education process.</P>
    <P>The eight to 15 early school leavers initiative and the stay at school retention initiative target those pupils most at risk of early school leaving and educational failure. In this context, it is significant that boys are more likely than girls to leave school before the end of their second level education. These interventions, together with improved access to the junior certificate schools programme and leaving certificate applied programme, are part of the strategy to tackle low achievement and, in particular, low achievement by boys.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to my plans for a major new initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority for my Department. My objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in school. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified. To this end, I will be allocating 200 new teaching posts to primary schools shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this initiative is that earlier this year, all primary schools were invited to participate in a survey of educational disadvantage. The Educational Research Centre issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all schools together with guidance on its completion. The closing date <Col N="1723" /> for the return of the questionnaires was extended following representations from schools and others in this regard. The ERC and my Department provided clarification to schools in relation to particular aspects of the questionnaire where this was requested. In some cases, delay arose because it was also necessary to obtain clarification concerning data supplied by schools.</P>
    <P>The analysis by the ERC of the responses received is now nearing completion. The survey findings will identify those schools that have significant concentrations of pupils with background characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. I will allocate the 200 new teaching posts and make grant allocations to the schools identified as soon as the survey findings become available.</P>

      <P>An additional 1,000 teaching posts have been created at second level in the 2000-01 school year. A proportion of these posts were provided to facilitate the reduction from 19:1 to 18:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes.</P>
      <P>The actual pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced significantly in recent years. The creation of the additional posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has also reduced significantly in recent years. In the current school year the pupil-teacher ratio is 20.4:1. The retention of the posts arising from the demographic dividend for the current year will further reduce the PTR.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I am allocating an additional 200 teaching posts at primary level for the 2000-01 school year to specifically deal with disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness an additional 900 teaching posts will be created at primary level and 400 at second level. These additional posts will further reduce the PTR at both primary and second level over the period of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. I have extended the scheme to all primary schools with effect from September of this year. All primary schools, other than those in the 1978-79 scheme, are now entitled to grant assistance on an annual basis from my Department of £40 per pupil &ndash; £20 in respect of secretarial assistance and £20 in respect of caretaking assistance &ndash; with a minimum grant of £2,400 being payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. My Department is currently finalising a circular on this matter that will shortly issue to all schools. In addition, schools with 100 pupils or less will also shortly be receiving grant assistance in respect of the period from September to December of this year.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools have become entitled to an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the funding arrangements for post-primary schools includes provision for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaker <Col N="1725" /> services in schools. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, it is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>My recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to per capita grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the operation of the schemes can be improved, delays in processing applications in many cases arise where the administering body is awaiting further information from applicants or where applications have been accepted after the closing date for their receipt.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recognition of teachers in the primary sector in the context of the current shortage of primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teacher training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved through graduation from one of the <Col N="1727" /> recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, or by a primary teacher trained outside the State achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>In order to tackle the present temporary shortage of qualified primary school teachers, however, those who have a primary degree and the higher diploma in education are paid at the trained rate when teaching in a temporary capacity in primary schools, provided they have obtained a grade C at higher level Irish in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State are recognised to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification. Such teachers may also be granted provisional recognition to teach in mainstream schools and classes for a period of five years pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>In addition, persons who hold a primary degree may apply for admission to a post graduate training course in the colleges of education. Such courses are provided from time to time when it is deemed necessary to increase the supply of qualified primary teachers. The courses last for 18 months and enable graduates to become fully qualified to teach in primary schools.</P>

      <P>The process of assessing the need for educational facilities at primary or second level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present concentrating on the areas of major development and population growth, with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional educational facilities exists, or is likely to arise in the future. As part of this process, officials of the planning and building unit consult regularly with local authorities with regard to development proposals and their implications. Liaison with existing schools is important, also, and these would usually alert my Department where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</P>
      <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or second level educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. Temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, since this Government came into office, there have been very substantial increases in the levels of capital funding for school accommodation. The table below illustrates the vast increase in the level of funding for school accommodation since 1997. As a result, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of educational infrastructure at both first and second level.</P>

      <P>My Department provides free primary education for all children from the age of four years. Most children in Ireland attend primary school from the September following their fourth birthday. Thus, what is commonly regarded as pre-school education in other European countries, that is, education for children aged four and five years, is regarded as primary education in Ireland, and is provided free for all children. In addition to the provision of infant classes in national schools, my Department also provides support for a range of initiatives aimed at children who are disadvantaged and children who have special needs.</P>
      <P>Pre-school provision for the coming school year, in addition to infants classes in primary schools, will be as follows: early start pre-school pilot programme, catering for a maximum of 1,680 children; Rutland Street pre-school project, currently catering for 84 children; 52 pre-schools for travellers catering for up to 520 Traveller children; pilot pre-school provision for autistic children, catering at present for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 644 pre-school children avail of all-day child care under the childcare measure provided by the vocational education committees to support access of unemployed and early school leaver parents to VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller programmes.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a blueprint for the development of early education, with the aim of building on existing provision and assisting providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs &ndash; are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
      <P>More generally, the White Paper also sets out a range of proposals designed to assist providers. These include the development of a quality in education mark to be awarded to providers who meet defined standards concerning matters such as curriculum and staff training. Supports will also be developed in a number of other areas including the production of materials and developmentally appropriate guidelines; research, development and dissemination of best practice; the provision of an advice, evaluation and inspection service; the development of a framework for qualifications and the provision of incentives for schools to make suitable premises available for pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. Detailed implementation of the White Paper proposals will be undertaken following the completion of the planning process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The ASTI claim was for the immediate payment of a 30% increase in the pay and allowances of ASTI members. The claim by the ASTI was processed in the normal way through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers. When agreement could not be reached the claim was submitted to the arbitration board as provided for in the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme. The Arbitration Board issued its findings on 25 September 2000. The board found that the claim should not be allowed but rather that, as in the case of teachers represented by other teacher unions, adjustments in pay be made on the basis of Annex II to Framework I of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I have accepted the findings and my Department is now in the process of implementing the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for all teachers. As acceptance of the PPF automatically triggers payment of a special payment of 3% under the so-called &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo; agreement to teachers with effect from 1 October 2000, I am also authorising that this payment be made to ASTI members in common with their teacher colleagues in other unions.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of the application of PPF and &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo; agreement will be that teachers' salaries will be increased by 8.5% from 1 October 2000 and with further increases of 5.5% and 4% to follow with effect from 1 October 2001 and 1 October 2002 respectively. These are significant increases in pay and, when taken together with the tax concessions under the PPF, will have a major impact on teachers' incomes.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the aspirations of the ASTI members have not been fully met. However, I have consistently made it clear to the ASTI and the other teacher unions at every opportunity that the only way forward is through the PPF. Once again I must emphasise the opportunities which the benchmarking mechanism, as set out in the PPF, provides for teachers to have their case independently evaluated by reference to both public and private sector comparable groups. The benchmarking body has already been established and has been asked to report before the end of June 2002. I urge the ASTI to pursue its aspirations for a fundamental review of the role and pay of teachers through the public service benchmarking body as is being done by other unions.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recent Higher Education Authority report which pointed to the ongoing low participation rates at third level of students from areas of disadvantage; the measures he will take on foot of this report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21490/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the, as yet unpublished, Higher Education Authority report on the 1997-98 academic year, which provides statistical data on the socio-economic background of full-time students in the university sector.</P>
      <P>The data in this report relate only to those third level institutions under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority and not to the third level sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I was pleased to formally launch Professor Pat Clancy's report on the social background of higher education entrants at the Higher Education Authority forum on equity in higher education. His report relates to new entrants to higher education in autumn 1998 and provides a comprehensive profile on the social background of entrants to the entire third level sector.</P>
      <P>His report shows that there has been a significant improvement in the proportion of persons coming from the two lowest socio-economic groups entering higher education as follows: in 1980, only 3% of persons coming from the unskilled manual workers group entered higher education. This increased to 12% in 1992 and 22% in 1998. In 1980, only 9% of persons coming from the semi-skilled manual workers group entered higher education. This has increased to 19% in 1992 and 23% in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> The report finds that the highest proportionate increase has occurred for those social groups which had very low participation rates in 1980 but that there are still six of the 11 social groups where less that 40% of the relevant population enter higher education.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups &ndash; students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I have increased the provision for the student assistance-access fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education under the programme for prosperity and fairness with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students in third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three disadvantaged groups, students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature, second chance students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy schoolbags and in particular the extent of the problem the factors which contribute to the problem and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that have implications not only for my Department but also for schools, parents and publishers.</P>
      <P>My Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledges that many factors contribute to the problem and it therefore follows that any solution requires action not just from my Department and school authorities but also from parents, publishers of educational books and from students themselves.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department's campaign was a success in bringing about a heightened awareness of the potential problem of heavy schoolbags among all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Positive action has been taken by many schools. At second level, actions taken by some schools consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P>

      <P>The interim reports on the urban and rural dimensions of the Breaking the Cycle project are the subject of ongoing consideration in my Department. However, I can advise the Deputy that a summary of the urban report has been issued to the relevant schools in a recent newsletter. A similar briefing on the interim evaluation of the rural dimension of the project by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra will issue to all the teachers in the 122 rural schools very shortly. Copies of the full interim reports are being made available to interested parties.</P>
      <P>Breaking the Cycle is a five year project spanning the period from 1 September 1996 until 30 June 2001. The evaluation of aspects of it will continue until this latter date. A salient feature of the project in urban schools is a significant reduction to 15:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; in the schools. A significant feature of the project in rural schools is the provision of a local co-ordinator in each of 25 clusters of schools to promote parental involvement, support school staffs and give direct support to pupils who are at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Both dimensions of the project provide for funding for books, learning materials and local initiatives. It is also required that schools engage in planning, in-career development and the evaluative process.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that the final report from the Educational Research Centre will be forwarded to my Department at the end of 2001. When that report has been considered fully, decisions will be made regarding the future of the programme.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the <Col N="1735" /> terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
    <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
    <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Each year, second level schools and vocational education committees furnish to my Department general details of the numbers of necessitous pupils assisted in the previous school year. Based on these returns the grant is paid by my Department to the individual schools/VECs. Consequently, the most recent year for which details of needy pupil numbers are available in my Department is 1999. Returns from schools/VECs indicate that approximately 146,000 needy second level pupils availed of the scheme during that year.</P>
    <P>At second level, in 1999 a total of £4,463,000 was allocated in aid towards the cost of school books for needy pupils. The provision for 2000 is £4,552,000.</P>
    <P>At primary level, in 1999 a total of £2,555,000 was provided towards the cost of school books for needy pupils. The provision for 2000 is £2,637,000 and it is estimated that approximately 150,000 needy pupils in 2,900 primary schools will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I share his concern about non-school attendance caused by whatever reason. Due to the link between non-school attendance and early school leaving, my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. In the course of preparing this legislation, I consulted with all relevant ministerial colleagues, including the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support through locally-based educational welfare officers to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides measures designed specifically with early school leavers in mind. Section 29 provides that a young person (in effect in most cases 16 and 17 year olds) may register with the National Educational Welfare Board if they leave school before their 18th birthday. The board will then, following consultation with the young person, parents and others prepare a plan for the young person's continuing education and training. Once that is done, the board will issue a cer<Col N="1738" /> tificate to the young person concerned. The section goes on to provide that an employer cannot employ a young person unless he or she is the holder of a valid certificate. An employer is also obliged to inform the board within a month after a young person has been employed. The provisions do not prevent young people taking up employment but seek to ensure that a balance is struck between their employment rights and their future educational, training and social needs. My Department is in the process of implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, precludes young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who are still at school, from working after 10 p.m. on any night when there is school the following day. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has recently recruited an additional seven inspectors to assist with the enforcement of this legislation.</P>
    <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. For that reason I believe that it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving with a view to the integration of such models after structured evaluation into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. Funding of £2.82 million has been allocated to this initiative for 2000.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    <P>Preventing early school leaving is not a simple matter and, to have a real chance of success, the solutions must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report of the National Social Work Qualifications Board of July 2000 which provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland based on a survey of the position at 1 September 1999. The survey found there were not enough qualified social workers available to fill posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required to meet future demand.</P>
      <P>The intake to the relevant courses in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin was increased by 20 students in October 1995. This increased intake has been maintained and a bachelor of social work degree was introduced by the National University of Ireland, Cork, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year with an intake of 18 students.</P>
      <P>The report outlines how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Quality practice placements are at the core of social work training and constitute some 50% of course time. The report notes that there is a crisis in the supply of practice placements due to a lack of formalised structures and resources. This situation is a major obstacle to colleges' abilities to increase student numbers. The National Social Work Qualifications Board has identified the resolution of the practice placement issue as a priority.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have had preliminary discussions with the Higher Education Authority in relation to the provision of additional places. However, as noted in the report, any initiatives that could be taken in this regard are dependent on the practice placement issue being resolved. I understand that officials of the Department of Health and Children are currently pursuing this issue in association with the National Social Work Qualifications Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress <Col N="1740" /> on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil can be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school or, alternatively, his-her placement in another school. In more difficult situations, the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils to determine the nature and extent of any special needs, with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>I have brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address generally issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a country-wide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools. The Act will require schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is involved in a consultative process with the partners in education with a view to establishing an appeals mechanism under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998. The establishment of appeals committees under section 29 of the Education Act is a significant step in ensuring an appropriate balancing of rights in the difficult area of suspension and expulsion.</P>

      <P>In addition to the financial assistance available under the maintenance grant schemes for further and higher education, students with disabilities attending courses in third level colleges and post-leaving certificate centres, may apply for assistance from the special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department. The purpose of the fund is to provide grant assistance to students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>Application forms and information notes for support under the 2000 fund (covering the 2000-01 academic year) were issued to the third level institutions and to the vocational education committees in respect of post leaving certificate centres on 20 September. The disability student services officer in the third level institutions, and the principal in the case of post-leaving certificate centres are asked to distribute application forms/notes to all students with disabilities in their college/school. Completed application forms for the 2000 fund are due for return to my Department on or before 20 October.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, a committee will assess each individual application and make awards accordingly. In 1999 the committee comprised officials from my Department, a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, and a representative from the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated to the special fund in 1994, its year of establishment, was £80,000. In 1999 the allocation was increased to £700,000 and I recently announced an increase in the provision for this year to £1 million.</P>
      <P>In 1999 funding was allocated to a total of 314 individual applicants and two group transport schemes. In view of the timing factors outlined above, it is not possible at this stage to say how many students will avail of the scheme in 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the fund for students with disabilities, most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote equality of opportunity, including access for students with disabilities, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. The 1999 allocation for Higher Education Authority funded targeted initiatives in the university sector, relating to students with disabilities was £539,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the national development plan, 2000-2006, provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million to build on the existing arrangements to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term <Col N="1744" /> employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>On 14 September 2000 I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education.</P>

      <P>Voluntary contributions by parents, or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme, are permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. Accordingly, there can be no compulsory levy on parents of children attending any school nor can any child be refused admission because of the non-payment of a voluntary contribution by his or her parents.</P>
      <P>The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school principals and managements. However, the manner of their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. It is important that students are not discriminated against by virtue of their parents not making any contribution.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, notwithstanding any voluntary contributions sought or local fundraising undertaken, my Department makes an additional payment of £30 per pupil to schools that are designated as disadvantaged and such schools also qualify for additional teaching resources.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to a fair funding regime for schools and in that context will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <P>Guidance, in both schools and other settings, is a vital contributor in enhancing the benefits of education to participants and, in doing so, to contributing to the economic and social well being of the country. Guidance has been a formal feature to the second level school system for more than 30 years and schools have been given the resources to provide guidance for their pupils.</P>
      <P>All schools in the free education scheme qualify for an ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance. The allocation to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school. It varies between 44 hours per week in the case of school with an enrolment of 1,000 or more pupils to eight hours per week in the case of a school with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils.</P>
      <P>Guidance, in addition to being a specialist area in education, is also a whole school activity which is incorporated in school development planning. This means that, in order to meet the guidance needs of the school, school management consults not only with the guidance counsellor but also with other members of the school community &ndash; staff, parents and pupils &ndash; on how best an integrated approach to meeting these needs may be formulated. This ensures that the objectives of the schools' guidance programme is aligned with and complements the school's overall programme and ethos. The question of increasing the allocation to schools in respect of guidance will be kept under review in the context of available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach used in the Combat Poverty Agency's demonstration programme &ndash; an inter-agency approach which brought together a consortium of interests whose collective expertise can address the needs of the target group in an integrated way correlates very closely with my own policies and approach to tackling educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that education can be a powerful force in promoting the opportunity for every person to develop to his or her full potential. There are strong links between poor educational achievement and leaving school without certification on the one hand and subsequent unemployment or under-employment on the other. Consequently, targeting supports at young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and <Col N="1746" /> early school leaving is now a priority issue for the Government and my Department.</P>
    <P>The key principles underlying my Department's approach to countering educational disadvantage are: targeting &ndash; resources should be targeted at those most in need; flexibility &ndash; different levels of need should be recognised in both the level of resourcing and the specific programmes implemented; planning &ndash; interventions should be planned properly before implementation and this should involve the setting of clear objectives and collective participation; accountability &ndash; there must be independent evaluation of the impact of initiatives; promoting success &ndash; the identification and dissemination of models of best practice should be implemented at all levels and support &ndash; structures and resources should be put in place to help those implementing initiatives on the ground.</P>
    <P>My Department, in supporting these principles, has put in place a wide range of measures to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels of the system. These include the home-school-community liaison scheme, the new programme at primary level shortly to be put in place that will incorporate the Breaking the Cycle project and the disadvantaged areas schemes, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, the &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; retention initiative, SSRI, at second level, second chance programmes through Youthreach, VTOS and senior Traveller training centres, adult literacy programmes, third level access programmes and youth services. Legislative underpinning for this work is provided by the Education Act, 1998, and the Education Welfare Act, 2000. Both the SSRI and the ESLI place particular emphasis on the inter-agency integrated approach and the integrated delivery of the services of statutory and voluntary agencies to young people at risk and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. Both the Higher Education Authority and the council of directors of institutes of technology have commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake detailed studies on the issue of non-completion. The Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the institute. My Department is funding these studies which will consider a range of factors as to their effect on completion rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is currently developing an oracle based data system to store <Col N="1747" /> detailed student related data. From the current academic year, the Higher Education Authority designated institutions will be requested to submit detailed data records on their student populations to the HEA. It will then be possible to trace where students fail to progress to the next year of a course.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition.</P>
    <P>The study of attrition or non-completion rates is a complex one. There is no simple explanation and no one simple initiative that will address the issue. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards. While the outcome of the research being undertaken will influence future policy directions in this area, there is a range of initiatives in place to enhance student completion rates.</P>

      <P>The Government, since taking up office, has introduced a range of initiatives to significantly reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio has declined from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 20.4:1 in the 1999-2000 school year. The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the current year, together with the creation of an additional 200 posts primarily to tackle educational disadvantage, will help to further reduce the pupil teacher ratio in the 2000-01 school year. Furthermore, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to appoint an additional 900 primary teachers in the course of the next few years.</P>

      <P>The Government announced last week a decision in principle to establish a body to compensate those people who as children were victims of abuse in the care of institutions in which they were resident and in respect of which State bodies had regulatory or supervisory functions. The Government further decided that the definition of abuse to be used in that process would be as defined by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000. The Government noted that further issues concerning the establishment, funding and operation of a compensation body would be subject to further consideration and decision in the near future. Whether children who were involved in the testing of experimental vaccines would come under the terms of a compensation body will depend on the extent to which they could be said to have been in the care of bodies over which the State had regulating or supervisory functions. This matter will be considered further as part of the process of preparing detailed provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilot projects in operation under the auspices of my Department are as follows. The modern languages pilot project has been running in 5th and 6th classes in selected primary schools since September 1998. Initially it was scheduled as a two year project but is continuing in this school year. Approximately 280 primary schools are involved in the project. The languages being taught are French, German, Spanish and Italian. Project leaders provide a support service and in-career development to teachers and schools involved in the project. In addition, the NCCA has drawn up curriculum guidelines and is currently working on teacher guidelines. Institiúd Teangeolaíochta Éireann (ITE) is carrying out an independent evaluation of the project and it is expected that an initial report will be available this year. This report will provide valuable information, which will be used in determining the future direction of modern languages in primary schools.</P>
      <P>An initiative to aid the teaching of Spanish, Italian and Japanese at post-primary level was launched in the current academic year. Its purpose is to encourage more students to study these languages in the context of enabling more effective communication with people of other nations and the equipping of young Irish people to compete successfully in the widest possible range of job markets. The initiative is intended to complement the modern languages primary project.</P>
      <P>The support teacher project, which was formerly known as the teacher-counsellor project, was introduced in 1995. The project is being monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis and an evaluation report on the operation of the project was carried out by my Department's inspectorate in 1998. The report recommends revision of the project specification; a re-focusing of the work of the project and the appointment of a project co-ordinator. The revised specification is being implemented; the support teachers are participating in an in-career development programme and a project co-ordinator was appointed in January 2000 to work with support teachers and school staffs.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was introduced in autumn 1996 for a planned five-year period and will continue in the participating schools until the end of the current school year. My Department is closely monitoring the operation of the scheme and it is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. The future of the scheme as a model for addressing educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings will be considered in the light of the findings in the final evaluation report which is due at the end of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> The Early Start pre-school project has been evaluated. This evaluation and the Government White Paper on Early Childhood Education will be taken into account when considering the future direction of the project.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative, which was introduced in September 1998, is to test models of an integrated services response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to identifying effective approaches to the problem, which could be replicated across the education system. This initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and involves 17 specific projects in 14 project areas. I have decided to continue support for the existing 17 projects for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. This initiative is being evaluated by the children's research centre, Trinity College, and the final evaluation report is expected in November 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department supports the refugee language support unit, RSLU, based in Trinity College, Dublin. This unit was established in March 1999 and continues for a two-year pilot phase after which its operation will be reviewed. The unit delivers, co-ordinates, and monitors the provision of English tuition for adult refugees, is establishing benchmarks for English language proficiency of both refugee adults and children and is preparing resource materials for the teaching of English to non-national children and adults. The unit also provides training for teachers providing language tuition to refugees.</P>
    <P>The discovering women in history project was commissioned by the equality committee of my Department. A group of history teachers is preparing a module on women in history and guidelines on primary research in history, for transition year and senior cycle students. A CD-ROM is being prepared and a website is being developed as part of the project. The materials which will be contained in the CD-ROM are being piloted in ten schools. It is proposed to launch the project in March 2001.</P>
    <P>The first of a proposed series of pilot courses &ndash; women into educational management &ndash; will take place in November 2000. The aims of the pilot courses are to explore the current context for women in educational management; to demystify, redefine and develop management and leadership skills and strategies, and to articulate and sustain a personal vision of leadership in education. The courses are targeted at women teachers who are interested and-or involved in administration in their schools and have been teaching for at least ten years. This initiative is part of an EU international project on women in educational management, IPWEM, which is funded under the SOCRATES programme.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently funding the CABAS, applied behaviour analysis project on a five year pilot basis. This project is delivering an applied behaviour analysis, ABA, model of <Col N="1751" /> response to 12 children with autism. This project will be evaluated at the end of the pilot period to establish the effectiveness of the ABA approach in addressing the educational needs of children with autism.</P>
    <P>A pilot project has been established to examine the feasibility of providing an increased range of vocational subject groupings, VSGs, within the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP. In March 2000, schools, which were already offering the LCVP, were invited to apply to participate in the pilot project during the school years 2000-01 and 2001-02. Applicant schools were required to develop and submit suitable programme plans, to provide a sound rationale for the selection of the new VSGs and to demonstrate a high level of commitment to curriculum development. Twenty nine schools were selected and took part in an induction day in May 2000. The LCVP support service will monitor the schools during the project and produce a final evaluation.</P>
    <P>A two year pilot project is under way in 132 second level schools as part of the school development planning initiative. The pilot project commenced in 1998. Its purpose is to develop and finalise guidelines for school development planning in second level schools.</P>
    <P>A pilot adult guidance service is currently being developed by a representative working group that was established by the National Centre for Guidance in Education. Some projects have already been selected and commenced in January of this year. The service is being piloted in urban and rural settings and covers a selection of programmes in the adult literacy, VTOS and adult and community education fields. It is intended that there will be expansion to further areas in 2001 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The school guidance review pilot project was launched in September 1999 to test a methodology and materials for reviewing schools' guidance programmes in post-primary schools. The methodology and materials were developed by an advisory group convened by the National Centre for Guidance in Education. The project was evaluated at the end of May 2000. The group is to make recommendations for mainstreaming to the Department shortly. This project compliments my Department's school development planning initiative.</P>
    <P>An employee assistance scheme for teachers was established on a pilot basis in 1998. A review of the scheme has been carried out and, following consultation with the relevant parties, it has been decided to extend the scheme on an interim basis for a further two years.</P>
    <P>Since autumn 1996, the Department has operated a voluntary scheme for the early retirement of teachers. Since 1997, the first full year of operation of the scheme, the scheme has operated on an annual basis. About 160 teachers per year have retired under the scheme since 1997. The scheme is a pilot scheme and is subject to review <Col N="1752" /> in the light of the Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. It is expected that the commission will report later this year.</P>
    <P>A pilot project is under way to determine the most effective type of dust extraction equipment for materials technology rooms. Consultants were engaged to advise on the relative merits of either central or integral dust extraction systems. The final report has just been received and is currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>A pilot project is being undertaken with a view to the development of a template for the design of standalone PE halls. This template will be tested in four schools initially. The project has just commenced.</P>
    <P>My Department is participating in the Government's pilot programme of public-private partnership, PPP, projects. The programme aims to test life cycle value for money from a PPP approach to procuring infrastructure. Five new post-primary schools &ndash; Clones, Tubbercurry, Ballincollig, Shannon and Dunmanway &ndash; together with the Cork School of Music and the proposed national maritime college are included in the programme.</P>
    <P>Term time working was introduced on a pilot basis for staff of this Department during last summer. My Department will be carrying out an evaluation of the operation of the pilot scheme in consultation with staff interests. A total of 19 members of staff availed of the provisions of the scheme this year.</P>

      <P>The judgment to which the Deputy refers, runs to 69 pages and three appendices of over 100 pages. It deals with a range of complex issues and has very significant implications, not just for the education of children with special needs but more generally for the education system. The full implications of the judgment are currently being studied in my Department and the House will appreciate that I am therefore somewhat constrained in commenting on this specific case.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 my Department formally recognised the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Arising from this decision, children with autism are catered for in special dedicated classes in special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. Each special class operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has the support of a special needs assistant. To date, a total of 63 special classes have been established to cater specifically for children with autism and further classes are being established on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with milder forms of autism may be capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis. In such cases, the children in question are supported by the resource teacher service and by special needs assistants. Over the past two years, the number of resource teachers catering for children with special needs in primary schools, including children with autism, has been increased from 104 to more than 560. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from 200 to more than 1,400 over the same period. These developments represent an unprecedented level of growth in support services for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>However, the case referred to by the Deputy has highlighted inadequacies in the provision made by the State for the education of children with special needs. I have already indicated that I want to give a priority to improvements in provision for special needs pupils. I have already established a special task force on autism which has been requested to report to me within three months. The report from the task force on autism, will provide a basis for the development of an appropriate response by the State to the needs of children with autism for the future. In the interim I have asked my Department to explore what other more immediate improvements might be made in education services for children with autism.</P>

      <P>The need for outreach centres will be considered in the light of my plans to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions.</P>
      <P>I have had top level discussions with representatives of the Church, local authorities and elected representatives in Wexford and Kilkenny, as well as senior staff from the Institute of Technology, Carlow and NUI, Maynooth, in relation to plans being developed in these areas.</P>

      <P>There are currently 5,000 approved places for the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. Until now, this figure has met the overall demand on a national level, but in a number of locations demands are emerging for the provision of additional places. At this stage all 5,000 places for the academic year 2000-01 have been allocated, and unfilled places in other centres have been redeployed to meet emerging needs. My Department is currently examining the revised uptake for 2000-01 in all 33 vocational education committees at the beginning of October to see whether a further re-distribution is feasible. Initial feedback is that demand is high.</P>
      <P>The back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education, <i>Learning for Life</i>, proposes to expand VTOS, Youthreach, PLC and senior Traveller training programmes on a part-time basis. The intention is that this initiative will address the increase in demand for places, and provide flexibility in provision of programmes to meet the demands of adults wishing to return to education and training. A working group is at present finalising the details for administration of the initiative so that it will become operational by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices under the standards based apprenticeship system which was agreed by all relevant groups was set out in a letter from my Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The arrangements clearly stated that assessment for <Col N="1756" /> phase four would consist of two occasions of testing and that a terminal examination would only apply at the end of phase six of the apprenticeship system. This latter would be the only situation in which payment for an examination as part of the apprenticeship system would be made.</P>
      <P>In August 1999 it was brought to the attention of my Department that certain of the institutes of technology were conducting both occasions of phase four testing at the end of phase four. My Department subsequently issued circular letter No. IT 9/99 on the assessment regulations governing phase four procedures reiterating the position as set out in 1995. All directors of institutes of technology and the president of Dublin Institute of Technology were directed to ensure that the sanctioned arrangements would be complied with.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this direction, the Department has been advised that in latter months certain phase four assessment results have been withheld by staff in the institutes, who are TUI members, who are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing. Efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Institution of Engineers of Ireland, IEI, published a discussion paper entitled &ldquo;A Review of our Engineering Manpower Shortages at Degree and Technician Levels&rdquo; in March 2000. This paper was subsequently considered by the expert group on future skills needs which concluded that the concerns of the IEI in relation to engineering manpower, other than in the area of civil engineering, had been addressed through the group's work.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the demand for civil engineers, the IEI paper highlights the increase in demand that will arise in the implementation of the infrastructural developments set out in national development plan and the unprecedented level of activity in the Irish construction industry. The expert group on future skills needs has established a specialist sub-group to address the skills needs in the construction sector and the civil engineers will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>I have also met the IEI to discuss skills needs in the engineering sector. Arising out of these discussions, my Department is co-operating with the IEI on an initiative to promote engineering as a career and to attract more young people into the profession.</P>

      <Quest> if a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 is entitled to participate in community employment in view of the fact that she is not in receipt of a social welfare payment but is receiving an equivalent level of maintenance payment from her estranged husband and she is available for work; and if she will make a statement on the policy in respect of persons in this situation gaining access to community employment. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The community employment CE programme, is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. Eligibility for CE is confined to persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows/widowers pension for a minimum of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>On the basis outlined the person referred to is not eligible for CE. The present eligibility criteria for the programme were drawn up after a full review of CE was undertaken and in consultation with the social partners, and are designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of society. CE is a very popular programme and limited resources do not make it possible to provide places for all unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>I note from the Deputy's question that this person is available for work and in this regard I am happy to advise that FÁS, in the context of the current very favourable employment climate, provides a range of training courses aimed at people who wish to acquire new skills or update old skills. Past experience has shown that training provides better opportunities for unemployed persons to progress to open labour market employment. Details of such training courses are available from local employment services offices.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I have made 215 appointments to bodies, boards or organisations under the aegis of my Department. Eleven of these appointments were on a full-time basis and 88 operate on a <i>per diem</i> basis. The board members of FÁS, Forfas, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, National Standards Authority of Ireland, Health and Safety Authority, NET, FÁS International operate in a part-time capacity and are paid an annual fee.</P>
      <P>Rights Commissioners and the Chairperson, vice-chairperson and members of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are paid a daily fee for their services. The chairperson, vice-chairperson and members of the Labour Court are employed in a full-time capacity and are paid an annual salary. Appointments to the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation are part-time and the chairman only receives an agreed fee. Appendix A lists all appointees to individual organisations during the period concerned, and any fees paid.</P>
      <P>For all appointees, travelling expenses and subsistence allowances are payable in respect of journeys undertaken to attend meetings or to transact relevant business.</P>
      <P>Appendix B shows the structure of the organisations concerned and the origin of nominations.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to change the current procedures which I believe have contributed to the appointment of very high calibre personnel providing valuable public service.</P>

      <Quest> if she has yet arrived at a determination on the retention or discontinuation of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987; and her views on the arguments by a person (details supplied) that the abolition of the order will seriously damage smaller retailers and family owned businesses. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Groceries Order, 1987 was one of 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of Competition and Mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law, including the groceries order, and the administration of mergers law in the report of the competition and mergers review group which I published last May.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the Groceries Order, the majority of the review group recommended that: the groceries order be repealed; any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; some form of regulation be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would in particular require suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, would require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, would ban &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, and would require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products which they sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am considering this recommendation and will <Col N="1771" /> make a decision on it as soon as possible. In making that decision I will take all the representations I have received into account.</P>

    <P>A large number of the appointments which fall to be made by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to bodies such as port companies and fisheries boards require a nomination process from a range of statutory and representative organisations. In so far as ministerial appointments are concerned, these are made by reference to the needs of the body concerned and the skills-experience of potential nominees.</P>

      <P>Under the Agreement, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference brings together the Irish and British Governments &ldquo;to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments&rdquo;. In particular, it enables the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals on non-devolved Northern Ireland matters, including in the areas of policing, rights and justice issues. It was established when the British-<Col N="1778" /> Irish Agreement entered into force on 2 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The work of the conference is supported by a joint secretariat in Belfast, comprising Irish and British officials, and regular meetings and exchanges of information and views take place at official level.</P>
      <P>The inaugural summit level meeting of the conference took place in London on 17 December 1999. No date has yet been set for the next meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is opposed to the US economic embargo imposed against Cuba. We are joined in this opposition by our European Union partners. We want to see this embargo end. We have consistently expressed our view in this regard to the US Government and we have regularly supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that there has been some recent progress on this matter. Following developments during the summer in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, Senate and House leaders on 5 October agreed provisions <Col N="1779" /> lifting restrictions on the sale of food and medicines to Cuba. If these measures are approved by formal vote, they will represent a significant partial step towards lifting the embargo.</P>
    <P>EU policy towards Cuba is defined by the common position adopted in December 1996. The aim of the common position is not to enforce by external coercion of any kind but to encourage a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people. While opposed to such isolating measures as the economic embargo, the common position nevertheless is obliged to make clear that wholehearted EU co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the absence of fundamental human and political rights.</P>
    <P>The common position is subject to six-monthly review and was reconfirmed at the General Affairs Council on 8 June last. This followed a careful evaluation of the situation in Cuba over the previous six months which led to the inescapable conclusion that there had been no substantive change as regards basic political and human rights, and there appeared to be no early prospect of evolution towards pluralistic democracy. Nevertheless, it was agreed that the Union should deploy further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue in the political, economic and human rights spheres.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that at its most recent session in March/April 2000, the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted, with EU support, a resolution criticising Cuba's human rights performance, and calling on it to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN. The EU, in a comment on the resolution, also expressed continuing concern about the impact on Cuba of the economic embargo. Following the adoption of the resolution, Cuba withdrew an invitation to a European Union Troika at Deputy Foreign Minister level, which was due to visit Havana at the end of April. Cuba also withdrew its application to join the new ACP Convention.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Ireland and its EU partners continue to believe that confidence-building <Col N="1780" /> measures should be pursued with Cuba in the spirit of the common position.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the current moves in the US Congress to modify at least the food and medicine elements of the economic embargo as a helpful and positive step, pending a complete and definitive lifting of the embargo as a whole.</P>

A total of £704,000 has been spent on rehabilitation assistance and emergency assistance programmes to date, however, it is anticipated that Ireland Aid will spend a total of £1000,000 on rehabilitation assistance in central America this year, in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>A total of £1,053,326 has been allocated to NGOs under the co-financing and block grant schemes in 2000 for projects in the region and £425,001 has been committed to NGOs for projects under the human rights and democratisation budget 2000. In addition, funding of £100,000, £50,000 in 1999 and £50,000 in 2000, was provided to the United Nations Volunteers in support for the Ombudsman's Office, Peru.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the political and economic importance of the Latin American region continues to grow, the focus of our policy toward central and southern America is to build closer bilateral relations with the countries of the region, and together with our partners in the European Union to forge a closer bi-regional relationship with Latin America as a whole.</P>
      <P>The bi-regional relationship between the European Union and Latin America was given a new impetus by the success of the inaugural summit of heads of State and Government between the EU and the Latin America and the Caribbean, at Rio de Janeiro in June 1999. This summit agreed a declaration and action plan to establish a new strategic relationship between the two regions, based on compliance with international law, the strengthening of democracy and individual freedom and highlighting the universality of all human rights. This was later endorsed at the ministerial meetings between the EU and the countries of central and south America in Vilamoura, Portugal in February 2000, which reaffirmed the commitment to carry forward a broad range of priority actions in the political, economic, social, environmental, educational, cultural, technical and scientific spheres.</P>
      <P>The increasing importance of the Latin American region is reflected in the strengthening of our bilateral relations with individual countries. In October 1999, an Irish Embassy was opened in Mexico city, with secondary accreditation to Colombia, Cuba, Peru and Venezuela. This is in addition to the long-standing mission in Buenos Aires, which also holds accreditation for Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay. This increase in diplomatic coverage will facilitate the development of closer bilateral relations with these countries.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, as part of the process of broadening our relations with the Americas, Ireland applied for and was granted observer status at the Organisation of American States. This step, which formalises Ireland's relationship with the OAS, will facilitate the development of closer political and economic links with the member states of this key regional organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>There are two Irish Embassies in central and south America, one in Mexico city and the other in Buenos Aires. The staffing complement for Mexico is three diplomatic officers and four locally recruited staff and for Buenos Aires two diplomatic officers and four locally recruited staff. In addition, Ireland has Honorary Consulates in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guyana, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.</P>
      <P>I am keeping under continuous review the need to establish further Irish Embassies abroad and one of the Government's priority areas is central and South America. In this context, the Government is engaged in a review of our strategy towards central and south America and further resident diplomatic representation will be considered within that framework.</P>

      <P>On 31 July last, I announced that the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Tosco Corporation had signed non-binding heads of agreement for the sale of the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy Island oil terminal. The National Oil Reserves Agency is not included in the terms of the sale.</P>
      <P>In the interim, both principals have been working to move the initiative forward to a successful conclusion, and I understand that this ongoing process is currently on schedule. My Department and the Department of Finance, with the assistance of external consultants, continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that shareholder concerns are adequately addressed as the negotiations proceed.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Government's decision of 23 February 1999 which initiated the current process, the search for proposals and the assessment of submissions was a matter in the first instance for INPC. No particular type of proposal was ruled out by the Government decision, nor was there a preference expressed for one kind of solution rather than another. Following an extensive search which was carried out by the company on that basis, four definite proposals were submitted to the INPC. In the event, the INPC board recommended the submission received from the Tosco Corporation. That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the consultants who are advising me on the proposed deal, which involves a commitment by a major oil company to operate the facilities in question for a minimum of 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> In these circumstances, I authorised INPC to enter into a period of exclusive negotiations with the Tosco Corporation on the basis that this proposal represents the option most likely to contribute to the attainment of national objectives on security and continuity of supply at least cost to consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member state of the EU and the International Energy Agency, Ireland is obliged to maintain, at minimum, a 90 day emergency oil reserve. The following table shows, in each of the three product categories specified under EU legislation, the number of days represented by stocks owned by, or held on behalf of, the National Oil Reserves Agency, either here in Ireland or at locations abroad.</P>
      <P>The International Energy Agency has detailed procedures in place which set out the circumstances in which member states including Ireland would release emergency stocks as part of an overall response to a major international oil crisis. In Irish domestic legislation, I have power under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations, 1995 (SI No. 96 of 1995), in the event of a national or local emergency, to authorise the release of NORA stocks, even though this might result in a temporary infringement of the 90 day obligation.</P>
      <P>NORA stocks were last released in December 1999, in response to a shortage of home heating oil in the Munster area, due to exceptional demand coming up to Christmas and the new year, and the interruption of normal supply arrangements because of a prolonged period of bad weather at sea. Some element of consumer stockpiling, in the context of possible Y2K disruption, was also suggested at the time. On that occasion, NORA was authorised to make available up to 5,800 tonnes of kerosene to the oil companies, on the basis that the agency would replace these stocks as soon as possible. In the event only 3,500 tonnes were required to be released.</P>
      <P>NORA reserves are maintained to comply with binding international obligations. While the availability of these stocks provides a certain flexibility in dealing with temporary <i>force majeure </i>difficulties in our oil supply arrangements, this in no way detracts from the obligation on oil companies and major oil consumers to endeavour to maintain prudent stock levels at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the taxation of the carer's allowance issued by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments, including the carer's allowance, are reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the particular tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the carer's allowance, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the carer's allowance itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital acquisitions tax exempt threshold now applying on transfers between siblings is £30,000. This was increased from £25,720 in Budget 2000. As the Deputy will be aware, I also introduced other substantial changes to the CAT legislation in the budget. In addition to increasing the three tax-free thresholds for gifts and inheritances, I introduced a single CAT rate of 20% to replace the previous rates of 20%, 30% and 40%. I also introduced a dwellinghouse exemption whereby the transfer of a shared family home <Col N="1800" /> is exempt from CAT subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>These measures will reduce the CAT liability of all beneficiaries including siblings. The significant package of measures contained in Budget 2000 constitutes the biggest single easement in the structure of CAT since its introduction in 1976. When considering the increase in the three exempt thresholds in Budget 2000, I decided against further increases because of Exchequer costs. However, as I indicated during the discussions of the Finance Bill, 2000, the issue of CAT will be kept under review.</P>

However, the Deputy will be aware that in its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. To date, all pay increases have been passed on to pensioners on the basis of parity, including the special pay increase of 2% under the Partnership 2000 Agreement. The issue of pension increases generally is being considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions at present. The commission is expected to submit its report before the end of the year. I look forward to receiving its recommendations and I will be considering future pension increases in that context.</P>

      <P>Motor vehicle excise duty was abolished on 31 December 1992 under the EU Single Market rules. However, with effect from 1 January 1993, vehicle registration tax is payable on first registration of a vehicle in the State and applies to both new and second-hand cars brought in from EU member states or imported from third countries. In the case of personal purchases, vehicles must be declared for registration by the end of the next working day following arrival in the State and the tax must be accounted for at that time. In the case of authorised motor vehicle dealers, the registration requirement may be deferred until such time as the vehicle is sold.</P>

      <P>Mr. Donal Byrne reappointed as director to the Central Bank of Ireland on 15 September 2000.</P>
      <P>Candidates are considered on the basis of general suitability to the position of director. Every effort is made to ensure a range of economic sectors are represented on the board although clearly it has been the practice not to appoint anyone with links to a financial institution to avoid conflicts of interest.</P>
      <P>The following members were appointed to the Public Service Benchmarking Body on 19 July 2000: the Hon. Mr. Justice Quirke; Mr. Patrick Mullarkey; Ms Maureen Lynott; Mr. Jim O'Leary; Mr. Bill Attley; Mr. Phil Flynn and Mr. John Dunne.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the body are governed by the requirement in the public service pay agreement under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for the composition of the body to be agreed by the parties to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following outgoing members of the Arbitration Board for the Civil Service were reappointed on 7 July 2000: Mr. Gerard Durcan <Col N="1802" /> SC &ndash; Chair; Mr. Derek Hunter and Mr. Tom Wall.</P>
    <P>These appointments are subject to the terms of the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme which provide for the chairperson to be nominated by the Minister for Finance with the agreement of the staff side of the Civil Service general council, and for a member nominated by the general council staff panel and a Government nominee.</P>
    <P>I appointed Mr. Brian Hillery to the board of ICC Bank plc on 4 October 2000.</P>
    <P>Appointments to the board of ICC Bank plc are made by the Minister on the basis of general suitability. Due cognisance is taken of conflicts of interest. All proposed appointees to the boards of credit institutions, including ICC Bank plc, require the approval of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The number of appointments to bodies, boards or organisations under the aegis of my Department made by me since I took office is as follows:</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency has an advisory committee which advises the agency on various matters and is consulted by me on the terms, conditions and term of office of the chief executive. Advisory committee members are paid such fees and expenses as the agency, with my consent, may determine. The Secretary General of my Department is an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the committee and does not receive a fee. He was appointed to the committee in March of this year.</P>
      <P>There were four appointments made to the Valuation Tribunal. Appointments are part-time and remuneration is on the basis of fees payable for sittings of the tribunal. Subsistence and travelling expenses are also paid.</P>
      <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland was established in May 1998 and I appointed a principal officer in my Department as chairperson. He receives an allowance in addition to his salary as principal officer. I invited 20 organisations to nominate representatives to the board and asked two other individuals to serve on the board. Since then six organisations have replaced their original nominees. No payments are made to board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have renewed the appointment annually each April of the chairperson of the Civil Service Dis<Col N="1803" /> ciplinary Code Appeals Board. I have also renewed annually each January the mediator for the Civil Service grievance procedure. These are positions in respect of which a fee is paid.</P>
    <P>I have appointed three members to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal &ndash; one was a reappointment. The appointments were made following their nomination by the Minister for Health and Children. The members of this board are paid a fee.</P>
    <P>I made one appointment to the Board of the Revenue Commissioners. This is a full time position in respect of which a salary is paid.</P>
    <P>I have appointed eight directors to the Central Bank of Ireland &ndash; seven ordinary directors and one service director &ndash; of which three were reappointments. Only the governor holds a full-time paid position, the other directors receive an annual fee with the exception of the service director who does not receive any remuneration for his role as a director. They do not receive any further expenses.</P>
    <P>I have made seven appointments to the Public Service Benchmarking Body. They are not full time positions and members receive a fee. Expenses are also paid at the civil service rates where applicable.</P>
    <P>I have made two appointments to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector. They are not full time positions and members receive a fee. Expenses are also paid at the Civil Service rates where applicable.</P>
    <P>I have made four appointments to the Civil Service Arbitration Board and Adjudicator. They are not full-time positions and members receive a fee.</P>
    <P>I have made 11 appointments to the board of directors of ACC Bank plc. The directors receive a fee per annum. The director representing the Department of Finance receives no payment.</P>
    <P>The Trustees of TSB Bank and myself appointed a non-statutory board to oversee the merger of ACC Bank and TSB Bank on 1 April 1999. The non-statutory board was to become the board of the merged bank in due course. I made five appointments to this board. One of these was replaced following a resignation.</P>
    <P>I have made nine appointments to the board of directors of ICC Bank plc. The directors receive a fee per annum. The director representing the Department of Finance receives no payment.</P>
    <P>I have made seven appointments to An Post National Lottery Company, four were nominated by An Post and three were nominated by myself. The directors are paid a fee unless the person appointed holds a board or executive position with An Post. One of the board members receives travel and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>The issue of top level international appointments is being considered in the context of proposals for Oireachtas reform generally. As regards domestic appointments, I have no plans at present to introduce procedures for an independent system to examine and scrutinise <Col N="1804" /> appointments or nominations to domestic bodies or organisations under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>The above list of bodies under the aegis of my Department does not include international organisations where I have a role in relation to eventual appointments.</P>

      <P>The provision of school medical services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
      <P>As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report recommends a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools involving screening of children at ages five to six years, seven to eight years and 11-12 years. Such screening will include measurement of growth &ndash; height and weight &ndash; testing of visual acuity and of hearing and general observation. The report also recommends selective medical examination of children with problems and that children with special needs should receive particular attention.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the report is a matter for the health boards. The chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national conjoint child health committee and appointed national child health co-ordinators for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the recommendations of the report in the health boards. The co-ordinators have indicated that the North Western Health Board will pilot the new school health service programme in its region later this year and report the outcome of the evaluation to the co-ordinators. The pilot programme will commence later this year.</P>

      <P>Supplies of influenza vaccine are made available free of charge to family doctors for administration to both medical card and non-medical card patients. The question of a fee for the administration of this vaccine to those in the latter category is a matter between patients and their doctor. I have no plans at present to provide for influenza vaccination to be made available to private patients on the same basis as for medical card holders.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that, in line with the commitment in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, it was agreed in 1999 that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over would be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three-year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, were increased by one-third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a <Col N="1806" /> person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time my Department receives inquiries from persons about batch numbers of three-in-one vaccine administered in the past. However, as my Department does not hold individual immunisation records, persons with inquiries are advised to contact their health board which may hold such records. I have made inquiries of the health boards as to the number of persons who have recently sought such information. The responses received from the boards to date are as follows:</P>
      <P>Up to August 1998, 27 requests for information were received by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and in ten of these the batch number was available. A detailed search of all immunisation records would be required in order to ascertain if further requests have been received.</P>
      <P>In the Midland Health Board region one case is ongoing in which it has not been possible to trace the child's immunisation record or the vaccine batch number involved in this case.</P>
      <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board region approximately five persons are actively pursuing information.</P>
      <P>In the North-Eastern Health Board region two requests for information were received, one of which is being actively pursued. Despite extensive searches, lot or batch numbers have not been traced.</P>
      <P>In the North-Western Health Board region four requests for information were received in 1999 and the batch lot numbers could not be traced. There are no ongoing requests.</P>
      <P>There are no active inquiries in the South-Eastern Health Board region.</P>
      <P>There is one active request for information in the Southern Health Board region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> In the Western Health Board region ten requests for information were received, of which two involve ongoing correspondence.</P>
    <P>Persons with special needs are eligible for and are in receipt of a wide range of health and social services.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, in common with other vaccines and therapeutic substances, adverse reactions to three-in-one vaccine can occur. It has been considered in this country, as in all other countries using this vaccine, that the benefits to children far outweigh the potential risks and help to protect them from the serious consequences of a previously prevalent disease. The great majority of adverse reactions to vaccination are not serious and are temporary in nature. The identification and use of contraindications to particular vaccines helps further to reduce any potential risk.</P>

      <P>The Greater Dublin Water Supply Strategic Study published in 1996 estimates that about 92,000 properties in the greater Dublin area and 20,000 properties in Cork city have lead service pipes connecting the properties to the public water mains. Service pipes are normally the responsibility of the property owner. No breakdown is available for either <Col N="1816" /> location as between domestic and non-domestic properties.</P>
      <P>The 1998 EU Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) reduces the parametric value for lead from 50 micrograms per litre under the previous directive to ten micrograms per litre. A 15 year timeframe to the end of 2013 is specified for achieving compliance with the new standard with an interim value of 25 micrograms per litre to be achieved by the end of 2003. Compliance with the interim standard is generally achievable through appropriate treatment at water treatment plants. Limited sampling of houses in Dublin, known to have lead services, indicates that up to 80% may already be in compliance with the 2013 standard. Full assessment of the extent of the works required and the cost implications of meeting the new lead standard must, however, await determination of a recommended sampling method for lead. Proposals in this regard are awaited from the EU Commission.</P>

This figure subsumes some 470 of the approximately 800 new taxi licences proposed for issue by the Dublin local authorities between 1999 and 2001. The subsequent Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 3 of 2000) provide for the first phase of implementation of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>Judicial review proceedings were initiated in the High Court in February 2000 in relation to the Government decision and a range of provisions contained in public service vehicle regulations. The court has granted an interim injunction preventing Dublin Corporation from granting taxi licences pursuant to S.I. No. 3 of 2000 pending the determination of this application for judicial review.

      <Quest>the plans he has for funding the development of sports facilities in new housing estates where local authorities seek such funding and in existing estates where local resident associations seek such funding for the local authorities; if he will liaise with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure national lottery funding for such proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government Act, 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes. The criteria to be applied to the provision of public open space in housing schemes is a matter for each local authority in accordance with their development plan. When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Local authorities were advised in the new social housing design guidelines issued by my Department in September 1999 that they should consider ways to facilitate and encourage the pro<Col N="1818" /> vision of services and amenities including parks, playing fields and recreational and leisure facilities. Appropriate facilities of this kind are, on a limited basis, funded as part of the cost of a new housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations.</P>
    <P>Funding is also available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated rundown housing estates. The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but to improve the living conditions of the tenants. For this reason works of an environmental nature, including certain amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken to the dwellings.</P>
    <P>The disbursement of national lottery funding for sporting facilities is a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation with whom I would be happy to liaise on any specific proposal directly involving local authorities.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 42,462 people in receipt of a rent supplement. Of these, 988 people reside in <Col N="1822" /> County Kerry. At the end of December 1999 there were 41,873 rent supplements in payment of which 999 were in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>In 1999, total expenditure on rent supplements was approximately £101 million. Of this approximately £1.75 million relates to rent supplements in County Kerry. To date, expenditure in 2000 on rent supplements is approximately £89.6 million of which £1.41 million relates to County Kerry.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the escalating costs of fuel such as coal and oil; and if he will increase the free fuel allowance paid to old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients in view of these added costs.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's ser<Col N="1823" /> ies of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year. I am aware that an increase of almost 7.9% was recorded in the fuel and light component of the CPI in the 12 months up to last August. I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments implemented in the last three budgets. I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I wish to point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit since 26 March 1992. In the past five years the person has been referred for medical assessment on three different occasions. The certified cause of incapacity usually determines the date of the initial assessment. The frequency of subsequent assessments is normally based on the medical assessor's opinion. All medical evidence available is reviewed by the assessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> The person concerned was found to be capable of work following a medical assessment on 21 August 2000. A deciding officer disallowed payment of disability benefit from 29 August 2000. The person has appealed the decision and in this connection a further medical examination by a different medical assessor has been arranged for 24 October 2000. The person's entitlement to disability benefit will be reviewed in the light of the result of this examination and, if necessary her case will be referred to an appeals officer for decision. In the meantime the person is receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing entitlement to disability benefit require that adequate medical control is exercised. This control is exercised through the medical review system and in this regard a person may be referred for medical assessment from time to time during the period of their claim.</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the situation in relation to free schemes for a widow over 70 whose husband had the free schemes as he was over 75; if she qualifies while an adult daughter lives in the house; if he will have considerations made into changing the regulations in the coming budget and allow retention of the free schemes in cases such as this where the surviving spouse is over 66 or 70.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since June 1997 any person aged 75 or over in receipt of a qualifying pension payment is entitled to the free schemes regardless of income or household composition. From October 2000 this entitlement is extended to persons not in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>Widows or widowers under the age 66 are not entitled to the various free schemes, although those aged 60-65 may retain any free scheme entitlement of their late spouse provided they continue to meet the &ldquo;household composition&rdquo; conditions for eligibility. At age 66, they can qualify in their own right but subject also to satisfying the &ldquo;household composition&rdquo; conditions. This means that the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted categories of people. This would preclude entitlement in cases where there is another adult member in the household who is in full-time employment. In situations where the applicant is incapacitated and another member of the household is caring for them, that carer can work for up to ten hours per week and still be considered an excepted person.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has in mind a situation where the daughter who is residing in the household is engaged in full-time employment. In that event, the daughter could not be considered as an excepted person for the purposes of the free schemes under current rules, and the person concerned would not be entitled to these allowances as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> Proposals for changes in the free schemes conditions would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the increased payment of PRSI which would be necessary, if paid equally by employer and employee, to introduce an enhanced income continuance payment of, for example, £50 or £100 per week to surviving widows or widowers with dependent children; the cost to his Department to introduce such a scheme for existing qualified persons; if he will have considerations made into introducing such a self-financing scheme for widows while they have qualifying children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 8,574 recipients of widow/er's contributory pension with at least one qualifying child at the end of August 2000. The provision of an additional payment of £50 per week to such recipients would cost approximately £22.3 million per annum. If this additional payment were to be funded equally by increases in the rates of employee and employer PRSI, an increase of 0.09% in the main employee rate &ndash; 4.5% &ndash; would be required along with an increase of 0.05% in both the lower &ndash; 8.5% and standard &ndash; 12% &ndash; rates of employer PRSI. The cost of a similar payment at a rate of £100 per week would be £44.6 million per annum. This would require an increase of 0.18% in the main employee rate and increase of 0.11% in both the lower and standard rates of employer PRSI, if it were to be funded in the same manner.</P>
      <P>Any consideration of this issue would have to have regard to the situation of widowed persons with at least one qualified child in receipt of one-parent family payment. Entitlement to one-parent family payment is not based on payment of social insurance contributions. It is means-tested and funded directly by the Exchequer. Of the total of 70,000 receiving one-parent family payment who are caring for children, about 1,300 are widowed persons while the others are separated persons, unmarried persons and prisoners' spouses.</P>
      <P>Any increases in the rates of payments to widows and widowers can only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle and the Social Welfare Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act, 1990, <Col N="1827" /> and comprises 15 members including the chairperson. The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, relating to occupational pensions; and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to its functions and on matters relating to pensions generally.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that nine members of the board will be appointed by the Minister on the nomination(s) by organisations representing trades unions, employers and other organisations involved in the pensions industry. It also provides for one representative each from the Department of Finance and my Department. The remaining members are representative of the general interests of the community. Regard is also had to the Government policy for a minimum representation, 40% of men and women on State boards.</P>
    <P>No appointments have been made to the Pensions Board since 1 July 2000.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986. The main functions of the agency are to advise the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty.</P>
    <P>There are currently 16 board members. Ms Grace Maguire and Ms Margaret Sweeney were appointed to the board on 10 July 2000.</P>
    <P>Persons are selected for appointment to the board on the basis of their interest and commitment in the area of poverty and social inclusion. Regard is also had to the Government's policy on minimum representation, 40% of men and women on State boards.</P>
    <P>Comhairle was established on 12 June 2000 under the Comhairle Act, 2000, and comprises 20 members including a chairperson.</P>
    <P>It is responsible for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for citizens, including people with disabilities. This new organisation combines the National Social Service Board with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the board shall include five members representative of people with disabilities nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, an elected member of staff and a representative from my Department. The remaining members, 13, are representative of the following interests &ndash; health boards, local authorities, local development, citizens information centres, independent information providers and general interests.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides that the Minister, when making appointments to the board, shall have regard to the objective of having a minimum of eight men and eight women on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> No appointments have been made to the board of Comhairle since 1 July 2000.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 to deal with cases where entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is an independent agency. It is made up of a chairman and four ordinary members, two of whom are representative of workers and two representative of employers. The members are appointed by the Minister on foot of nominations by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business Employers' Confederation. No appointments have been made to the board of Comhairle since 1 July 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the level of compensation available to farmers, part of whose lands are no longer available for farming activities due to designation under the Habitats Directive and where such designation has rendered farming the remaining portion un-viable; her views on the fact that such a fall out from designation was never intended under the directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>From my earlier reply to a similar question on 29 June 2000, the Deputy will be aware that I have submitted a draft compensation scheme to the EU Commission for its agreement. Under this proposed scheme farmers will be compensated for actual losses which arise from the designation of their lands as SACs. This compensation scheme will apply to farmers who are not in the voluntary rural environment protection scheme, and who enter into a management agreement with Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to confirm that I do not anticipate that the habitats directive and designation of SACs will necessitate wholesale changes in farming practice with consequent losses in income. Indeed, the fact that these special areas have survived up to now is evidence that they are already being farmed and used in a manner compatible with their continued conservation and preservation.</P>

      <Quest>the plans she has to relocate items of local interest in storage at the National Museum to suitable accommodation for display in other cities and towns; the quantity of items and material held in storage which could be suitably decentralised; if specific named items could be relocated on request; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The museum's loan policy provides that original museum objects can only be loaned to museums and other venues which can meet acceptable standards of curatorship, security, environmental control, display and insurance. The loan of such objects is subject to the exhibition and research requirements within the museum and to the availability of resources to service loans.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Ireland already has substantial loans of artefacts in a number of locations throughout the country. At present for example, artefacts are held in county and city museums at Limerick, Cork, Tralee, Clonmel, Monaghan, Cavan, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Waterford and Ennis. These museums are all under the control and management of local authorities and are funded by them. I have an active policy of encouraging the development of further county museums to which similar loans can also be made by the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> Furthermore, a new Irish Folklife Museum will open at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo in 2001 which will house the national folklife collections. This project is being carried out by the National Museum of Ireland with the co-operation and assistance of Mayo County Council and will bring a major national collection to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The museum also has loans of artefacts at Avondale House, County Wicklow, Swiss Cottage, Cahir, County Tipperary, Muckross House, Killarney, County Kerry and Derrynane House, County Kerry, among others.</P>
    <P>In October 1999, I designated the first eight museums and their curators for purposes of acquiring and holding on behalf of the State archaeological objects which are primarily of local interest. These designations are carried out under the terms of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, and the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997. This provides a further impetus to the development of the museum service in Ireland and further affirms my commitment to encourage growth in this area and access for the public to museum collections of the highest standards in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of objects in the National Museum which might be available for display in locations outside the museum. The National Museum of Ireland is constantly acquiring new objects for the national collections, some of which are suitable for display while others are more appropriate to the research collections because of their type or condition.</P>
    <P>The museum's existing loans have all been made in response to requests for specific named items. The Director of the National Museum of Ireland will continue to respond to all requests for loans of specific items, in accordance with the museum's loan policy. The National Museum requires a minimum of 12 months notice for requests for substantial loans of material.</P>

      <Quest>the plans she has to grant aid the refurbishment of listed houses; if she will have her Department, in co-operation with the local authorities, carry out an up to date listing of houses and buildings of historical and architectural interest not currently listed to prevent further loss of structures; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21515/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical <Col N="1837" /> heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995 and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May 1998, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the Package of Proposals for Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage. That package, which is being progressively implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As part of the package, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government launched, in 1999, a grant scheme for the conservation of protected structures, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of 12 years.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. To date, I have recommended that 791 buildings be included in the record of protected structures of a number of planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers not only to <Col N="1838" /> deal with development proposals affecting them but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>My Department manages in the region of 740 national monuments and historic properties and funding is fully committed to caring for these sites. In these circumstances it is not proposed, in general, to acquire any further properties which might be offered for sale. There may be exceptional circumstances where acquisition will be pursued, for example, to consolidate an existing holding. It is not possible to quantify such cases.</P>

      <P>I have always believed that the effective communication of the conservation message to children of school going age is a key element in our efforts to effectively protect our heritage in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Towards that end, I have instructed the education and visitor services division of my Department to examine how this message might be better delivered to schools, and in that context a number of avenues are being actively considered. These include a more effective system for liaison by my Department's heritage sites and properties with local schools, the preparation of an appropriate heritage module for use at transition year level, and, as the Deputy has suggested, a video which would present the essentials of the heritage message in clear and easily understood terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these proposals will take longer to pursue than others, and may have staffing and other resource implications which will have to be <Col N="1839" /> evaluated. Relevant issues will also have to be fully discussed with the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>As I have already explained to the Deputy in my responses to earlier questions, it is apparent from a detailed survey that Conolly's Folly does require some restoration. However, the more immediate priority is the restoration programme for Castletown House itself, and the folly will have to wait until a later stage. In the meantime, the condition of the folly will be monitored and the position will be regularly reassessed.</P>

      <P>This matter is now the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North-<Col N="1843" /> South implementation body for inland waterways, established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement signed in March 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it had been hoped that the Royal Canal towpath at the rear of Croke Park would be re-opened to the public last April. However, because construction target dates were not met, an extension of time to September was subsequently agreed with Dúchas &ndash; Waterways Ireland &ndash; and residents. I understand that this deadline has also not been met and that the GAA has requested a further and, hopefully, final extension of time to the end of the year. Waterways Ireland informs me that it expects the GAA to consult again with residents in the matter. It will also insist that the site must be made safe before accepting the handover of this section of canal for public use.   </P>

      <P>While this matter now comes within the responsibilities of Waterways Ireland, the North-South implementation body for inland waterways, established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement signed in March 1999, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question &ndash; Question No. 272, on 23 May 2000. Under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, there is provision for the seizure of alcohol by the Garda from a person who is intoxicated in certain circumstances in a public place. The gardaí have approval to enter onto canal property in the exercise of their duties. Accordingly, the enforcement of the above legislation offers the best way to tackle these cases of anti-social behaviour. Any concerns that the Deputy may have with canal by-laws should be taken up directly by him with Waterways Ireland.</P>

      <P>Limerick is one of six locations that have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing by the CCTV Advisory Committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV applications. The other locations, in alphabetical order, are Bray, Cork, Dublin south central, Dundalk and Finglas.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin south central, to include Grafton Street and its surrounding areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The order in which the remaining priority locations, including Limerick, will be undertaken has not yet been decided.</P>
      <P>I can, however, confirm that it is intended to commence the installation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible but I am unable at this stage to give a definitive timescale in this regard.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that it is their intention to include a camera for William Street as part of the CCTV proposals for the city.</P>
      <P>Some delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects due, in part, to the fact that the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has also impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is primarily aimed at developing an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities. Under the programme grants are allocated mainly to voluntary and community organisations to assist with the development of sporting and recreational facilities. However, applications under the programme are <Col N="1862" /> considered from schools which make joint applications with local sports clubs or community groups for funding for a facility. Any such facility must provide for significant levels of usage by the local community and demonstrate that the facilities will meet an identified deficiency in the locality, as agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the funding of primary and second level schools is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science. However, I will communicate to the Minister the Deputy's question for direct reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under current arrangements, pupils with special needs who are of second level age, can be catered for in mainstream second level schools or in the special school system.</P>
      <P>Pupils with less serious disabilities are often capable of functioning successfully in the mainstream second level system on a fully integrated basis with the support of resource teachers and/or special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>Where more serious special needs are involved, placement in a special school may be the required response. A range of special schools is provided, each of which is dedicated to catering for a particular disability group. All special schools operate at reduced pupil teacher ratios and attract special rates of capitation funding and special needs assistant support.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, special schools cater for children up to the end of the school year in which the children reach their 18th birthday. On leaving the special school, these young people may transfer to one of a range of vocational training centres which offer education and training programmes for young adults.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns which have been raised regarding the general adequacy of provision for children with special needs of second level age and beyond. In 1999, a special planning group was established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the very near future and I am confident that the group's recommendations will provide a basis for the development of a more effective range of educational responses to the needs of the children to whom the Deputy refers.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Music in Education Report of the Joint Committee on Education and Science with great interest. I welcome, in particular, the unambiguous support expressed in the report for the revised primary school music programme designed by the National Council for <Col N="1867" /> Curriculum and Assessment and introduced to schools in the last school-year.</P>
      <P>The phased implementation of the revised curriculum in schools is being linked to the delivery of the primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, for schools in co-operation with the education centre network. Phasing, however, will not preclude schools from introducing any area of the curriculum, such as music, prior to the provision of in-career development in that area. The training strategy in the case of music, when activated, will be informed by experience gained in supporting the implementation of other areas of the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>The availability and use of specialist music teaching skills in primary schools is dealt with comprehensively in the teacher guidelines which accompany the revised music programme. The PCSP training phase will make use of highly skilled practitioners who will assist schools in the successful implementation of the programme. In the longer term, this expertise will be added to that already available to schools through education centres.</P>
      <P>I have noted in particular the joint committee's views on matters relating to the design and assessment of second-level music syllabi and its concern over examination outcomes. I will undertake to pass those views to the NCCA for consideration in its ongoing programme of syllabus review.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate will continue to advise and support schools and individual teachers on matters pertaining to curriculum implementation. The process of whole school evaluation, which focuses, <i>inter alia</i>, on the quality of teaching and learning, will include all aspects of the integrated curriculum in primary schools, while music may be included as a subject for specific evaluation in planning an evaluation of a second-level school. School development planning, which is now the focus of substantial support from my Department, affords schools opportunities to plan structured curricular implementation under the guidance of the school leadership.</P>
      <P>In the matter of support mechanisms for school-based music education, curriculum documentation encourages schools to make use of music resources within the school community, such as those identified by the joint committee in order to enrich pupils' musical experience. In relation to services provided by local authority arts officers, I will be pleased to explore the potential of such services for schools with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that financial support from my Department for curriculum implementation has expanded significantly in recent times, in <Col N="1868" /> areas such as literacy and science education. I will continue to review the resource needs of areas such as music education in the context of broadening support mechanisms for schools.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have previously welcomed the report, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding provisions for second level schools and I have commended the group for the clarity of its approach and the quality of the analysis undertaken.</P>
      <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>In this connection I would draw the attention of the Deputy to my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to per capita grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <P>Measadh go raibh an riachtanas a bhain leis an nGaeilge diúltach, nach é an oiread sin de thairbhe a bhain leis agus go rachadh an t-athrú a bhí i gceist chun leasa do sheasamh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna agus i measc múinteoirí.

    <P>Tar éis an tuairisc a mheas, d'iarr an Roinn a thuilleadh anailíse.

Socraíodh ansin, cé gur éirigh leis an múnla cuid de na haidhmeanna a leagadh síos a bhaint amach, nach raibh sé oiriúnach le tabhairt isteach i scoileanna sa riocht ina bhfuil sé.</P>
    <P>Tá impleachtaí nach beag iad ag baint le measúnú praiticiúil a thabhairt isteach, agus go háirithe mar a bhaineann sé le hionracas scrúdú na hArdteistiméireachta féin.

Agus níor cheart, ach an oiread, go gcuirfeadh an modh measúnaithe phraiticiúil isteach ar am múinteoireachta sa seomra ranga.</P>
    <P>Shocraigh mé na siollabais nua san fhisic agus sa cheimic a thabhairt isteach i Meán Fómhair na bliana seo gan aon mhír de mheasúnú praiticiúil leis don chéad dá chohórt d'iarrthóirí, i.e. iad sin a thógfaidh scrúdú na hArdteistiméireachta i 2002 agus i 2003. Tabharfaidh sin deis chun an clár feabhsúchán acmhainní agus an clár feabhsúchán i scileanna múinteoireachta, a bhfuil an-dul chun cinn déanta aige, a chur i bhfeidhm</P>

      <Quest>the amount of resources identified within his Department to budget for provision of additional facilities to primary and post- primary schools for the education of asylum seekers; the manner in which these funds have been allocated to the various schools; the details in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy no doubt will be aware, no distinction is made between asylum seekers and other categories of non-nationals at primary or post-primary school level where the provision of resources is concerned.</P>
      <P>At primary level an additional appointment is sanctioned in the case of schools which have 15 or more non-national pupils enrolled to cater for their English language needs. To date 62 teachers have been sanctioned for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Where primary schools have smaller numbers of non-national pupils enrolled grants are paid to enable the school authorities employ teachers on a part-time basis to provide English language support. These grants amount to £5,000 in the case of schools with four to nine such pupils and £7,500 where ten to 14 pupils are enrolled. A small start-up grant is also payable. The total amount already paid out in grants to primary schools is £269,000.</P>
      <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 21 whole time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of pupils who do not speak English as their first language.</P>
      <P>Where extra accommodation is shown to be necessary as a result of the enrolment of non-national pupils, my Department bears the cost of providing such accommodation.</P>
      <P>My Department has established the refugee language support unit which is responsible for training of teachers catering for non-national pupils. That unit is also responsible for the preparation of benchmarks and teaching materials and for devising new English language programmes to non-nationals. The unit also delivers or organises for the delivery of English language courses to adult refugees. A total of £479,533 has been provided for the unit so far this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> I should also point out that all non-national pupils who are validly enrolled are included in the overall school enrolment for the purposes of capitation, free books and other grant schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>A special class for pupils with autism was established in the school referred to by the Deputy in September, 1999.</P>
      <P>Such classes operate at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. I understand that there are currently five pupils with autism enrolled in the class. The class has the service of a teacher and a special needs assistant. My Department has also allocated a further special needs assistant to cater for the particular needs of one of the pupils attending the class.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for providing therapeutic services, such as speech therapy and occupational therapy, rests with the relevant health authority.</P>
      <P>I understand that the school in question does not yet have the service of a psychologist from the national educational psychological service. The service is currently available to all second level schools and approximately one quarter of primary schools. The process of extending the service to all primary schools is continuing as additional psychologists are recruited. In the meantime, responsibility for assessment services in areas not covered by NEPS remains the responsibility of the relevant health authority.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate the special equipment needs of the special class referred to by the Deputy. Officials of my Department will be in contact with the school in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the details of this case.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post- primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to progress this case further, a questionnaire issued to the child's mother in May 2000, which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the NEPS on behalf of her child. To date, the completed questionnaire has not been received in the post-primary administration section of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his/her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians, where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt. When assessing income from self-employment or farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit/loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in touch with Carlow vocational education committee, the body responsible for the assessment of means in this case, and it is understood that the reckonable income exceeded the income limits for the award of a grant in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year. Accordingly, the candidate to whom the Deputy refers was ineligible for grant assistance in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>
      <P>For the 2000-2001 academic year, the reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes is £20,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant &ndash; 50% &ndash; in respect of which the income limit is £21,400. Where two or more children, or the candidate's parent, are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, by £4,540 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> If there has been a change in reckonable income in this case, the candidate may wish to apply to Carlow Vocational Education Committee to have his eligibility for grant assistance assessed for the current academic year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not provide funding in respect of interpreters in mainstream primary schools. However, earlier this year a major new initiative to ensure that there is appropriate educational provision in place for non-English speaking pupils at primary school level was announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> The new initiative ensures that primary schools that have 15 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits are automatically entitled to an additional temporary teacher for a period of up to two years. Schools with 30 or more such pupils are entitled to two temporary teachers. Where two schools operate on one campus and have 15 or more such pupils they are entitled to an additional temporary teacher on a shared basis. Schools eligible for additional teacher(s) also receive a once-off grant of £200.</P>
    <P>Primary schools in which between four and 14, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled receive grant assistance from my Department. Schools with between four and nine such pupils receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits.</P>
    <P>Schools with three or fewer such pupils would be expected to provide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has not, to date, applied in writing for funding under the terms of this scheme although I understand that the terms of the scheme were explained to it in a telephone call to officials in the primary administration section of my Department in Athlone.</P>
    <P>It would seem from the information available to me that the school does not qualify for funding under the terms of the scheme as it has less than four non-English speaking non-national pupils enrolled. However if the school wants to submit an official application for assistance to my Department, any such application will receive due consideration.</P>

      <P>The promotion of sport and the development and enhancement of sports facilities in schools is a priority for me and I have already announced a number of initiatives in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of increased levels of funding for school accommodation, which this Government has provided since taking up office, <Col N="1879" /> all major capital projects at both primary and second level schools require the provision of adequate sporting facilities. This extends to the provision of both physical education halls/general purpose areas and the provision of hard play areas and, where site conditions allow, playing pitches.</P>
    <P>While the nature of sporting facilities provided for second level schools is suited for use by the wider community after school hours, ultimately this is a matter for determination by the management authorities of schools. Similarly, a request to enhance sporting facilities at a school through lottery funding is a matter for individual school authorities in conjunction where necessary with local communities and sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>The importance of physical education is highlighted in the revised primary curriculum and in this context I am putting in place new arrangements for promoting sport and physical education in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am providing a new scheme of grants for the development of sports and the promotion of healthy lifestyles in primary schools. At an initial cost of £2 million per annum, the scheme will involve an annual grant of £1,000 for each primary school in a disadvantaged area and £500 for all other primary schools. This grant will be used for coaching, mentoring and equipment. Detailed information on the new scheme will be sent to all primary schools in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I am also appointing a new national sports co-ordinator for primary schools. The national co-ordinator, assisted by a number of assistant co-ordinators, will have the brief of raising the awareness of sports and healthy lifestyles throughout our schools nationally. I am establishing a national steering group to oversee this project and arrangements are currently under way to put in place an appropriate structure for this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in secondary schools under two separate schemes. Under the scheme introduced in 1978 for the employment of school secretaries in the larger schools, <Col N="1880" /> my Department meets the full cost of salary. A pension provision, introduced in 1985, applies to secretaries under this scheme.</P>
      <P>This scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme under which all schools, other than those in the 1978 scheme, with 200 or more pupils are eligible for secretarial assistance.</P>
      <P>This scheme provides a grant to schools, which is not related to any particular pay scale. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The level and extent of the service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for clerical services as resources permit. As the secretaries concerned are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and his/her employer. These individualised arrangements preclude the introduction of a centralised superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to secondary schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible</P>
      <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the national educational psychological service on behalf of her child.</P>

      <P>The results of the survey of radon levels in schools carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland indicate that 15 of the primary and post primary schools in County Kildare that accepted the invitation to participate in the survey had radon levels above 200 bequerels per cubic metre. Twelve of these schools showed maximum levels of radon gas of less than 300 bq per cubic metre. In the remaining three schools the maximum level of radon gas was over 400 bq per cubic metre.</P>
      <P>A consultant was engaged by my Department to provide detailed plans on the remediation plans for schools showing very high levels of radon gas, including the three schools in County Kildare with levels in excess of 400 bq per cubic metre. My Department received these plans this week and preparations are being made to arrange to have the remediation work carried out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Consultants from the Buildings Research Establishment in London have been engaged to advise on the appropriate remediation measures in schools with radon levels between 200 bcqMf7&gt;3 and 400 bcqMf7&gt;3. The consultants are currently implementing remediation measures on a trial basis in approximately ten schools. The trial results are likely to inform the overall strategy to be adapted for the remediation programmes for schools with radon levels between 200 bcqMf7&gt;3 and 400 bcqMf7&gt;3. The trial results are expected to be available next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years, a range of initiatives has been introduced to ensure a sufficient supply of skilled personnel in emerging labour market needs areas. These initiatives have focused to a large extent on the needs associated with the <Col N="1886" /> strong growth of the information technology sector.</P>
      <P>The first of these initiatives was the joint public-private initiative for capital funding, 1996-2000, aimed at providing some 6,200 additional new places in areas of agreed labour market needs including 1,800 places in the computer science area.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the interim skills group in late 1996, which identified emerging skills needs, an additional 650 places in software engineering and over 500 additional places in engineering technician programmes were approved for the 1997-98 academic year as part of the Government response An Action Plan for Skills.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the Government announced the establishment of the £250 million education technology investment fund and the Scientific and Technological Education Fund Bill was enacted in December 1997. One of the objectives of the fund is to develop new areas of activities in third level institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified. The fund provided investment of £60 million for the skills area to provide an additional annual output of 1,000 software graduates and 750 technicians.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Government established the expert group on future skills needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. The first report of the expert group on future skills needs was published in December 1998 and addressed the needs of the information technology sector. In response to the needs identified, this Government approved an additional investment of £75 million for the provision of 5,400 third level places, predominately in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas. Some £6 million was provided for the continuation of the post-graduate conversion programmes in IT related areas and there are some 1,500 students currently participating in these programmes.</P>
      <P>The accelerated technician programmes, which the institutes of technology introduced in January 1998 in manufacturing technology, have since been expanded to include information technology. These programmes involve structured work placement for six months and are based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement. To date, some 1,500 students have participated in the programmes, which are aimed at alleviating identified skills shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second report of the expert group focused on a wider range of skills needs. In relation to the IT sector, the report notes that, as a result of this Government's investment, the projected annual supply of IT degree professionals will be more <Col N="1887" /> than double the 1996 levels by 2003, while the supply of IT technicians will increase by more than 50%. Given these trends, the expert group did not recommend a further increase in places. The expert group will, however, continue to monitor the situation within the IT sector and will bring forward recommendations as appropriate.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, these initiatives have enhanced the educational opportunities for students intent on careers in the IT sector.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any research which seeks specifically to identify trends in third level education with reference to identifying subjects now chosen by students which will enhance their employment prospects. The Deputy may be interested in the research undertaken by Dr. David Tuohy of the education department in University College Dublin. Dr. Tuohy was engaged by the Commission on the points system to undertake research in relation to demand for third level places, and in particular, into interest patterns in the applications process and student profiles for particular courses. I am arranging for a copy of Dr. Tuohy's report to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority produces an annual report entitled First Destination of Awards Recipients in Higher Education based on a survey of graduates as at 30 April following receipt of an award. This series of reports contains data on higher education courses taken and the subsequent employment patterns/prospects. The latest published survey is that in respect of 1998 graduates which was published in January 2000. This survey found that for the first time ever over half of the recipients, 50.7%, obtained employment in Ireland, while the percentage obtaining employment abroad was 8%, the lowest in over ten years. The percentage engaged in further study or training was 35% and the percentage seeking employment was 2.4%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally as the Deputy will be aware, the Government established the expert group on future skills needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. The expert group on future skills needs undertakes research into <Col N="1888" /> specific labour market needs and recommends steps necessary to meet emerging skills needs.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to nursing is that the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training is currently funded by the Department of Health and Children. The Commission on Nursing has recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four year degree programme which will encompass clinical placements, including twelve months continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The Commission envisaged that the start of the 2002-03 academic year would be specified as the commencement date of the proposed new degree programme. The nursing education forum was established by the Minister for Health and Children to agree a strategy for the implementation of degree level pre-registration nursing education and training. I understand that the forum is due to report shortly.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to medical education is that the current intake to undergraduate medical courses is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980/81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. The question of reviewing the current quota arrangements is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>An expert group was established by the Minister for Health and Children in accordance with Labour Court Recommendation 15515 to address, <i>inter alia</i>, the education and training of certain paramedic grades, including speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. Following the final report of the expert group, the Minister for Health and Children has approved the terms of reference for a workforce study on physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The terms of reference have been agreed with the Higher Education Authority and the authority will be represented on the steering group for the study. As an interim measure, in response to the shortages of professionals in these disciplines, arrangements have been made to increase the number of places available for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a health services skills group to,<i> inter alia</i>, identify the skills needs of different sectors of the health service. My Department and the Higher Education Authority <Col N="1889" /> will participate fully in the work of the group, when established, and I will ensure the needs identified within the health sector will continue to be met.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the condition of physical facilities in schools.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, the Government increased the level of funding for primary and post-primary school buildings from a total of £72 million per annum to £181 million per annum. This has resulted in significant progress being made in the elimination of substandard accommodation in the recent past. I acknowledge that more needs to be done and, to this end, the Government is committed to ensuring further progress is made in this area in the context of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy for the 2000-01 school year is not available as the data in respect of pupil enrolments has not yet been submitted by all schools to my Department.</P>
      <P>The Government since taking up office has introduced a range of initiatives to help reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools. The pupil/teacher ratio has declined from 22.2 to 1 in the 1996-97 school year to 20.4 to 1 in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the current year together with the creation of an additional 200 posts primarily to tackle educational disadvantage will help further to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio in the 2000/2001 school year.</P>
      <P>An additional 1,000 teaching posts are being allocated at second level in the 2000-01 school year. A proportion of these posts were provided to facilitate the reduction from 19:1 to 18:1 in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level has been reduced significantly in recent years. <Col N="1890" /> The creation of the additional posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil/teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness an additional 900 teaching posts will be created at primary level and 400 at second level. These additional posts will further reduce the pupil/teacher ratio at both primary and second level over the period of the programme.</P>

      <P>This Government has substantially boosted the supply of trained primary teachers since taking office.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. Subject to agreement with the colleges of education it is planned to have a further post-graduate course, with a proposed intake of 280 students, to commence early in 2001.</P>
      <P>It is projected that the intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
      <P>Between 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors which affect the demand for primary teachers. These include the number of teachers opting to take career breaks, the number of secondments approved and the age at which teachers opt to retire on a voluntary basis. The creation of additional posts in a particular school year and the retention of posts arising through the allocation of the demographic dividend also affect the demand for teachers.</P>
      <P>My Department reviews the enrolment projections for schools and the factors affecting the demand for teaching posts on a regular basis and endeavours to ensure that the supply of teachers available meets the demand.</P>

      <P>Children with special needs who are attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis may require special teaching and child care support. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to the support services they require to enable them to benefit fully from the education system. The service in question may take the form of resource teaching support or child care support or both, depending on the particular needs of the pupils or group of pupils involved.  Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated over 560 resource teaching posts and more than 1,400 child care posts to cater for children with special needs within the primary system. My Department is continuing to extend these services in response to assessed needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in September 1999 my Department extended the remedial teaching service to every first and second level school in the country with <Col N="1892" /> a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower ratios have been advised that they may apply to my Department for a remedial teaching service where they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national educational psychological service has now been established and this service will continue to be expanded to ensure that adequate assessment services are available to all children with special needs.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science it is my intention to continue to build on the above developments and to ensure that all schools catering for children with special needs are given the support they require to carry out this very important role.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to meet the special equipment needs of pupils with disabilities within the mainstream primary school system and in special schools. The level of funding available this year is £945,000. In addition, in the current year, I have allocated a sum of £500,000 under the IT2000 initiative for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Allocations of equipment grants are based on an assessed level of need of individual pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> Where a resource teacher is appointed to a school to assist with the education of certain pupils with disabilities integrated into mainstream classes, an equipment grant of £400 is allocated, followed by an annual grant of £200. This rate of grant aid is currently under review.</P>
    <P>A similar level of equipment grant is paid in respect of remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>Additionally, in the current school year, an information and technology grant of £700 issued to all schools with the service of remedial and resource teachers for children with disabilities for the purchase of relevant hardware/software items.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service agency is an executive agency of my Department. It has responsibility for providing an educational psychological service to all children and young people attending schools and other educational institutions recognised by my Department, with a particular emphasis on supporting those with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>At present all post-primary schools and approximately a quarter of all primary schools have access to the service offered by NEPS. However, the expansion of NEPS is currently under way in line with a development plan that provides for every school in the country being assigned to one of the NEPS psychologists as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Five psychologists who were formerly employees of the National Rehabilitation Board are now employed by the National Disability Authority to work on a contractual basis for NEPS. They are ensuring continuing psychological support for children and young people with sensory and physical disabilities in all schools.</P>
    <P>My Department does not fund the cost of eye or hearing tests for children with sight or hearing difficulties. This responsibility rests with the health boards.</P>
    <P>The visiting teacher service of my Department provides a support service for children who are visually or hearing impaired. This service is available from the time of diagnosis right through schooling as required. In addition to providing advice and support to parents and schools, the visiting teacher makes recommendations to my Department with regard to the equipment needs of such pupils, such as radio aids, braillers and other specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>The Government's initiative of November 1998, whereby all pupils assessed as having a special educational need arising from a disability are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs, is a positive step towards the integration of pupils with special needs within mainstream primary education.</P>

      <P>Representations made to me by members of the Oireachtas are recorded in my private office on a Lotus Notes system. An acknowledgement issues to the correspondent and the papers are transmitted to the appropriate section of my Department for the preparation of a draft reply.</P>
      <P>The data recorded includes the name of the correspondent, the nature of the query, the date of receipt, the date an acknowledgement was issued and the name of the officer to whom the correspondence was sent. Individual line sections of the Department that receive large volumes of representations also have their own tracking system in place.</P>
      <P>In the line sections, draft replies are normally prepared by the member of staff dealing with the administration of the various schemes, programmes and operations which are the subject of the correspondence, or by higher officers where the subject of the correspondence is complex or impinges on policy.</P>
      <P>The clerical staff in my office are responsible for tracking the replies and issuing reminders to sections where replies are overdue.</P>
      <P>The volume of representations and the diverse nature of the subject matter is such that only the staff on the ground dealing with the issues are in a position to prepare replies to the queries raised by Oireachtas members. Freedom of Information queries are dealt with in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that the Public Service Executive Union in my Department was engaged in industrial action from January until April of this year in pursuit of a staffing claim. The industrial action included an instruction to, union members not to answer representations from public representatives. The backlog of representations from this period, coupled with the normal volume of representations made on a daily basis since the cessation of the industrial action, has led to a very large backlog, which can only be eliminated by the allocation of additional staffing resources to the task, both at central level and in the line sections. To meet these needs the Government have approved the appointment of over 100 extra staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's overall aim, in accordance with our customer service statement, is to reply to all correspondence within a period of 21 days and where this cannot be done, to issue an acknowledgement. In the case of representations from Members of the Oireachtas, there is a general instruction that an interim reply should issue <Col N="1896" /> if a final reply cannot be issued within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible for existing staff to comply with these targets at present. A significant number of vacancies exist in my Department in the clerical and administrative grades, and existing staff are under considerable strain in seeking to deliver the standard of service to which they aspire. Every effort is being made to fill the vacant positions as quickly as possible. However, Deputies will be aware that Departments are facing the same labour market constraints as other sectors at present.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's correspondence with my Department, along with that of all other Members of the Oireachtas, will be replied to as quickly as possible. In recognition of this fact I have recently assigned an executive officer to liaise with Deputies and Senators on queries relating to my Department. In addition, I will assign a higher executive officer to head up a unit with exclusive responsibility for tracking representations from members of the Oireachtas and ensuring that replies are issued within a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of non-completion at third level is a complex one and figures on attrition across higher education have not yet been established on a common and comparable basis. There is no simple explanation and no one simple initiative that will address the issue. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also, of course, be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>At the request of my Department, the council of directors of institutes of technology has commissioned the Education Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes, which consists of a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four-year period and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extracts from a first draft of the report, in respect of the quantitative analysis above were <Col N="1897" /> published in the media in August of this year. It was reported that a study of achievement rates in 11 institutes of technology found that two out of five students drop out without completing their courses. It was further reported that in engineering and computing the figure rose to 50% and that in six particular courses it was 80% or more. It is understood that the report will be formally submitted to my Department shortly. Meanwhile, the second part of the study is proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the institute, which is a similar and comparable study to that commissioned by the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology.</P>
    <P>The above studies are being funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a database on attrition/drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for institutes' students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile has been made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>Institutes of technology continue to introduce a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction/orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of at risk first year students.</P>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-00 to address the issue of non-completion in the technological sector. This funding supports and complements the programmes already in place and has regard to the recommendations of the national committee on retention in relation to the funding of action projects/programmes both short and long-term based on best practice. In addition, £8 of the student services charge collected in institutes of technology is being dedicated to projects linked to attrition and access.</P>
    <P>Through these initiatives the institutes are developing their strategies and from this year a dedicated member of staff is being assigned to work with students and staff to develop mechanisms aimed at improving retention rates. Considerable work is also being done in collaboration with the national centre for guidance in education and with the post-primary inspectorate in my Department to develop other positive actions in this area. I am also actively addressing the pro<Col N="1898" /> vision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance, in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Guidance in Education organised a colloquium &ldquo;Staying Power &ndash; Increasing Retention Rates in Higher Education&rdquo; on behalf of my Department in November 1999. This colloquium brought together key personnel from post-primary schools, higher education institutes, parent association representatives, trades unions, management bodies, the institute of guidance counsellors, and my Department to debate issues of co-operation and good practice and to make recommendations for future actions. The publication of Staying Power was launched on 6 September 2000. Its recommendations will be the subject of further study and consideration by all the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 323 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's question relates to the arrangement whereby students who have attained NCVA level 2 awards can progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology. Information in relation to the drop-out or failure rates for these students is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>The Government is considering all aspects of the proposed new decentralisation programme. It is intended that decisions will be taken before the end of the year. It would be premature for me to comment on any matter relating to the programme at this point.</P>
