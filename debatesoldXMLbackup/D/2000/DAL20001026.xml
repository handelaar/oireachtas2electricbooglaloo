      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member. <Col N="2" /> Yesterday, on the question, &ldquo;That Deputy Gormley be suspended from the service of the Dáil&rdquo;, a division was claimed and, in accordance with Standing Order 61, that division must take place now.</P>

        <b>:</b> I wish to protest as the Taoiseach has made no provision for any other Deputies elected to this House other than Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party Members, which is quite unjust. I will not make a major issue of the matter this morning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The idea that we would have a debate where Members would be confined to five minutes, and which would be all over in approximately one hour, about the Government's greatest failure to deliver a decent infrastructure for our people is not acceptable. The Irish people are in despair at the Government's failure to provide adequate facilities for traffic, adequate public transport and adequate servicing for housing land. As that is what the debate is about, there should be no time limit placed on it. Members should not be confined to five minutes as people have much more to say about this appalling failure of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the recent judgment in a libel case where the Oireachtas was criticised for the absence of guidelines for juries on the scale of damages in particular cases, does the Government intend to provide for this matter in legislation it is bringing before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The defamation Bill is at an early stage of preparation but I am not sure if that matter is covered. I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach may or may not be aware, the lack of guidelines for jurors in regard to the scale of damages was the problem in this case which received a certain amount of prominence. I understand the libel laws as such, the issue of what constitutes libel and so on was not in dispute, only whether the damages were proportionate. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who presumably is familiar with the legislation as he is preparing it, whether it deals with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told me it does not. I understand the Supreme Court made it known that it was considered excessive and the case was sent back to the High Court. The Act is in the early stage of preparation. It does not cover that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the statement issued by the IRA to be sufficient to meet the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement so that the Executive can continue to do its work and the bodies associated with the Agreement can proceed to consolidate the progress that has been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of developments can be seen as positive. The programme for Government, which has been produced by the Executive in recent days, the budget for next year, which the Executive has agreed, the Executive work programme and the level of co-operation within the Executive are strengthening the institutions. This view is widely held throughout Northern Ireland and is well presented in this morning's <i>Belfast Newsletter </i>editorial which takes a positive view of all that is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still some negative elements. Yesterday's statement and actions are helpful. I would like to see full engagement between General de <Col N="9" /> Chastelain and the republican movement. Nevertheless the outlook is positive. It would be unthinkable that anyone would try to undermine these positive elements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Taoiseach has said about the positive steps which are being taken, both within the Executive and with regard to the inspection of arms dumps. Would the Taoiseach agree that the Good Friday Agreement commits those associated with paramilitaries to more than mere engagement, which is a rather elastic word, with General de Chastelain? It commits them to the actual decommissioning of weapons. That was put into the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; perhaps it need not have been but it was &ndash; by all parties. There seems to have been little progress in this area which was committed to in the Good Friday Agreement, as distinct from inspection which was not committed to in the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the risk with inspection as a permanent arrangement is that it almost seems to confer legitimacy on the matter being inspected? If senior people from around the world are allowed to look at arms dumps there is an inference that there is nothing wrong with arms dumps. As the Taoiseach has said on many occasions, there clearly is something wrong with arms dumps in a democracy unless they are controlled by the Dáil, which these are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this question. The inspections are not intended to show legitimacy. They are intended to show and prove that the arms are beyond use at this stage. It is hoped the second inspection will show this to be the case. This does not take away from the fact that the Good Friday Agreement declared that arms were to be put beyond use and out of operation. That can only happen by the engagement of the international independent commission on decommissioning and the republican and loyalist groups. I note from this morning's <i>Belfast Newsletter </i>and from what I have been hearing that there is a view in Northern Ireland that no one seriously expects the decommissioning of loyalist weapons to happen while all the feelings of vengeance and terror remain close to the surface. That issue must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I have continually urged Sinn Féin to urge the republican movement to engage in and renew the process with General de Chastelain. I say this knowing there can be only one conclusion to that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that another helpful step on the path to peace would be an indication by the republican movement in particular, and also the loyalist paramilitaries in so far as they are involved, that it no longer wishes the continued exile from Northern Ireland of the 1,200 people who have been forced to leave the country under threat of intimidation and even <Col N="10" /> death? This indication would be similar to the British Government's statement that it is no longer pursuing people who are on the run for politically motivated crimes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the House to request that the totally illegal and criminal expulsion orders against people who were expelled from Northern Ireland by republicans for various reasons be cancelled, so that people who wish to return can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn's views on this matter. I will raise it wherever I can.</P>
      <P>We should also try to make progress with regard to people who are on the run, or are termed OTRs. I know this arises in a different context because it concerns the legal position of the British Government and its various arms. I am not trying to equate the two categories because they cannot be equated. I find it increasingly difficult to respond to queries from the United States and Britain regarding people who left Northern Ireland in the early years of the troubles and who are not sure whether they are listed as expelled or what might happen to them if they return. The sooner we regularise those matters the better. I do not say they will be easy to regularise. The British Attorney General has considerable difficulty with these issues. However, it would help if we could come to a finalisation of those matters.</P>
      <P>I will raise Deputy Quinn's first point, with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support what Deputy Quinn said on this topic earlier in the week and again today.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his use of the word &ldquo;regularise&rdquo; when he said he believed these issues of exclusion should be regularised? I am sure he did not mean to say that. These exlusion orders were never legitimate. They were issued by organisations which have no legitimacy and never had. They should simply be withdrawn. We must take a very clear stand on this. We cannot be in a situation where this sort of thing is legitimised or even regularised. It must stop and the House must be clear about that. I know this is the Taoiseach's view. Perhaps in his eagerness to be conciliatory he used a word he did not mean to use.</P>

      <P>I invite the Taoiseach, using the status he holds on behalf of us all, to indicate that the British Government and others including the IRA and paramilitaries should recognise, within the context of the Good Friday Agreement, that as we have nearly completed a programme of release of prisoners who were found guilty, by whatever means, and put in prison, it is now time for a unilateral and total statement of intent by all relevant parties that the fears of people who <Col N="11" /> felt obliged to leave Northern Ireland, who were coerced or intimated into doing so or who feel they may be the subject of criminal prosecutions, from whatever jurisdiction, in the context of the violence of Northern Ireland, are now removed, in the context of the prisoner release programme and as a further confidence building measure on the path to peace.</P>

      <P>If I used the word &ldquo;regularise&rdquo; in connection with people who were excluded by paramilitaries I did not intend to do so. I thought I had used the word in the context of others who were properly excluded. Withdrawn is the correct word. I take Deputy Quinn's point. Many of these cases involve people who are not sure of their category. Many have now settled and have families. I feel particularly sorry for people who have ageing family members whom they cannot visit because they were in some way caught up in the troubles 30 years ago. I would particularly like to resolve cases such as these. Resolving all the cases might take some time.</P>

    <Title>ASEM III Summit: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the third Asia-Europe meeting, or ASEM III, which took place in South Korea on 19 and 21 October. I was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, who deputised for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>While the venue for this year's summit, Seoul, was agreed at ASEM II in 1998, the holding of the summit in Korea proved timely, given the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Kim Dae-jung. Naturally, therefore, our discussions at ASEM took account of the efforts of President Kim to promote peace and reconciliation throughout the Korean peninsula, and the implications arising from his recent meeting with Kim Jong-il of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea. I am delighted to announce that a Declaration for Peace in the Korean peninsula was agreed by leaders at the summit. This declaration, together with the Chairman's statement and the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework, also agreed by leaders, has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>ASEM has led to a number of Euro-Asian co-operative measures, in a variety of areas, including the Asia-Europe Foundation in culture, and the ASEM Business Forum. This third Asia Europe meeting provided an opportunity for leaders to review progress and achievements so far, to build on what has already been achieved and to plan for comprehensive and sustained co-operation between the two regions. I believe this third summit was a success, not only for Europe-Asia relations, but particularly for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Proceedings opened on Thursday, 19 October, with a preparatory ministerial meeting to finalise the key topics for discussion during the closed leaders' sessions. Heads of State or Government met in three sessions, without officials, over Friday, 20 and Saturday, 21 October. We considered a range of topics related to the three strands of the ASEM process, namely, the promotion of political dialogue, economic and financial co-operation and co-operation in the cultural, educational, social and people-to-people fields. Leaders also discussed the future of ASEM at a working lunch between sessions on Friday, 20 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ASEM III differed from previous Asia-Europe meetings in that there was no fixed agenda. Instead, a range of topics under each of the three pillars of ASEM was proposed for discussion by <Col N="18" /> leaders. In addition, as an alternative to prepared interventions, President Kim, who chaired all sessions, encouraged a free-flowing format which allowed for much deeper discussion across a wider variety of issues.</P>
    <P>During the first session on political dialogue, discussions naturally focused on developments on the Korean peninsula, and President Kim's recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize. While the dialogue between north and south was warmly welcomed, President Kim himself indicated that the greatest challenges remain ahead. Regional security issues were discussed during the first session, with developments in the western Balkans and the recent appointment of President Kostunica in the former Republic of Yugoslavia being of particular interest to our partners. During discussions on European security and defence policy, I indicated that in the context of our forthcoming membership of the UN Security Council, we look forward to close and mutually reinforcing co-operation between the EU and the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>We also discussed developments in the Asian Regional Forum, which recently admitted North Korea as an observer. I welcomed the growth and evolution of this new organisation, as a valuable forum for the discussion by Asian countries of their security concerns. The forum will provide a means for addressing and resolving potential disputes through peaceful negotiation.</P>
    <P>In the first working session there was a lengthy discussion on human rights, during which some criticism of the European approach, and that of the wider western world, was expressed. I pointed out that Ireland and the EU are fully committed to upholding the rights of the individual and, in particular, the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, association and religion. I also noted that we do not believe that the enjoyment of these rights is dependent on the attainment of a particular level of socio-economic development by a state, but rather that they are the absolute minimum to which all human beings are entitled. I also indicated that human rights have now been firmly established as a cornerstone of Ireland's foreign policy and that our commitment to furthering the cause of human rights will be carried through in our work on the UN Security Council. I am pleased to report that my intervention was welcomed by many Asian and European leaders alike who wish to see a real and frank dialogue develop across all areas of EU-Asian relations.</P>
    <P>In discussions on the UN, I restated Ireland's support of Secretary-General Annan's reform efforts. I also noted that the reform should be about making the UN more effective in the economic, social, humanitarian and other fields, and cannot simply be about cost-cutting. I reaffirmed my belief that there is a need for increased levels of development assistance from wealthy nations if significant progress is to be made in reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty. I also indicated that Ireland was ready to play <Col N="19" /> its part by reaching the UN target for overseas development aid by the end of 2007.</P>
    <P>In the working lunch which followed the first closed session, discussions on the future of ASEM took place. Leaders decided to increase the frequency of meetings between Finance Ministers and Foreign Ministers, to ensure a deeper dialogue between the two regions, and asked Foreign Ministers to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ASEM and its activities, including its initiatives, for consideration by leaders at ASEM IV, to be held in two years. From now on, these meetings will take place annually rather than every second year. In 2001, Finance Ministers will meet in Japan, while Foreign Ministers will meet in China.</P>
    <P>The effect of future enlargement of both the EU and the Asia region was also discussed. Leaders agreed on a set of principles, the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework 2000, which provides a road map for Asia Europe relations to 2010, and also sets out criteria for future enlargement of ASEM. Under this framework, ASEM partners have agreed to work for the common goal of maintaining peace and stability, as well as promoting conditions conducive to sustainable economic and social development.</P>
    <P>There will be an increased focus on building mutual awareness and understanding between the two regions. The potential synergy between Asia and Europe will be of tremendous value, not only in addressing economic challenges posed by globalisation, e-commerce and the new economy, but in meeting the social and political challenges of poverty, development, fundamental human rights and the creation of a peaceful and stable world order. This commitment to working together will be given expression through the more frequent meetings at ministerial and senior official level, and the increased co-operation between the ASEM partners in other international fora, such as the United Nations.</P>
    <P>During the second session on economic co-operation, the main discussions focused on multi-lateralism and the WTO, the knowledge based society, the impact of globalisation, the current price of oil, e-commerce and the Internet. Whereas ASEM II had been dominated by the effects of the Asian financial crisis, it was clear from discussions during this summit that the majority of Asian countries present have made significant recoveries over the past two years and are looking forward with much greater optimism. We considered the possible measures which could be adopted to sustain long-term economic stability, and to prevent a recurrence of such economic crises. The role that the IMF can play in this regard, including increased transparency in economic and financial activities, enhanced surveillance and the observance of international codes on fiscal and monetary policy was considered.</P>
    <P>There was also a wide degree of agreement between the EU and Asian partners on the <Col N="20" /> importance of launching a new round of multi-lateral trade negotiations under the WTO. There is much to be gained from a new round, with a broad and embracing agenda which recognises the concerns and aspirations of all participants, both developed and developing. I hope that a timeframe for a new round of global trade negotiations can be agreed in the near future.</P>
    <P>With the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, I attended a formal dinner hosted by President Kim Dae-jung on Friday evening. This afforded me an opportunity to have informal discussions with each of the Asian leaders and to raise Ireland's Asia strategy with them. At the third and final working session, which took place on Saturday morning, discussions focused on co-operation in cultural and other fields. I indicated to leaders that Ireland was delighted to have had the opportunity in June this year to host the fourth Asia-Europe Young Leaders Symposium in Limerick, which I attended. This mechanism affords a unique opportunity for increased co-operation and exchanges between potential leaders of the future. The symposium in Limerick provided an excellent opportunity to promote understanding and knowledge between the Asian countries and Ireland in particular. I also indicated that under our Asia Strategy, Ireland will continue working to develop closer links in the educational and cultural area in addition to building links in the trade, investment and economic fields.</P>
    <P>As regards the Chairman's Statement, effectively the conclusions of the summit, leaders expressed satisfaction at the progress made in the ASEM process since the Bangkok and London Summits and looked forward to intensifying the process in the run up to ASEM IV, which will be held in the autumn of 2002 in Copenhagen during the Danish Presidency of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The statement commends the contribution of the ASEM process to Asia's recovery from the financial crisis of 1998, and it also welcomes political and economic developments in Europe, such as the launch of the euro and strengthening EU institutions, as well as positive developments in Asia, such as Cambodia's accession to ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and the successful ASEAN+3 Summit held in Manila in November of last year.</P>
    <P>In our statement, leaders expressed satisfaction at the progress being made in restoring stability to East Timor and encouraged further efforts by UNTAET, in co-operation with the countries closely involved, in order to guarantee the success of the transition process. I was pleased that we could agree to work together for reform and renewal of the United Nations and the promotion of dialogue in relation to international arms control and disarmament.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we were able to agree on the future use of the ASEM process to co-ordinate the European and Asian response to issues of international concern, such as environmental protection, the impacts of globalisation and infor<Col N="21" /> mation technology on the world economy, the needs of the developing world, transnational organised crime, and especially the promotion and protection of basic human rights and freedoms.</P>
    <P>The summit also approved a number of initiatives in various fields designed to further co-operation in the areas of globalisation, information technology, transnational and law enforcement matters, human resource development, the environment and health.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I had discussions with all the Asian leaders during the ASEM Summit. I took the opportunity to thank those members who expressed support for Ireland during our recent campaign for election to the UN Security Council. I also congratulated Prime Minister Goh on Singapore's election to the Council on the same day.</P>
    <P>I had a brief meeting with Prime Minister Blair on Friday, 20 October. I had previously met the Prime Minister in Scotland at the funeral of Mr. Donald Dewar on Wednesday, 18 October. We discussed the ongoing work by officials in Dublin, London and Belfast, and the forthcoming Ulster Unionist Council meeting which will take place this Saturday.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to have an opportunity for a frank and informal discussion with President Wahid of Indonesia on the margins of the summit. He informed me of a new and ambitious plan to resolve the crisis of refugees in West Timor. President Wahid, together with the East Timorese leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, and Mr. Sergio de Mello, the UN Head of Administration in East Timor, will visit one of the largest refugee camps in West Timor. I understand Prime Minister Howard of Australia may also accompany the group on this visit.</P>
    <P>President Wahid informed me that he intends to initiate a registration procedure whereby refugees in West Timor will be asked if they wish to remain in West Timor or return to East Timor. Those wishing to return will be given protection and secure passage home, while those who opt to stay will be moved to more appropriate and secure accommodation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the President's plans and raised with him the need for early disarming and disbanding of militias in the area. I also assured him of our support to promote peace and stability throughout the region. I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to monitor developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also had a formal bilateral meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji of China. Premier Zhu congratulated me on Ireland's election to the UN Security Council and indicated that China looked forward to working closely with us over the next two years. I thanked him for the hospitality and warm welcome afforded to the Tánaiste and the trade delegation that accompanied her during her visit to China in September this year. Trade between Ireland and China is on an upward trend, with a record high of more than £400 mill<Col N="22" /> ion estimated for bilateral trade during the first six months of this year. This rapid growth in trade since 1998 is largely due to our focus on building and strengthening links with China under our Asia Strategy. We discussed this increase and possible options to develop and strengthen these links further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach yield? Did the Taoiseach, in his discussions with Premier Zhu, raise the issue of China's relationship with Taiwan and the possibility of a more peaceful relationship existing within China?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He raised these issues with me again, reiterating his one China policy and his desire to move to more friendly relationships. As the Deputy will know from having seen the reports, in the week before the ASEM Summit, the Prime Minister of Taiwan was interpreted as stating a changed position on the one China rule which, hopefully, will allow for progress. China is certainly prepared to do business, if that is the position. Its one precondition is that the one China rule must be stated clearly before it enters into any discussions. That is also its position on the Dalai Lama. China says that that position must be publicly stated. The Dalai Lama said it privately but China wants it stated publicly so that it can move in a more progressive way on this issue.</P>
      <P>I recalled the visit of Vice-Premier Li to Ireland earlier this year and I invited Premier Zhu to visit Ireland.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with President Kim, we discussed developments on the Korean peninsula. President Kim outlined his views to me and was interested in hearing our observations on the recent developments in North-South dialogue in Korea and our experiences with our own peace process. He was particularly interested in our views on the challenges that lie ahead for Korea in furthering dialogue and the process of peace and reconciliation. I encouraged President Kim to pursue his policy of openness and dialogue. The House will be aware that a small number of EU member states indicated their intention at ASEM to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. There are aspects of North Korea, however, which remain of concern to us and to other member states, particularly in the area of human rights. Accordingly, while I look forward to being able to consider the establishment of diplomatic relations eventually, quantifiable progress will have to be made in a number of areas, particularly in human rights and non-proliferation, before any decision can be made.</P>
      <P>I briefed President Kim on our work to promote Ireland as a trade and investment location for Korean business interests, and the priority we are affording to Asia through our Asia Strategy. I also took the opportunity to invite President Kim to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the conclusion of the summit, I addressed a lunch hosted by the Irish Ambassa<Col N="23" /> dor to Korea, Mr. Paul Murray. This was attended by senior representatives of the Korean business and academic community, and members of the Irish community living in Korea, including many religious members and NGOs. I took the opportunity to inform the audience of the primary objectives of Ireland's Asia Strategy, namely, the establishment of enhanced business and political links between Ireland and Asia, and the raising of awareness of Ireland as a source of high quality exports. A copy of my speech has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In recognising the excellent trade and investment links that already exist between Ireland and Korea, I highlighted the potential for further development of these relationships.</P>
    <P>I also visited a language workshop organised by MEI/Relsa, and launched a Korean language brochure on studying English in Ireland. This brochure is aimed at advising students on where they can study in Ireland, and I am delighted to inform the House that its production was partly funded by the Asia Strategy Group.</P>
    <P>The fostering of educational and cultural links between the ASEM partners is a key element of both the ASEM process and Ireland's Asia Strategy. I was delighted, therefore, to attend the signing of an agreement between Changwon University and Trinity College, Dublin. A similar agreement was signed between Changwon and Limerick University earlier this year. I was especially pleased to be able to mark the occasion of the first visit to Korea by an Irish Taoiseach by announcing the donation by the Department of Foreign Affairs of a substantial number of books to Kyung Hee University.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my thanks to President Kim for his excellent chairmanship of the ASEM Summit. I would also like to record the good will conveyed to me by the Asian leaders in relation to our recent election to the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Our success in building relations within Asia is due in large part to our Asia Strategy. For my part, I will continue to support, in concrete ways, the development of this strategy by, for example, leading a major trade mission to Japan in March next year. I am confident that by the time of the next ASEM Summit in Copenhagen in the autumn of 2002, we will have significantly deepened and strengthened our political, economic, trade and cultural relations with our Asian partners.</P>

      <P>I would be interested to know who will respond to this debate. I presume it will not be the Taoiseach but it would be a pity if the response was to be given by somebody who is not listening to it, who will come in here and read some script that was prepared before the debate <Col N="24" /> even began. Given that we, as party leaders, have taken the trouble to be here, the person who will reply to us should take the trouble to be here too, and not read a script that was probably written yesterday by somebody who is imagining what we will say without actually hearing it. We all have self-respect as party leaders. If we are having a debate it should be a debate, not a process of reading out stuff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But is he listening to the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.</P>
      <P>ASEM was very interesting. I was Taoiseach at the first meeting. The involvement of China is the most interesting aspect of ASEM. There are real concerns about the build up of military strength in east Asia. It is one part of the world in which the level of arms is increasing and there are some difficult territorial and other disputes in the area such as those between the Philippines and China, Taiwan and China and there was a difficult issue in Korea. Anything which involves China in dialogue with its neighbours reduces tension and is important for world peace. Chris Patten recently pointed out that the Second World War started in Europe but ended in Japan. If there is another world conflagration, and please God there will not be, east Asia is probably the most likely place in which it will start.</P>
      <P>I am a little disappointed by the way in which ASEM has developed since its inception. At our meeting in Bangkok we had quite an ambitious agenda of issues to be addressed. One of the most notable issues which stuck in my mind was the proposal for increased co-operation between universities. There was the suggestion that while many Asians studied in European universities, virtually no Europeans ever studied in Asian universities, and that this form of cultural colonialism was not good for Europe or Asia. This would involve significant language difficulties but it should be attempted as far as is possible. Very little progress has been made on this issue, but I welcome the announcements between Trinity College and Changwon University.</P>
      <P>The other significant omission from the agenda is the issue of greenhouse gases. China is comparatively under-developed but is developing very rapidly. If China and the rest of east Asia develop on the European model, with European levels of pollution and a European model of social engineering, the level of greenhouse gases and other pollutants produced in a developed China, as distinct from a half-developed China, will destroy the world's environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why the Taoiseach might be embarrassed about raising this subject, as Ireland has not published its greenhouse gas abatement strategy. However, on the scale of things, an <Col N="25" /> understanding between Europe, America and Asia on greenhouse gases is extremely urgent but was not dealt with at ASEM. I am not suggesting that ASEM would duplicate or replicate what has been done by other institutions. However, as it is a forum for politicians to talk politics, one of the major political issues which Asia and Europe have to deal with together is greenhouse gas abatement. This is a difficult issue in any country and it should be discussed by politicians at the highest level.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the proposed project for a Euro-Asian network for the monitoring and control of communicable diseases. I welcome this proposal as there is great concern in Ireland about strains of tuberculosis which are resistant to antibiotics. It is suggested that some of these are being introduced into Ireland by people from other countries, particularly from eastern Europe. We need to adopt a common health strategy to this issue and a common approach to the use of antibiotics.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Asian network, which is a good idea, should be extended to include eastern Europe. A Euro-Asian network on the monitoring and control of communicable diseases which does not include Russia, whose prisons are infested with tuberculosis, is not addressing the problem. The Taoiseach should give this matter his full attention.</P>
    <P>ASEM has an impressive range of meetings &ndash; ministerial, senior official and all sorts of other meetings involving officials and experts. However, there are no meetings involving parliamentarians. ASEM should have a parliamentary dimension as, ultimately, parliamentarians are the people with a mandate to do things alongside governments. A parliamentary dimension to ASEM would be useful. Such a forum might meet in the same city and at the same time as the ASEM summit itself so there would be an interaction between those with executive and parliamentary responsibilities. If we wish to promote democracy it must have a visible manifestation associated with ASEM. One way of doing so would be to have parliamentary meetings associated with the summit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Deputy Bruton's comments on ASEM which I hope will develop along the lines he proposes. I wish to focus on one aspect of ASEM which arises, in particular, from our election to the UN Security Council and is appropriate given the Taoiseach's recent return from Asia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position must be underpinned by a wider diplomatic network, particularly in Asia where we are very thin on the ground. Ireland has a very good reputation because of the impeccable reputation of our diplomatic corps in terms of their personal integrity and intellectual ability. Because of cost and other factors we are not in a position to make every appointment at ambassadorial level. For this reason, successive Governments which have tried to extend our diplomatic <Col N="26" /> network have developed the honorary consul system. This network has acted as a support for the diplomatic corps, particularly where we do not have resident embassies.</P>
    <P>As we extend our tentacles of influence across the world, and because of the need to safeguard our reputation, these appointments have always been carefully considered and the most complete investigation has always taken place before an appointment is made. I am personally aware of this process as I spent five years as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure we did it successfully in Pakistan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point. I am deeply conscious of this proud tradition and the high standards expected of our honorary consuls.</P>
      <P>It is the Opposition's job to ensure these honourable traditions are continued and to be vigilant regarding all appointments of honorary consuls. Yesterday was one such occasion when I raised the recent appointment of the honorary consul to Pakistan by way of a parliamentary question. The previous honorary consul, Dr. Nadeem Beg, resigned in 1998 having enjoyed a reputation for incorruptibility. His refusal to depart from the straight and narrow caused him problems on occasions, particularly regarding a report he produced on fraud in the Indus Bank in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Since part of his job involved the issuing of visas to Ireland and the charging of fees, Dr. Beg was most careful in his screening and accounting procedures. He introduced a rule that applications would not be accepted from travel agents who, in certain circumstances, stood to profit handsomely from the granting of visas.</P>
      <P>In his reply to my parliamentary question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, disclosed that the Irish ambassador to Pakistan, who is resident in Tehran, interviewed 12 people who had expressed an interest in or had been recommended for the position of honorary consul to Pakistan. Mr. Hasib Ahsan was duly appointed by the Government and took office earlier this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What was not disclosed in the reply to my parliamentary question yesterday are the following matters which I understand are facts. First, I understand that Mr. Ahsan is a tra<Col N="27" /> vel agent employed by American Express Travel Services. I understand the appointment of a travel agent would be a complete departure from the previous tradition, where visa applications were not even accepted from travel agents.</P>
      <P>Second, I understand that Mr. Ahsan was not the first choice recommended by our Ambassador, that in fact the recommendation for the appointment of Mr. Ahsan came from an unusual source. That recommendation came from a Member of this House, Deputy Ellis.</P>
      <P>Third, I understand that Mr. Ahsan, the person appointed by the Government as Ireland's Honorary Consul in Karachi, is a friend and associate of Mr. Sohail, who is, or certainly was, as I will explain in a moment, the chairman of the Indus Bank to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>Fourth, I understand that Deputy Ellis is, or certainly was, a director of the Indus Bank of Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Fifth, I understand that it is now alleged that the newly appointed Irish Honorary Consul to Pakistan overcharged applicants for visas, either at double or treble the rate, and that during the period from June to August upwards of £3,000 in extra charges were charged and collected by him. I further understand that that practice has now been stopped because a complaint was made directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin by letter of 8 August.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that it is my understanding that our Honorary Consul, our man in Karachi, was appointed on the recommendation of Deputy Ellis, a director of the Indus Bank, and that he is a friend of Mr. Sohail of that bank. I further understand that in recent weeks the licence of the Indus Bank has been withdrawn. It is the first time in the history of Pakistani banking that a licence has been withdrawn. Various reasons for this are quoted in the documentation in my possession but at this stage I do not want to go into them in detail other than to say that these facts indicate a very murky tale surrounding the appointment by the Government of an honorary consul in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>The circumstances, as outlined by me, require the most complete explanation from the Government of the circumstances surrounding the appointment of our Honorary Consul to Pakistan, the manner in which he has carried on his activities in the name of Ireland since his appointment and the extra charges which he made on people applying for visas. The Government has a duty and a responsibility to the country to explain the full details of this murky tale.</P>
      <P>There must be an examination by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of the circumstances surrounding this appointment and I intend to ask the committee to examine the issue, to call all necessary witnesses in order that we can get the complete story on this issue and to provide to the people of Ireland the full and unadulterated truth surrounding the appointment of our Honorary Consul in Pakistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> It is important for Ireland that we maintain the reputation for absolute integrity in the diplomatic corps. Such reputation must exist not just among the professional diplomatic corps but perhaps even more so among those people we choose to appoint as honorary consuls to act for and in the name of Ireland in other countries. When I raise in the House the suggestion that we extend our diplomatic corps, I state that any such extension must be based on those principles.</P>
    <P>The facts, as now disclosed, indicate that an appointment was made in the most suspicious circumstances. I want to know why the Government this year caused this man to be appointed as our man in Karachi and I intend, on behalf of my party and of the Opposition, to pursue this issue until we have all the facts. If the Government is not prepared to immediately disclose all those facts, I will ask the members of the Government to come before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to be cross-examined in this issue.</P>

      <P>The allegations put on the record of the House by Deputy O'Keeffe, a senior and respected Member of this House, are very serious. I urge the Taoiseach to respond to them as quickly as possible. It may not be possible in the context of this debate for him to do so, but I have known Deputy O'Keeffe for a long time, I respect his judgment and I, on behalf of the Labour Party, can say sincerely that those charges would not have been made lightly. They certainly require substantial and immediate investigation. The House in general, but certainly the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, should be informed of the nature of the appointment, the way in which it was made and if the allegations are true.</P>
      <P>On the procedure of the House, with all due respect to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, if we are to have a debate which we lightly call Statements and since the Taoiseach correctly sat through this debate, it seems that it makes more sense &ndash; although this is a procedure which existed before Deputy Ahern became the Taoiseach and therefore I am not criticising this Administration &ndash; that the person who made the initial statement to which we replied should respond. If the response to our contributions is given by somebody else, it is not the most efficient way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will comment on the Taoiseach's comprehensive report from the ASEM III Summit. Having read the chairman's report, which, in effect, as the Taoiseach stated, contains the conclusions of the gathering, there are a number of interesting issues which arise from it. First and foremost it is fair to say, as I am sure Deputy Bruton would agree, that ASEM came into existence as a welcome regional political response to the phenomenon of globalisation. We are beginning to see regional groups of states of one kind or another dealing with issues which are being thrown up by globalisation. Certainly the agenda of ASEM and the range of meetings listed in the report on the <Col N="29" /> website, which accompanied the chairman's statement, is extensive. Because of time constraints, I will address just a few of them.</P>
    <P>In the context of the alleged clash of cultures between Europe and Asia, and of the World Trade Organisation and the opening up of markets for free competition, there is an allegation, most famously made by Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, that the Asian culture, in terms of its understanding not only of the welfare state but of human rights, was different to that of Europe. Consequently matters like trades union rights, human rights and child labour were raised as a kind of reverse protectionism, where Europe was trying to impose upon Asia and emerging Asian economies standards of market behaviour and production which were, in effect, anti-competitive, and that the competitive advantage Asia possessed regarding labour costs was one which Europe was trying to overcome through the &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; argument of human rights. I reject this point of view and would like the Taoiseach or the Minister for Defence to indicate whether this was raised in any of the debates or in the free flow of discussion in Seoul at the ASEM conference.</P>
    <P>From my point of view and that of the party of European Socialists of which I am a member, the right to join a trade union and to bargain the cost and price of one's labour is not a human right, it is a market contractual right. If one takes trade union rights and puts them into the basket of human rights, one is actually failing to recognise what a free market is. If we have, under the WTO, the right to enforce contracts in relation to the sale of property, for example, or if we have, within the context of the WTO because they are seen as market rights, the right to enforce ownership of intellectual property, which used to be a great point of contention, particularly with Korea in its earlier days of development and now, and if those rights are seen as commercial rights that fall within the framework of commerce and trade, I put it to the Taoiseach that what Europe and Ireland should be arguing is that the right of workers to organise themselves to maximise the value of their commodity in the marketplace, which is their labour and their ability to sell it, is fundamentally an economic right and not a human right. The fact that in Europe the historical struggle for trade union recognition was confused with human rights obscures the essential nature of the point I am making.</P>
    <P>In essence, if we open up markets and liberalise them, then they have to be fully and completely liberalised. It is not sufficient in the context of globalisation that aspects of the market are opened up and liberalised and are enforceable and policed by international treaties such as the WTO but that other aspects of it are deemed to be not opened for liberalisation and are not, so to speak, policed by international treaties. In saying this, I am not saying that labour costs and labour standards of a European scale should be imposed on Indonesian or ASEM groups of countries. I am simply saying it is an integral part of <Col N="30" /> globalisation that Indonesian workers or any Asian workers have the right to organise themselves as they see fit. They will make the trade off between increased costs and job losses in the same way trade union leaders all over the world do.</P>
    <P>As Leader of the Labour Party and as part of the European socialists, and, indeed, the Socialist International, the American trade union movement and many others, I have been arguing for the transfer of this point of view out of the human rights basket into which it has been successfully pushed by a combination of spurious counter cultural arguments coming from some Asian leaders on the one hand and European and American right-wingers on the other. The right to organise labour and to sell it to its maximum value is as much an integral part of a liberalised market as the right to enforce contracts or to ensure the ownership of intellectual property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I would like to highlight what I said in the debate, and I know Deputy Quinn is not taking issue with me. I pointed out that Ireland and the EU were fully committed to upholding the rights of the individual and, in particular, the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, association and religion. I also had a fairly friendly but heated exchange with my Malaysian colleague and I said that we do not believe that the enjoyment of these rights is dependent on the attainment of a particular level of socio-economic development by the state but rather that they are the absolute minimum to which all humans are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification, which I welcome. I am just concerned that, in the context of opening up Europe's markets to other countries, the debate on liberalisation, which I support, and, indeed, the point that was made very strongly by President Museveni of Uganda in respect of access for agricultural products, if we are going to have globalisation, goes in both directions. In many of these countries which are not yet functioning democracies, there is a need for that point of view to be articulated but I welcome the Taoiseach's elaboration on his text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move to some of the other points I would like to raise on globalisation before I talk about some of the points the Taoiseach made in his speech. The euro has been successfully launched in Europe, although to read the Anglo-Saxon press one would think the euro was a failure. I would love to see the level of currency speculation and instability that would surround all the peripheral currencies of Europe today if we did not have EMU and if we had to face the prospect of the soaring value of the US dollar. <i>The Economist </i>of three weeks ago stated that the New Zealand dollar has dropped 44% in value reference to the US dollar since 1996 and that the Australian dollar has dropped in value by approximately 35% in the same period. It is not a question of the euro <Col N="31" /> falling <i>vis-à-vis </i>the US dollar, it is a question of the US dollar soaring<i> vis-à-vis</i> every other currency in the world.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come, within the context of ASEM, for the European Union, countries within the euro zone in particular, and the Asian countries to look for a fundamental change, since and post Bretton Woods, in the pricing of certain basic international commodities. Specifically, there is an argument for geo-political economic stability if we were to remove the monopoly of pricing that the US dollar currently possess in respect of oil and other commodities such as cotton, coffee and any other commodity traded internationally. That they are priced exclusively in US dollars is a function of history. It was, and for many it still is, the only global reserve currency. It has now been matched by the yen on the one hand and the euro on the other. There is a compelling argument in terms of geo-political exchange rate stability and from our point of view to have a barrel of oil, which is the most obvious example, and other international commodities that are traded priced in a weighted basket consisting of the euro, the yen and the US dollar, instead of being priced exclusively in US dollars which gives the United States extraordinary economic advantage.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that, in the context of the ASEM, in particular, such a rebalancing of commodity pricing is a strategic interest that should be pursued. It will not be easily yielded because the United States will not yield that dominant position readily but it is something that is in the interests of the two regions and I would like to hear the Taoiseach's comments in respect of that.</P>
    <P>I turn now to points the Taoiseach made in relation to some of the issues that surrounded the visit. I regret we are not in a position to discuss the Biarritz informal Council but I understand from what the Taoiseach said that we will hear from the Government fairly soon in the publication of a document outlining its position, which I welcome. We have been threatened from Berlin to Boston by members of this Government with debates on Europe but when they come home, they seem to be remarkably silent. Indeed, on that point, where has the Taoiseach put the Tánaiste? She has not been in the House for the last three days. I hope she is not sulking or hiding, but when she finally comes out of her purdah, perhaps we will have the debate she wants to have on Europe. However, we will have to await that for another day.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> In relation to Korea, I share the Taoiseach's diplomatically expressed words of regret that the United Kingdom, our friends, allies and neighbours, jumped the gun in the recognition of North Korea. It has some of the hallmarks of the former West Germany jumping the gun in the premature recognition of Croatia which was not helpful in the context of what subsequently happened in Yugoslavia. A long road has yet to be travelled in relation to how North Korea is brought fully and properly into the international community. I endorse and strongly support the view, if I interpreted it correctly, that the Taoiseach was diplomatically putting into the media that this is a matter in terms of common foreign and security policy. If it means anything within the European Union and if we have learned any of the lessons from Croatia and the subsequent destruction of Yugoslavia, that should be done in concert and should have been co-ordinated. If the common foreign and security policy means anything within the European Union and if we have learned any lessons from Croatia and the subsequent destruction of Yugoslavia, this is something that should be done in concert and in a co-ordinated way on the basis of collective recognition and full diplomatic participation, including perhaps resident embassies, with the full force of European support behind it, rather than having solo post-imperialist runs from dear friends and neighbours. I share the concerns expressed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Germany's experience of unification has been costly and the lessons to be learned from it are extensive. There has been some writing on the probable cost of reunification of Korea. It is probably not the Taoiseach's bedtime reading, but the New Left Review of 1995 contained an interesting article by George Habernas on the implications of unification for Germany and for Korea. As Deputy Bruton said, Korea is one of the last potential trouble spots that could trigger off a major regional, if not global, incident. Therefore, how we handle the reintegration of Korea into the world community is a particularly sensitive task and I commend the Taoiseach for the action that has been taken so far and support the view on it expressed in so far as I have read it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to his meeting with President Wahid. As reported in an article by Conor O'Cleary on 20 October, the indication given to the Taoiseach by President Wahid that he, along with Mr. Xanana Gusmao of East Timor and the UN administrator, Mr. de Mello, and possibly the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, would visit West Timor and verify a process whereby more than 100,000 East Timorese refugees, who appear to be held against their will in refugee camps in West Timor, would be interviewed or allowed individually to signal their desire to return to East Timor, has been greeted, according to Conor O'Cleary's article, with some scepticism by UN administrators in East Timor. The Taoiseach may want to clarify the reaction <Col N="33" /> of other people to that proposed process and how he assessed the seriousness or the validity or the real intent of what President Wahid&mdash;</P>

      <P>He gave me the date and the time. The only point about which he was unsure was whether John Howard would be there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification. Perhaps notwithstanding these statements, we are having the debate and getting the clarification we would have liked.</P>
      <P>For reasons many of us know but few can explain, the plight of East Timor has become extraordinarily connected to the concerns of the Irish people. I can think of no other country with the exception of perhaps Nicaragua in terms of size relative to geography that has impacted so much in terms of people's concerns. Tom Hyland as well as many others, including the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has much to do with that. Ireland as a small country with a particular history can demonstrate a presence in Asia by expressing extraordinarily strong and sustained solidarity with East Timor. It is a country wishing to become a state with none of the necessary infrastructure. The place was devastated as a result of the referendum. The Taoiseach might indicate on this occasion or at some stage in the future what type of sustained programme we could provide for East Timor having regard to our commitment to move to full compliance with UN targets by the year 2007.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach made clear in his statement, this third meeting of ASEM was a success in terms of the documents it produced and the number of practical initiatives it endorsed in areas of interest or concern to both sides. The follow up meetings and seminars, which these initiatives will now require, will provide further and expanding synergy, which will bring into contact <Col N="34" /> with each other many further elements of our respective Administrations, not to speak of representatives of other sectors. This will lead to further co-operation and a deepened understanding to strengthen the common purpose of both sides. In addition the free flowing nature of the discussions between the heads of State and the Government not only allowed them to understand each other's positions better but provided wide areas of agreement that will further the process.</P>
    <P>The occasion also provided for Ministers or their representatives to engage in parallel discussions on matters such as developments in the Korean peninsula and UN peacekeeping, the latter area is one on which there is also greater common concern and greater involvement by a number of Asian countries. Given the extent of our experience in UN peacekeeping, this provided an opportunity for us to share some insights into our experiences.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Bruton's comments on the educational exchanges, all present recognised there was a defect that should be addressed. The vision group proposes a target of a fivefold increase in such exchanges before 2020. While the summit did not set targets, this is the goal we are keeping in mind.</P>
    <P>With regard to greenhouse gases and the environment generally, several speakers addressed the importannce of The Hague follow up to Kyoto and the importance of early ratification of SEECO. As yet the ASEM process does not have a parliamentary tier. It may well develop one in that way, but I remind the Deputy that the ASEM process is one which only moves by consensus. The Deputy's suggestion is one we will continue to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Regarding the points made by Deputy O'Keeffe, I do not have details with me which would enable me to reply fully to his comments. I have noted what he said and will examine it. Pakistan is not a member of ASEM.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be seriously addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Comments were made about what we have done about the establishment of embassies and contacts in other places. Since we came back to power, an embassy has been opened in Singapore and consulates have been established in Shanghai and in Sydney. In addition, extra consulate posts have been established and filled in the embassies in Beijing and Tokyo. Enterprise Ireland has joined the consulates in Sydney and Shanghai in an Ireland House arrangement and the Enterprise Ireland representative in Beijing will function from that embassy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Quinn's points on the World Trade Organisation, international labour standards did not arise in Seoul. The main thrust of the exchanges was an urgent need to kickstart <Col N="35" /> the WTO process, with both sides recognising that an early restart of a comprehensive and inclusive new round within the WTO following the fiasco in Seattle is of the utmost importance. Negotiations are ongoing in Geneva concerning the terms of the new round. The points made by the Deputy are among those currently under discussion and negotiation there.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Quinn's comments on the price of oil and the dollar. We had exchanges in Seoul on the price of oil because of its global importance, but it is not clear whether ASEM is the forum in which to debate the suggestions made. There was a general feeling in Seoul that achieving a stable price in oil was a priority not just for ASEM but for the world as a whole and poorer countries in particular.</P>
    <P>The documents produced by the summit indicate the range of topics covered and the Taoiseach has already mentioned this. I emphasise the three separate pillars which the ASEM talks addressed and which made the summit interesting and important &ndash; political co-operation, economic and financial co-operation as well as cultural education and co-operation between people. Taken together, these strands provide a comprehensive framework for intensified and deepened co-operation between Europe and the Asian countries in ASEM in the years to come.</P>
    <P>By some calculations the ten Asian countries involved will, in 20 years, equal or exceed the combined economic output of Europe and America. Even if this proves not to be the case it will still prove to be a huge and important bloc accounting for a quarter of the world's population and a quarter of its trade at present as well as a proven track record of economic growth over the past two decades. Several of the countries have also achieved impressive rises in living and health standards over that period, with the number of people classified as poor in the ten countries declining sharply since 1975.</P>
    <P>The ASEM process is important because it brings together the leaders of Europe with the emerging and established economies of Asia in an informal setting which encourages frank exchanges of views. This is of considerable importance in the areas of human rights, democracy and security. It is also important for the future in that of its very nature it is forward-looking and because each summit has sought to encourage deeper and more intensive co-operation between the countries involved, which account for approximately half of the world's economic activity.</P>
    <P>The exchanges at ASEM III look to the future, as do the initiatives adopted. There were valuable exchanges on the major issues likely to dominate the 21st century &ndash; globalisation, e-commerce, the information society and the so-called digital divide &ndash; and also on how to assist the poor of the world to participate in the technological knowledge-based revolution. ASEM has also agreed an initiative designed to grapple with some of the <Col N="36" /> unsavoury aspects of globalisation such as transnational crime, trafficking in women and children, drugs and the spread of worldwide contagious diseases.</P>
    <P>Throughout the proceedings in Seoul there was a clear recognition that the countries assembled owe a responsibility to the poor and less fortunate of the world to help them towards a better future. The ASEM process is also important to Ireland; as the Taoiseach said, we have signalled our interest in Asia with the adoption of a major strategy last year and we have expanded our diplomatic and trade representation in the countries in Asia participating in ASEM. Therefore, at the time Ireland is poised to join the Security Council we will be in a position to intensify our links bilaterally in both the political and economic spheres in these countries. Foreign Ministers are being tasked to look at ASEM and make recommendations as to how its work might be improved and our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will participate in these deliberations with a view to reporting to heads of Government at the next ASEM summit in Copenhagen in 2002.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Quinn's comment about East Timor, I could not agree more with the necessity to try to help in every way we can. The Taoiseach and I visited East Timor and saw at first hand the work of our troops there. One could not come away without a sense of purpose to do more. An incident that will be forever in my mind relates to a school in a little village in the mountains where there were 50 children, one teacher, one chair and no desks, pencils, books, pictures or crayons. There was nothing. We were fortunate that we could respond to that need through my Department, but it highlights the deprivation these diminutive people, for all their capacity to withstand struggle, have suffered. The militia tore down the electricity wires on their way back to Indonesia, leaving areas without power, yet these people display huge courage in the face of having lost one third of their population in the last 24 years. In consultation with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs I will undertake to see to what extent more can be done within the limits and demands that are there. It is a special case as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Regarding diplomatic relations with North Korea, it is, as Deputy Quinn suggested, desirable to have this matter dealt with in a co-ordinated way within the CFSP and we will endeavour to see that that is done.</P>

      <P>This Bill presents major difficulty for the Dáil whether the Dáil knows it or not. I will try to acquaint the House with some of the issues.</P>
      <P>The problems relating to the Bill persist even after lengthy sessions during the Joint Committee on the Bill and in the Seanad. It has been amended 20 times already and some of these amendments were major ones, including changes in the Long and Short Titles of the Bill. The first and most important problem is that the time which the promoters of this Bill had under the Universities Act, 1997, to secure its passage through the Oireachtas expired on 16 June last. Also, the Bill was improperly notified to the Oireachtas by parliamentary notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>on 14 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The ballot of the body corporate promoting the Bill, namely the Provost, fellows and scholars, closed at the close of business on 21 November 1997 and could not, therefore, be relied on to support the parliamentary notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 14 November, a full week earlier. The ballot which closed on 21 November 1997 was improperly conducted and a second ballot was ordered by the college visitors with a closing date of 7 February 1998. The only meeting of the body corporate of the Provost, fellows and scholars to discuss the Bill took place on 26 January 1998 and that took place only because the visitors ordered that such a meeting take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In placing their Bill before the Dáil today, the promoters rely on the results of the first ballot and on the only notice that appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, namely, the one which appeared on 14 November 1997. The promoters could have validly included their parliamentary notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> only after the second ballot, and that is assuming they had obtained a sufficient majority therein. The second ballot was held on 7 Febru<Col N="38" /> ary 1998 and the earliest notice that could have appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>would, therefore, have been in the issue of Friday, 11 February 1998.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas and the Private Bills Office were not made aware by the promoters of the Bill of the difficulties and irregularities which it encountered during the period between 14 November 1997 and February 1998 in respect of the parliamentary notice, the ballot malpractices, the two ballots and the late meeting of the body corporate. This information, if it had been available, would have assisted the Private Bills Office and the Oireachtas in dealing with the Bill. However, it was only following cross-examination on 21 September 1999 that Members became fully aware of these problems.</P>
    <P>The 75% support requirement under the Standing Orders of the Oireachtas and company law was not attained in either the November 1997 or the February 1998 ballots. The support gained was 68% and 72%, respectively. The senate of the University of Dublin was not consulted and never met on the matter, despite historic precedents in 1873 and 1907, a requirement to do so in section 64 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and a statement in one of the recitals in the preamble to the Bill to the effect that it was being presented and promoted at the request of the university. I will now try to deal with these different sets of difficulties and irregularities in turn.</P>
    <P>The time which the promoters were given under the Universities Act, 1997, to have this Bill passed through the Oireachtas has expired since 16 June last. Section 4(2) of the Universities Act, 1997, states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sections 16(1) to (7), 21(6), 22, 23, 32</i> and <i>33</i> shall not apply to or in relation to Trinity College unless the Minister, by order made not earlier than three years after the commencement of <i>Part lll</i>, declares that those provisions apply, in which case they shall apply as if a reference to the commencement of <i>Part lll</i> were a reference to the date on which the order came into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not make an order under <i>subsection (2)</i> if within the period of three years referred to in that subsection a Private Act is passed by the Oireachtas amending, in a manner consistent with the purpose and substance of the sections mentioned in that subsection, the charters and letters patent under which Trinity College and the University of Dublin are incorporated.</P>
    <P>The Bill has not complied with the requirement of being &ldquo;a Private Act&rdquo; passed within three years by the Oireachtas &ldquo;amending . the charters and letters patent under which Trinity College and the University of Dublin are incorporated&rdquo; because the time has expired. There has been no consultation with the University of Dublin, where the university senate is a separate body corporate <Col N="39" /> and the requirements of the Universities Act have, therefore, not been met.</P>
    <P>The Title of the Bill had to be changed by the Seanad because a body listed in the original Title, the University of Dublin, and in section 4 of the Universities Act, as cited above, had not been consulted. It took several strenuous sessions of cross-examination to secure evidence of the many malpractices associated with this and the full extent of the irregularities was apparent only when the Joint Committee completed its work on 1 March 2000.</P>
    <P>The Bill, accordingly, appears to have little or no legal effect. The current Minister for Education and Science or his successors will be free to disregard this Bill, even if it is passed, and apply the terms of the Universities Act, 1997, as they see fit, notwithstanding this Bill. The House is, therefore, engaged today in a futile exercise. In my view it should not stultify itself by so doing.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary notice in<i> Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 14 November 1997 stated that &ldquo;pursuant to the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad relative to Private business, the Board of Trinity College, Dublin, together with the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin, intend to apply for leave to bring in a Private Bill to amend the Charters and Letters Patent of the College entitled as above.&rdquo;  The ballot of the body corporate promoting the Bill jointly with the board of Trinity College, namely, the Provost, fellows and scholars, closed at the close of business on 21 November 1997 and could not have been used to support the parliamentary notice of 14 November 1997. At that time, the ballot on the Bill had over a week to run before the closing date of the poll on 21 November. No valid result of this ballot could have been known until late on 21 November.</P>
    <P>The ballot which closed on 21 November 1997 was improperly conducted and a second ballot was ordered by the visitors &ndash; the chancellor and a judge of the Supreme Court &ndash; with a closing date of 7 February 1998. The ballot which was counted on 21 November 1997 was improperly conducted. On or before 13 November, the returning officer, the vice-provost, opened the returned ballots. The system was an assent system. Those who approved returned their assent forms which were signed and placed in a designated identified envelope and returned to the returning officer, the vice-provost. Those who did not agree with the Bill did not return the assent form.</P>
    <P>The vice-provost opened the ballot envelopes some nine days before the close of the ballot. He checked the names of the respondents against the register of electors and noted the names of several non-respondents. He then e-mailed, at 17.21 on Thursday, 13 November, this information to his daughter. He asked her to seek a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote from those whose names he had extracted from the electoral register. She, in turn, e-mailed named scholars on Monday, 17 November at <Col N="40" /> 11.40 a.m. Her covering note to the e-mail mentioned that here were several others whose e-mail addresses she did not have.</P>
    <P>The text of the vice-provost's daughter's e-mail reads &ldquo;Got an e-mail from my Dad which he wants passed on to you guys (among others whose addresses I don't have).&rdquo;  The remainder of the e-mail simply re-transmits the vice-provost's e-mail of the previous Thursday, which reads:</P>
    <P>Dear [name of daughter], a strange request: College is at present in the process of trying to get approval from the body corporate (viz. the Provost, Fellows and Foundation Scholars) for the promotion of a Private Bill through the Dáil to do with necessary changes in the composition of the Board. What is needed is for members of the body corporate individually to assent (on an assent form) to the Bill. At the moment we are a good few short of a majority of the body corporate assenting, and could do with every assent that comes in.</P>
    <P>All members of the body corporate will have received a copy of the Private bill and an assent form for signature. A reminder has gone out and the latest date for return of assents is Friday 21st November.</P>
    <P>Could you contact a few of your cronies who, I know, have not responded. I am not supposed to be putting any pressure on them to sign, [which was a very nice thing for the returning officer to say] but simply remind them how urgent it is that they decide, and not let the thing go by default. There are too many Fellows who simply ignore it all, and it would be good if the Foundation Scholars could show them up. Anyway there has been no response from the following foundation scholars [he provides a list of names]. If you have e-mail addresses for any or all of them, would you get after them and tell them (a) to decide, (b) to tell anyone they can think of of the urgency of the situation, and (c) that their assents are required by 21st November at the latest &ndash; they should, if necessary send their assents by courier and College will refund the expenses.</P>
    <P>Some of the students who objected to the e-mail published it in the TCD student press and it was widely known in the college. The conduct of the ballot should seriously concern the Dáil. The ballot concerned legislation which we are asked to endorse here but I believe the Dáil cannot endorse the way the ballot was conducted.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the parliamentary notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was required in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> office by 14.00 hours on 13 November, the day before publication. The e-mail to the vice provost's daughter was sent at 17.21 hours the same day. Within a few hours of notifying the Oireachtas by parliamentary notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that there was a majority in favour of the Private Bill, the vice provost e-mailed to his daughter that, &ldquo;at the moment we are a good few <Col N="41" /> short of a majority of the body corporate assenting&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is the Dáil to believe? No valid result of the ballot could have been known until the close of business on 21 November and no parliamentary notice could have been validly published until the following Tuesday, 25 November. As the visitors subsequently required a second ballot to close on Monday, 7 February, no parliamentary notice could have relied on the first ballot. A parliamentary notice relying on the second ballot could not have been published until the following Friday, 11 February.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the provost, fellows and scholars, who are the body corporate promoting the Bill with the board of Trinity College, to discuss the Bill took place on 26 January 1998, long after all the notices had gone out and the Bill had been lodged. I believe this meeting only took place because it was ordered by the visitors, the then Chancellor, Dr. Frank O'Reilly and Mr. Justice Henry Barron, who was then a judge of the Supreme Court. It was the only meeting of the body corporate to discuss a Bill which had already been notified to the Oireachtas some ten weeks earlier. The Bill was, therefore, not lodged as lines 40 and 41 of the preamble state, &ldquo;with the consent of the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of the said College&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In placing their Bill before the Dáil today, the promoters wrongly rely on the first flawed ballot and on the premature notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. TCD relies on the first ballot, which includes the malpractices rejected by the visitors, when they ordered a second ballot. TCD also relies on the parliamentary notice of 14 November which cannot be valid. It appeared before the result of the first ballot was known on 21 November. It also appeared before the meeting of the body corporate on 26 January and before the second ballot which closed on 7 February.</P>
    <P>Because of the flaws in the first ballot, a second was ordered by the visitors. Despite the visitors' order for a second ballot, the promoters ignored its significance. The college ignored the second ballot's consequences for the Bill. The Private Bills Office and the Examiner of Private Bills were not notified and a parliamentary notice was not placed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas and the Private Bills Office did not know of the difficulties and improprieties such as the incorrect parliamentary notice, the opening of the ballot papers before the close of the ballot, the misuse of the information gained from opening the ballot papers, the e-mailing by the returning officer, the requirement of a second ballot, the requirement for a meeting of the body corporate and the requirement to launch the Bill after the 7 February ballot. The Oireachtas and its officials only became fully aware of these problems almost two years later when the joint committee cross-examination of the returning officer, the then vice provost, took place on 21 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The work of the Private Bills Office took place <Col N="42" /> without knowledge of the above facts. The Bill should properly have been lodged only when the full requirements of the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad for Private Bills had been complied with. When the promoter of a Private Bill fails to supply information to the Oireachtas and publishes parliamentary notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which could not have been true at the time, such malpractices must be remedied. This has not happened. The way to remedy the irregularities would have been to withdraw the Bill and start all over again, observing the rules the second time round. That did not happen.</P>
    <P>The support obtained for the Bill was 68% in the first ballot and 72% in the second ballot, even though there is a requirement under both the Companies Acts and Standing Orders for a 75% majority. There was communication of the failure to obtain the majority by way of a 'phone call by the college secretary to the Private Bills Office according to his evidence under cross-examination at the joint committee on 7 November 1999. That failure was dealt with by a committee which did not hear the petitioner against the Bill, nor did it give reasons for its decision. Together with the other abuses of which the committee was not yet aware, the waiving of the 75% requirement was in these circumstances a serious blow to the petitioner against the Bill.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Private Bills, the Oireachtas acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. Rules such as hearing both parties, giving reasons for decisions and no person acting as a judge in his own case are important. There is the added problem that our decisions probably are not justiciable and that the courts will not hear cases against them except in so far as passed legislation infringes the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to give fair play to both the promoters of and petitioners against Private Bills. The problem is made more difficult when the promoters of and petitioners against Private Bills have legal representation and advice, but the joint committee did not have such assistance. The Dáil should be aware of the problems encountered uniquely in this case of a contested Private Bill, which is a relative rarity. I do not recall one previously in my 33 years in this House. I do not think there has been a contested Private Bill since the 1920s.</P>
    <P>The Senate of the University of Dublin is a body corporate comprising the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters of the University, established under Letters Patent of 1857. Dr. Mary Robinson is the present Chancellor. I understand this body corporate has almost 600 members. That is approximately twice the size of the college body corporate of provost, fellows and scholars.</P>
    <P>The college sought to remove one reference to the university in an amendment proposed to the joint committee on 15 February last to delete the words &ldquo;University of Dublin&rdquo; from lines 36 and 37 of the preamble to the Bill. The joint committee refused to delete the words &ldquo;University of Dublin&rdquo; from lines 36 and 37 of the Preamble to <Col N="43" /> the Bill because the Bill should also have had all such references removed, and there were many references to the University of Dublin in it. The Seanad subsequently removed the references by the several amendments made throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The college admitted in cross-examination of its witnesses, at a very late stage, that it had not consulted the university in bringing forward the Bill. Notwithstanding that, the Bill contained an untrue recital that it was presented and promoted at the request of the university. The response of deleting all references to the University of Dublin does not relieve the promoters of seeking the approval of the Senate of the university. That duty is based on two historic precedents and in legislation, in section 64 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. The historic cases are the meetings of the Senate held in 1873 to oppose and protest against the Irish Universities Bill introduced by Mr. Gladstone in that year, which ultimately was defeated and which brought down the then British Government, and again in 1907, when Campbell Bannerman was Prime Minister, to protest against the proposed Irish Universities Act, which was subsequently passed in 1908 but which in the event, apparently because of the intervention of the university senate, did not apply to TCD. The vice-chancellors who presided at these meetings were eminent legal figures, Charles Napier in 1873 and Digby Madden in 1907. Both became Attorneys General.</P>
    <P>Section 64 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 provides:</P>
    <P>No law shall have the effect of diminishing the effect so as to alter the constitution or divert the property of, or repeal or diminish any existing exemption or immunity enjoyed by the University of Dublin, or Trinity College, Dublin..unless and until the proposed alteration, diversion, repeal or diminution is approved: &ndash;</P>
    <P>in the case of the University of Dublin, or Trinity College, Dublin, by the majority of those present and voting at a meeting of each of the following bodies convened for the purpose, namely, the governing body of the college, and the junior fellows and professors voting together, and the University Council and the Senate.</P>
    <P>A recent commentary on the Universities Act, 1997 cites a reference to the senate of the University of Dublin from an appendix to the second report of the Royal Commission on University Education in 1902:</P>
    <P>. . . though therefore the Senate is not a governing Senate, does not appoint examiners, does not fix the books, does not in any way manage Trinity College, it has the power of veto by which the whole College could be brought to a deadlock tomorrow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> That is cited in Irish Current Law Statutes, annotated 1997-1998; examination of the Universities Act, 1997. The case could, therefore, be made that the senate of the University of Dublin should have been consulted on matters relating to Trinity College and that is recognised by the fact that the Bill originally contained a recital that it had and also because it is enshrined in law and it happened during previous debates on Irish universities legislation.</P>
    <P>A request by a member of the senate of the university to have a debate on both the Universities Bill and the TCD Private Bill was refused by the Registrar, Professor Mayes, in a letter dated 23 October 1996. A further point concerning the University of Dublin is that it is a way in which graduates can express their opinions. There are no graduates as such on the TCD Board compared to four under the Universities Act in the case of other colleges. TCD currently has some 35,000 graduates in the State and many more outside of it.</P>
    <P>Like medical politics, academic politics is sometimes quite vicious.</P>

      <P>Even the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might agree with me on that. I have found myself the subject of some very vituperative comments, publicly and privately, in the Seanad and elsewhere because I had the temerity to challenge some of what was going on. The worst sanction of all was imposed on me. A professor in the University of Dublin wrote a letter of complaint about me to the leader of my party and asked her to bring me to heel. In the course of this he said that &ldquo;the only construction one can put on the O'Malley move is some deeper hostility or jealousy arising from the thinking of the Tierney/McQuaid era and their systematic attempt to downgrade and eventually abolish the college&rdquo;. That caused me to contemplate my relationship with Dr. McQuaid and Dr. Tierney. In each case I found myself considerably at odds with them. I was almost thrown out of UCD for challenging some decisions Dr. Tierney had made and I had great difficulties with Dr. McQuaid on at least two occasions when I was Minister for Justice, the details of which I will not go into. Because I did not favour either of the men I am accused now of following and being dictated to by, it occurred to me that the House might be interested in an entry to a literary competition in <i>The Irish Times</i> held at the time the ban was removed from Trinity which was early in the seventies. The literary editor at the time was Terence de Vere White. He agreed that the following entry was the best and should get the prize but because he would have to publish it in order to give it the prize, he could not do so. He was afraid to publish it. The author of it gave it to me but <Col N="45" /> asked me not to mention his authorship even at this stage. It reads:</P>
      <P>Said Archbishop McQuaid in a Lenten tirade:</P>
      <P>You may rob and may loot</P>
      <P>You may murder and shoot</P>
      <P>You may even have carnal knowledge;</P>
      <P>But if you want to be saved and not be depraved</P>
      <P>You must stay out of Trinity College.</P>
      <P>I thought it appropriate to put that on the record to show that some of those who were so antagonistic towards me got it wrong.</P>

      <P>The circumstances under which this Bill has been brought forward and has had a tortuous passage of nearly three years, and will now have no effect, is something the House should be aware of. I do not propose to call a vote on this as I do not believe a matter as local and relatively insignificant in public terms as the internal difficulties of Trinity College should delay this House for whatever length of time it takes to have a vote. However, I do not want anyone in the future to say 166 Deputies approved of this. I dissent from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Malley. He did us all some service by putting that piece of doggerel poetry on the record after all these years. The complexities he has outlined arise from the impenetrable nature of an extraordinary Elizabethan statute  &ndash; I am speaking about Elizabeth I &ndash; which is the basis on which Trinity College, Dublin and Dublin university, the twin universities, are built. It is extraordinary that this arcane legislation should have taken up so much time of the Houses and a joint committee. Deputy O'Malley omitted to mention that our debates and considerations on this matter commenced with a long recital in doggerel Latin and, appropriately, ended with consideration of a leaky e-mail process, which indicates something of the nature of TCD, Dublin University and the period it has spanned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original status and the rules which present the difficulty in this case were drafted when the fellows and scholars of Trinity College could be accommodated in a relatively small room. At that time the twin universities did not have 35,000 graduates scattered to the four corners of the earth. Allied to this is the fact that the figure mentioned is based on an assent ballot by which someone who has disappeared, is living at a different address or paying a visit to the far reaches of Mongolia and cannot be contacted is regarded as having a negative view of the proposition. The ballots which were held, imperfect though they may have been, yielded an assent of <Col N="46" /> 68% and 72% from those people who troubled themselves to return the assent forms. If any leader or ex-leader of a political party in this State could return similar levels of support for a proposition, even one as maimed as this one, we would be very happy.</P>
    <P>The difficulties and irregularities mentioned in Deputy O'Malley's colourful and not inaccurate contribution were ventilated at a series of tortuous meetings of the joint committee. His speech illustrates the arcane nature of private business. Deputy O'Malley will support me when I say that even if Members wished to absent themselves from the committee for a call of nature, and occasionally for a call of nature necessitated not by bodily functions imparted by our creator but by the requirement of having a quick drag, it was necessary to suspend the entire meeting. That situation was ludicrous.</P>

      <P>The difficulties colourfully and not incaccurately outlined by Deputy O'Malley illustrate the extraordinarily arcane nature of private business. There were difficulties. The ballot papers were opened and the e-mail was sent. Deputy O'Malley is probably the only Member of this House who is so pure that he is offended by the idea of canvassing support for a particular viewpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will acquaint Deputy O'Malley privately with my views on some returning officers and how they operate. If there was a sin it was one of naivety to expect that foundation scholars and other highly principled people would not leak such a titillating piece of gossip.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the petitioner's initial request to the official of these Houses who handled the Bill that it be heard at an early stage and to the refusal of that request. That happened. However, the impression should not be given that the petitioner was prevented from ventilating his views, at tedious length, before the committee. He was fully facilitated in that regard. When the committee was voting on the Bill we realised that, because of the arcane nature of the rules, the petitioner could be visited with all the costs of the legislation. We set the precedent that we would vote on the issue and made a decision which was entirely supportive of the right of the petitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been amended in the Seanad. I supported the Seanad amendment in the commit<Col N="47" /> tee. It was rejected by Deputy O'Malley because of imperfections in the Title and I understand that. The amendments which were moved in the Seanad have addressed many of the imperfections in the original Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because the matter has gone far enough. It has become a piece of academic high farce. We should not take an undue amount of time debating it and I am pleased that Deputy O'Malley, having placed his views on the record of the House and condemned himself either to eternal damnation or exclusion forever from the Buttery, is not asking for a division.</P>
    <P>I have no personal interest in Trinity College, having attended a much more godly institution, as did the Acting Chairwoman, who was one of my finer students for many years. The arguments made against the Bill were an academic molehill converted into a Himalayan mountain. Dr. Barrett, who made his views known, has ventilated his spleen with his colleagues in Trinity College.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley I will put some personal reminiscences on the record. I have one brother who is a medical graduate of Trinity College. He went there when the ban was still in place. My dear mother, a devout Catholic, was asked by a neighbour who was an even more devout Catholic how Declan had got permission to study medicine, of all things, in Trinity College. My mother replied that she had not asked Dr. McQuaid for permission because he was clearly too busy since returning from the Vatican Council to be bothered and confused by such a request. Declan graduated very happily from Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College is in my constituency. It is a major institution in this country and in international education and culture is on a par with a small number of colleges. I am happy to support the modernisation of its board and the way in which the new board will be constructed. May I speak for someone who lost her seat in the last election and who, no doubt, will return from the <Col N="48" /> constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown after the next general election? Bearing in mind the grief that Niamh Bhreathnach suffered from within the halls of Trinity College when she attempted to introduce this legislation, the abuse heaped upon her and the accusation that it was an attempted State takeover of a hallowed institution which was so pure that the grubby interference of politicians, of whatever hue, would sully its academic virginity, if not purity, the shenanigans, not disputed by Deputy Roche, which have been recorded eloquently and humourously but nevertheless poignantly by Deputy O'Malley, need to be stated. We will not oppose the Bill because we are in favour of the modernisation of the structure of the board and the representation it reflects. The Bill will finally bring to the board an academic structure similar to other colleges.</P>
    <P>We support this, but it should be understood by those involved in moving this legislation from its starting position when abuse was hurled at my colleague and friend, the then Labour Party Minister for Education and Science, that when Trinity College comes to talk to Ministers and politicians in the future we will know how they conducted their business on this issue.</P>

      <P>I express a localised interest in the Bill in the sense that the esteemed Provost of Trinity College is a native of my part of the country. We are very proud of this fact. Provost Mitchell has had a significant impact in Trinity College and internationally since his appointment.</P>
      <P>I recall very well the difficulties the former Minister for Education and Science, Niamh Bhreathnach, encountered when she attempted to include Trinity College in a universities Bill. It is my understanding that permission was given to introduce a Private Bill provided it was introduced within a certain time frame. That has not happened. I find Deputy O'Malley's long sketch extraordinary, if these events are true and remain unchallenged.</P>

      <P>If it is the case that the Bill has been debated for many hours in the Seanad, joint committee and Dáil in the knowledge that affairs have been improperly conducted, this leaves questions for us to answer.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate in the Seanad Members referred to the Latin translation in various parts of the Bill, to Elizabeth I, Elizabeth II and to de Valera shoving things in the dustbin for his own reasons after the abdication of Edward VIII.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a very archaic way of doing business. In a previous Private Bill Lord Altamont arranged to pass on his property in Westport to his daughters. Having tried every other legal means he was <Col N="49" /> advised by the late Michael Joe Egan, whom he described as a country solicitor, that it was possible to bring a Private Bill before the Dáil and Seanad to do what was necessary, but there were three general elections and the Bill had to be reintroduced on each occasion. Lord Altamont was in a state of trauma about whether it would ever be enacted.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of Trinity College, the change in membership of the board may be dramatic in that heretofore members have been either fellows or appointed internally. It is my understanding that the membership numbers have now been agreed. We have no wish, therefore, to obstruct the Bill unduly, except to say that what Deputy O'Malley had to say warrants a second reading. If it remains unchallenged that there has been improper conduct, it is a clear signal that the House should do its business in a different manner and the method by which Private Bills are introduced should be updated. There will always be a small number of cases in which Private Bills will be required, but if their objectives have to be achieved by such a torturous process, perhaps the method by which legislation is introduced should be looked at seriously with a view to reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss De Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill with a simple purpose. As is the norm for Exchequer funded State bodies, a statutory ceiling is set on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities which the body may incur. This must be updated by the Houses of the Oireachtas every three to five years. The Irish Film Board Act, 1997, increased the ceiling from £15 million to £30 million. This will be reached before the end of the year because of the strong Government commitment to the film sector and the greatly increased activity of the board. I intend to accelerate still further the pace of development by providing substantially increased resources for the board in coming years. The Bill proposes to raise the ceiling on authorised issues from £30 million to £80 million, an increase of £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the growing importance of the creative audio-visual production sector for our cultural expression and economic prosperity, I established the film industry strategic review group in 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Ossie Kilkenny to review progress in the sector and make recommendations for its further <Col N="50" /> development as we face into the early years of the new millennium. The review group submitted its report in August 1999. It recommended a strengthened, broadened, restructured board to address the new strategic goals of the industry focusing on script development; development and production finance; strategic business development; generic marketing of Irish films, cinema going and video rentals; promotion of Ireland as a film location; training and development; production expertise; technological policy, development and foresight; co-ordination with the television broadcasting sector, and Irish language television production.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a strategic plan for the industry closely based on the conclusions of the strategic report. I have, accordingly, reviewed the resources of personnel, current funding and organisation required by the board for the expanded scope recommended for it in the review group report. In this process my Department engaged management consultants to review the organisation and management of the board. They reported during the summer whereupon I invited Mr. Kilkenny who had earlier been appointed by me to the position of chairman of the Irish Film Board to draw up a plan of action based on the review group's recommendations and taking into account the report of the management consultants. The board is finalising its plan for the next five years to push the industry forward into a more mature phase of expansion and commercial viability in this new decade.</P>
    <P>In the first phase from the early 1990s there was a particular emphasis on attracting large international productions to use Ireland as a location to build and sustain the production infrastructure and develop the skills base as indigenous production was insufficient to support the infrastructure and skills which are essential to the industry. Incoming productions will remain essential to the further growth of the industry. The time is now ripe, however, to look to a scaling up of our domestic production companies. To help in the achievement of this the Government is fostering a favourable environment for long-term business planning and investment in the industry by a strategic approach to the development of the industry; a five year extension of section 481; increased funding for the Irish Film Board; Enterprise Ireland support for company development, and continuing support for training.</P>
    <P>During the 1990s we built a film production infrastructure in Ireland consisting of skills, facilities and creative talent. Ireland now has the highest per capita output of feature films in the EU, and ranks fourth internationally in attracting inward investment. Where do we go from here?</P>
    <P>The digital age poses new challenges and opportunities. In the evolving digital marketplace, while continuing to gain strength in cinema and television, companies in Ireland will need to seize the opportunities of diversification of the distribution channels, the emergence of global niche markets and increased competition to win <Col N="51" /> audiences. In the digital age, content is king. Supporting the development of creative skills and production capability is a vital counterpoint to the development of the digital technology and telecommunications industry in Ireland and to the promotion of Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>We need focused business discipline and planning to achieve the emergence of strong, creative, strategically managed companies able to attract the capital resources to develop and produce slates of projects which will appeal to global markets. Audiovisual production is a powerful means of bringing Irish creativity to global audiences. It generates an awareness of and interest in our culture; supports a world-wide sense of Irish cultural identity; complements our international trade promotion and marketing; develops businesses based on intellectual property; and encourages tourism. All EU countries recognise the importance of this sector and the EU Commission recognises the special cultural significance of creative audiovisual production in its state aid rules, allowing more generous support to this sector than to other industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government's position, therefore, is that the audiovisual production industry is to be assigned a central place in Ireland's industrial policy. The Irish Film Board will co-ordinate with the industrial agencies of the State in the development of the industry and in particular in fostering strong indigenous companies in the sector. Liaison will take place at top executive level in the organisations concerned to co-ordinate support for the sector. The board's forthcoming five year plan, Strategy and Structure 2001-2005, will set out clearly how it proposes to respond to this challenge.</P>
    <P>Project development, from concept through script, market planning, financing the project and the attachment of actors and crew is the phase in which key creative and business decisions are taken, decisions which can determine the market potential of the project. The board will increase its commitment to enhancing the development process. Through an enhanced development loan scheme it will encourage companies to develop beyond the subsistence, single project mode of operation through growth and partnership; provide funding for companies to develop slates of projects, usually three to five projects, so that development becomes an ongoing function; and nurture new talent and creative originality by continuing to support the development of individual projects. There will be a closer integration of training in script writing and script development with the development support provided by the board. This should increase our capacity to produce excellent scripts which can appeal to international markets.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the second change of emphasis which will take place in the board's policies. Our capacity to communicate our culture and creativity in the audiovisual media depends on our ability to reach wider audiences. Audiovisual pro<Col N="52" /> duction is highly capital intensive and, therefore, must have regard to the market.</P>
    <P>Section 481 and the Irish Film Board schemes are there to facilitate growth and consolidation of companies and the parallel development of a pool of creative, business and production skills. Therefore, every company which applies for support from the board should have a strategic business plan stating what goals it seeks to achieve, what partners it needs to achieve these goals, and the timeframe for their achievement. Practical advice and assistance will be organised to help companies to develop their strategic thinking and plans and the board will place a greater emphasis on the commercial potential of the projects which it supports, seeing them as the basis for helping businesses to grow and their potential to contribute to the achievement of the company's business plan.</P>
    <P>I want at this point to refer to the extremely important issue of funding to support the training needs of the film and television production sector. Screen Training Ireland, the agency for film and television training, operates as a national training committee under the aegis of FÁS. Up to the end of 1999, the European Social Fund co-funded the operations of Screen Training Ireland to the tune of 75%, the balance of 25% being provided by the Exchequer through the Irish Film Board. FÁS supplemented this total from its own funds. Now, however, the ESF funding is no longer available for film training. I have, therefore, provided additional capital resources to the Irish Film Board to ensure the continuation of the vital training inputs necessary for the development and expansion of the industry. In providing these funds for training to Screen Training Ireland, and in accordance with my strategic policy for the industry, I expect the Irish Film Board to ensure, in close liaison with FÁS, that the training being delivered is consistent with the strategic needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>An important change will be that the screen commission function of the board will now operate integrally within the new, strengthened board. The Screen Commission of Ireland, established in 1997 as a statutory committee of the Irish Film Board, on a pilot basis under the direction of a voluntary panel of industry experts, became operational in 1998 as soon as funding was made available. It was to be operationally independent of the Irish Film Board and it established a separate identity, executive and office.</P>
    <P>Whereas the board's focus was on the fostering of indigenous projects and talent, the focus of the screen commission was seen as bringing mobile international projects to Ireland. It represented Ireland at major locations, the principal film markets in Europe and North America and it participated in trade missions to Australia and Canada. As a consequence, several projects came to Ireland or seriously considered Ireland as a location, and business contacts were established. However, in the light of the Film Industry Strategic Review Group's report, which recommends <Col N="53" /> an enhanced central co-ordinating role for the Irish Film Board, and the recommendation of the consultants' report on the organisation of the extended board, it follows that, strategically, the screen commission function should now be co-ordinated under the Irish Film Board itself.</P>
    <P>The distinction originally envisaged between indigenous and incoming productions is less clear in practice than in theory, particularly in the case of European co-productions, which often involve a substantial Irish financial and management input into the project. Accordingly, it has now been decided to re-position the screen commission function. It is envisaged that the chief executive of the commission will now report directly to the Irish Film Board and will work in close liaison and co-ordination with the Bord Scannán team. I have no doubt the board will give careful consideration to the question of how best to build on the brand identity, connections and goodwill which have been built up by the screen commission, so that these can be exploited to the full in achieving the board's overall strategic objectives.</P>
    <P>I greatly appreciate the professionalism, commitment and considerable time the members of the screen commission have given to their task. Their knowledge of the industry and their prestige has enabled the pilot period of the commission's operation to be an important learning experience, and a very fruitful one. There are many Irish people, people of Irish descent, and friends of Ireland who occupy positions of eminence and influence in this global industry, including members of the outgoing screen commission, who are keen to help us in achieving the goals we have set ourselves. I will explore with the Irish Film Board how we might avail of this pool of goodwill.</P>
    <P>To return to the specific topic of the Bill, it will lay the financial foundations for the next phase of the development of the film industry in Ireland. I have outlined the extended role of the board in building upon what has been already achieved. Given the increased expenditure by the board in recent years, the Bill is now urgent, to enable the board to draw down funds for films which will go into production in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Exchequer allocation to the board, which is voted annually in the Vote for my Department, the board is also authorised to use recoupments of its loans under its schemes &ndash; repayment is conditional on certain commercial targets being reached by the film &ndash; and I envisage that the reinvestment of such recoupments will continue to play an important part in enhancing the board's support for the industry. The board, of its nature, is not a commercial bank and one of its principal functions is precisely to provide finance on terms which could not be offered by the commercial banking sector. However, as the industry matures it might be expected that the present recoupment rate of 13% should improve, providing additional resources for reinvestment in the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> Two issues arose in the course of my review of the Irish Film Board which should make my position clear. First, the question was raised of a change in the name of the board. I am opposed to this as it would suggest a break in the continuity of our film policies. The current title of the board, in Irish and in English, makes it clear that it is the State agency in Ireland with ultimate responsibility for the implementation of Government policy on film. This is as it should be. Second, it has been suggested that the board should be entirely based in Dublin. Deputies will be aware of the importance given by the Government to decentralisation. I do not envisage the board's headquarters moving from Galway. I agree with the board's approach, however, in having an office in Dublin and it will be a matter for the board to decide how it should organise its work as between Galway and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputies' co-operation in expediting the enactment of this short but vital Bill. As I have indicated, a number of imminent film productions are awaiting its passage to receive support from the board, hence its urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which allows the Irish Film Board to increase its expenditure, and the amount of money it gives out in terms of grants, from £30 million to £80 million. The Bill will be welcome news for the film industry, which has shown growth potential in the past decade and which I am sure will continue to provide the necessary incentives, funding and focusing on areas of inherent weakness.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board was established to ensure production and availability of films of Irish origin for both the home and international audiences. The board provides loans and investments to independent Irish film makers to help them in the development and production of Irish films. It also plays a vital role in the marketing, sales and distribution of Irish films and promotes training in many areas of film making.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the board has played a vital role in developing the film industry but falls behind many of our European counterparts. It is a young industry in Ireland but a valuable one which has enormous potential. The Irish nation is renowned for its playwrights, literature, writers of major international importance and poets. We have shown on a worldwide scale that we possess the creativity and the necessary talent to participate in the artistic media.</P>
      <P>The film industry and film production is growing but we have yet to show our strength in the area. I am convinced, from talking to the many film makers I have met in recent months who are involved in the industry and those who are attempting to promote it, that there is enormous untapped potential here. I have no doubt, however, that we can move forward given the necessary support from policy makers and the State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The films produced by Irish producers provide a wonderful opportunity to display our talents and to increase audiences both here and abroad. The Irish Film Board attempts to increase the audiences for Irish films and raises public awareness of the cultural, social and economic benefits of the vibrant film-making activities in Ireland. Last week saw the running of another successful international film festival in Cork which promotes film-makers and film developers. It is interesting to note that in 1986 the festival did not show any film of Irish origin, yet this year ten films of Irish origin and 46 home produced films were shown. That is a measure of the way our industry is progressing.</P>
    <P>Since its inception, the Cork Film Festival has championed the role of the short film which it believed was a neglected form of art which needed to be sustained. The festival has established an award system which is seen as a means of encouraging young film makers to produce short films. The short film can be exciting and the Cork Film Festival recognises that. This is not just a matter for those who are finding their feet in the film industry. Some of the most imaginative and innovative work done in the industry was in the short film. The Minister referred to digitalisation and the short film will become very important in that regard. There is a lot of scope in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to increase the capital grant to the film board and it would be remiss of us not to discuss the industry and its future, particularly in light of the two reports that were produced recently. The Minister promised to implement the report produced by Mr. Ossie Kilkenny, and I am glad she referred to it here. I look forward to seeing the Government plans but it is important that the Minister has shown her commitment to fully implementing the recommendations in that report. I hope that will happen because the report was a strategic overview of the development of the film industry to the year 2010. We are now approaching the end of the year 2000 and it is important that the recommendations in the report be implemented as soon as possible because that would be of enormous value to the film industry, not just in terms of producing feature films but also in terms of television, documentaries, short and long films. There will be an increased demand for those type of films, certainly with the introduction of digitalisation.</P>
    <P>The short film is experiencing a renaissance, with funding opportunities and greater possibilities for execution and distribution. Our own television channels, RTE, TG4 and TV3, will have a huge amount of broadcasting time available to them when digitalisation is introduced and there will be a market for producers of small films in the industry. It will be an answer to their prayers that we now have a ready market with somebody actually looking to fill slots. Those in the industry need to take note of that and realise that while the industry was relatively laid back in the past, <Col N="56" /> rapid change is on the way and there will be enormous demand for the production of Irish films. I hope that the report commissioned by the Minister, and the Government strategy that is now being finalised, will underpin her commitment and facilitate the industry.</P>
    <P>The review group looked to the long-term strategic view of the film industry but stood back from short-term pressures to help with its deliberations. It concentrated on the core activities of the film and television industries &ndash; production, distribution of films, dramas and documentaries, animation, broadcasts, cinema, television, home video, pay per view television, multi-media &ndash; all of which will play a vital role in the audio-visual industry. Before coming to any conclusions, the report set out its goal which is that by the year 2010, we will have a vibrant film sector inter-linked with commercial productions that will have an artistic merit as well as audience appeal across a range of media.</P>
    <P>The report noted, and rightly so, our long tradition of story telling. It is one of the core strengths of the industry and will give the industry a strong competitive advantage on the international scene. The fact that we are an English speaking nation is very much in our favour as the industry is predominantly English speaking.</P>
    <P>The attractiveness of Ireland as a location for film production cannot be underestimated. The Screen Commission of Ireland promotes Ireland internationally as a film location base and facilitates companies when they are in Ireland. It has been in operation since 1998 and is financed through the Irish Film Board. The principal activity is the promotion of Ireland internationally and this will include promoting tax advantages and the financial incentives to facilitate production companies here. It also provides comprehensive information on all aspects of film making from tax incentives to locations, crews, equipment, facilities and investment in the film infrastructure. The Screen Commission also acts as a contact point for a number of regional film commissions and organisations.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Ardmore Studios, I was shown a short film which the Screen Commission uses to promote Ireland abroad. It is breathtaking when one considers the films we have produced and the vast number of films and scenes shot throughout Ireland. Films shot here include &ldquo;Into the West&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; and &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; all of which include wonderful shots of Ireland. In addition to assisting the film industry, such films do wonders for tourism and promoting this country abroad. Unfortunately, we cannot market Ireland as a location for films requiring a warm climate but it was encouraging to see the range of scenery and locations we have. We should never under estimate our strengths in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many of the films I mentioned were produced by foreign companies which located in Ireland. However, this gives valuable, hands-on experience to Irish people who wish to work in the <Col N="57" /> industry. People in the industry continue to make the point that one can have technical expertise, schools, programmes and courses but there is no substitute for hands-on experience, no matter how short the film involved. Such experience is invaluable in terms of developing the industry but groups involved feel they are not getting sufficient practical experience. I spoke to such a group last weekend at the Cork Film Festival which felt there were not enough projects in which they could become involved.</P>
    <P>The report refers again and again to the development of script writing. This is a major concern which should be examined. The warning signals are there and scripts are a critical element for success in the film and television industry. It is essential that scripts are of a high quality and we need to develop excellence in the industry. The report was critical of script and project development in the Irish film industry and noted that, in the US, 10% to 15% of budgets are spent on the development of films whereas the figure is only 3% in Ireland. The report recommended much more investment in script production and development. More resources are needed to bring scripts to a more advanced stage of development before production.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that the State funding bodies should increase the percentage of their overall spend devoted to project development. Only a small number of projects will get to the production stage but much valuable work and effort is involved in the project development process.</P>
    <P>Script writing is a core skill and the board, in its recommendations for strengthening and broadening the role of the Irish Film Board, recommended that it be responsible for script development. The Minister referred to this in her speech. It also recommended that the film board would make experts available to producers to advise them on high-quality script development, bearing in mind that the script must appeal to an audience. Films will not be successful if scripts do not appeal to an audience or if the product is not marketable. It must be remembered that we are trying to develop a commercial and viable entity as well as developing excellence in the industry.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations in the report commissioned by the Minister deal with the role and responsibilities of the Irish Film Board <i>vis-à-vis</i> other State agencies. The Minister has recognised that the board's role will be strengthened. The recommendations were based on those made by the film board and the Minister noted the primary recommendation.</P>
    <P>Screen Training Ireland was established by the board and FÁS, in association with the Minister, as a direct result of a STATCOM report which examined the training needs of the independent film and television sector. The role of Screen Training Ireland is to implement a nationally agreed training strategy for the overall sector and it is endeavouring to strengthen the human resources infrastructure and development in the <Col N="58" /> sector. In addition to creative skills, an in-depth knowledge and a high level of specialised craft skills are necessary elements of film making. These specialised skills must be mastered and developed.</P>
    <P>Education and training are necessary initiatives in this area. The majority of those working in the industry have attended Irish-based training programmes, and the development of these people's skills is essential for the growth of the industry. The first education programmes were established in the late 1980s and there has been a steady expansion in the provision of programmes at diploma, primary and masters levels, and plans for further expansions are well advanced.</P>
    <P>Many education programmes are practically-based with an 80:20 ratio of practical to theoretical work. However, the review noted the strong industry perception of a serious imbalance between the content and career expectations created by such programmes and the reality of the work versus career structures in the industry. There is a perception that many education programmes are highly theoretical and lack the practical modules whereby the relevant skills are developed. History has shown the value of working with experienced practitioners and this hands-on experience is what is needed.</P>
    <P>Screen Training Ireland will ensure that training is carefully targeted at those already working in the industry, with an emphasis on short courses designed to assist, update and upgrade skills and knowledge, and a longer-term strategic development designed in co-operation with leading international professionals and agencies. On-going training and upgrading of skills is essential.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended an expansion of Screen Training Ireland's programmes and envisaged a fourfold expansion of the industry designed and conducted in close and regular consultation with the industry. The group also recognised that the training requirements attached to section 481 certification should be monitored by Screen Training Ireland. Those involved in the industry feel that section 481 or some tax regime should be considered to encourage people to stay in Ireland once they are trained. Many people cannot gain the relevant experience in Ireland so they go abroad. Having given so much time and investment, the Minister should examine ways, including tax measures if necessary, to encourage people to stay in Ireland. We must use everything in our power to develop this industry and ensure it is successful.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister considering increasing the number of board members and staff of the Irish Film Board? The board has a small number of members and staff and I would like to see this complement increased given the board's expanded role. We need to examine the funding of the film board. An increased amount of money also needs to be invested in project development. The review group considered a levy on cinema tickets and the sale or rental of videos. This practice is very successful and valuable, and works <Col N="59" /> well in many countries. According to the figures available to us, total revenues from the sale of cinema tickets and video rentals in Ireland amounted to over £110 million in 1997. In three years I am sure that figure has increased considerably. Even a 1% levy would generate substantial funding which could be earmarked for the production and distribution of Irish films in Ireland. I wonder if that is part of the Government's strategy. Will the Minister consider that recommendation? There is merit in a scheme to try to churn some funding back into the industry in order that it can be self-financing to some extent.</P>
    <P>No doubt the establishment of the Irish Film Board and the section 481 tax incentives remain the key elements for the future success of the industry in Ireland. The review examined the section 481 incentives and strongly recommended that it should be continued for at least seven years to show the market that we as a nation are serious about this industry and that the Government is committed to supporting it. The present practice of providing a three-year incentive treats the industry on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I note that the Minister referred to it, but there is a need to create confidence in the industry and let people know that they can have a future and make plans. The film industry is time consuming and involves lead in time, and therefore there is a need for greater stability and confidence in that area.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that the level of tax relief at the marginal rate for personal investors should be set at 100% for projects with budgets below £4 million and the 80% relief for projects with budgets over £4 million should be reviewed upwards in light of changes in conditions such as the lowering of rates of personal taxation. The Minister has not referred to that but perhaps she could look at it because the review group felt it would be necessary to encourage further development of the industry. Having spoken to people involved, I know that the industry is going well at present but that is probably due to the fact that there is considerable investment here from the UK and it is cheaper to work here at present because of the strength of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound. The latter is good news for the industry but it will apply only in the short-term and it does not really provide a sound basis for future development in the industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a vibrant film industry. It certainly has huge potential. Cinema and the development of film is an artistic experience, but the film industry is like any other manufacturing industry. It exists to make a saleable product. The main difference between a film and any other manufacturing process is that one cannot churn out the same film time after time. Each film must be different. If one develops a popular brand of biscuit, washing machine or washing powder, for example, the product will be sold again and again and one is guaranteed a market but there is no guarantee that a film by a director, who has made <Col N="60" /> a popular film previously, will necessarily be successful because every film is unique.</P>
    <P>It is difficult and expensive to succeed in the industry. It can necessitate a great deal of investment and pose many challenges and opportunities. Since Ireland has an English speaking population, there is huge potential in the short film industry. That will become increasingly popular in the future. It will give valuable experience to young producers and young people working in the industry. I would like to see that area develop. I am encouraged to see that the Cork Film Festival has been very successful in developing and promoting the short film industry, both at home and internationally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and any measure which provides funding for the industry. I also welcome the Minister's speech in which she acknowledges the report of the review group. I await publication of the Government's strategy and look forward to discussing that at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo, an Bille um Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Leasú), 2000. Mar a dúirt an tAire, tá reachtú an mBille seo práineach agus tá mé lán sásta cabhrú leí leis an mBille seo a reachtú gan mhaoil. The Minister told us it is important that the Bill is passed into law quickly. I accept that point and she will receive the full co-operation of this side of the House to achieve that end.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill with a simple purpose but for all that it is important. However, I want to make some general observations regarding the industry. Recently I had the pleasure of visiting a film company, Nemeton, in the Waterford Gaeltacht. The day I arrived the company had just employed its 20th person. A number of points struck me while I was on that visit. Here was an area in which it would have been difficult to date to bring in that number of well paid jobs in an important communications area. Because of information technology and the nature of the film industry, it is possible for these independent film makers to set themselves up anyway in Ireland in that, for example, premises need not be that big and, even though equipment is very expensive, there is no need for huge storage areas.</P>
      <P>In the context of not only keeping a population in rural Ireland but of keeping it in well paid employment in an exciting area, where the frontiers are extending and the possibilities are great, I was struck by the importance of the ongoing development of the film industry. However, one infrastructural factor was brought to my attention &ndash; the lack of a fibre optic connection to Nemeton. As a result products must be brought physically either to Cork or Waterford whereas if there was a fibre optic connection, that work could be done over the wire, thereby freeing up the man hours involved in people travelling to and from a location. In general it was a most interesting experience which gave me a new perspective on developing employment in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I want to address here relates <Col N="61" /> to the reposition of the Screen Commission, to which the Minister referred, <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord Scannán na hÉireann. The chief executive of the Screen Commission has been anxious to put in place film commissions in the various county and local authority areas generally. He has been anxious to speak to the county managers' association in that regard. The Minister in her speech outlined her thoughts on two issues, name and location. I agree with her decision on the name. One only changes a name for very important reasons and I see no legitimate reason to change the name of Bord Scannán na hÉireann here.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that, in line with Government policy, she will not decentralise the board from Galway and that a Dublin office will be developed. In the wider context of decentralisation and of making the industry available throughout the country, I am very taken with this concept of screen commissions in the various counties. There is, however, an additional complication in the five major cities in that we have county boroughs and county councils within the same county. Having considered it, my view is that there should be a screen or a film commission in the counties and in the cities and that there should be a high level of co-operation between them. It is also very important that where there are third level institutions or second level institutions, the film commission will interface with these.  </P>
    <P>The screen training programme has been successful but there are wider aspects to the whole film project which would benefit from more interface with Bord Scannán na hÉireann and from a more structured and strategic approach. As the Minister rightly pointed out, we have reached a stage in the development of the industry where a more strategic approach is needed. Obviously, a strategic approach can lead to much more detailed planning. I suggest, as the Minister said in her speech, that much of that planning is in the training area but we need to broaden it beyond the training area as such. The institutions should address the creativity required in this industry and put the various provisions in place to foster and develop that creativity and to give people the wherewithal and the chance to develop personally so they can make an input at that level.</P>
    <P>The concept, as I understand it, of county screen commissions would be that we would, in effect, have a one stop shop. In other words, there would be a data base of video and photographic material and inventory of the various skills available in the area and what is happening in regard to education. There is a pattern among many people who graduate from third level colleges to stay close to the college from which they graduate. Effectively, we are probably talking about one person who will have all the knowledge available when some of the mobile projects become available at short enough notice. The ability to respond comprehensively and effectively and to put the programme required in place is a laudable <Col N="62" /> and important ingredient. That needs to be available in all counties and cities. To refer to my earlier point, we need to have availability of jobs in all areas given that the base does not have to be that large.</P>
    <P>Many possibilities are opening up in the whole IT area. For instance, Enterprise Ireland is now seeking to move ahead in the context of e-commerce and IT generally so that we become involved in it and that jobs are provided in the internationally traded services sector, for example. This is an exciting time not least, as the Minister says, because of the possibilities arising in the context of digitalisation and the changes that are coming.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we will be coming back to the Broadcasting Bill on 15 November. A horror I have about more programmes and channels becoming available is that I have seen the range of channels available in Canada and the US and was not overly impressed by the content. All going well with digital terrestrial television here, there will be something of the order of 26 additional channels available. My horror scenario is that we would have a high level of repeats and rubbish. That is something about which we have to be very vigilant and concerned. We have a vibrant sector. That sector needs to grow and expand and to start to provide programmes to fill the additional slots that will become available.</P>
    <P>I will make one reference to the Broadcasting Bill and the £16 million being provided for independent film makers. I know that independent film makers would prefer that a percentage of the overall programme budget of the national broadcaster would be provided. It is extraordinarily important that the pool of money available, as in this context, for a commissioned work is as large as possible and should range over as comprehensive an area as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was different to that which she made in the Seanad and I noticed she referred to Irish language programming. I have been very impressed with some of the documentaries that have emanated from TG4. I know of one which was broadcast for the first time last Christmas and sometime during the summer by RTE called &ldquo;Talamh an Éisc&rdquo;. It was about Newfoundland in which, as a Waterford person, I would have an enormous interest. It was a very good quality documentary but it was, effectively, made on a shoestring. There is an enormous capacity in this country and in the film community generally to produce excellent and well thought out documentaries. There are many historical projects, happenings and so on and given the treatment of which our film community is capable, very attractive documentaries could emerge which would be highly saleable throughout the world. That would generate more revenue and bring more money into the whole area of film making.</P>
    <P>I said I would only make one comment on the Broadcasting Bill but the Minister will have it within his or her power to reserve a multiplex, <Col N="63" /> which is, effectively five channels for indigenous programmes that emanate from Northern Ireland. The number of programmes which emanate from that part of the country is not remarkable. The concept of co-operation and co-production is mentioned here. Given where we are heading with the peace process, something to which we should seriously address ourselves is going out and actively promoting the concept of co-operative programmes, or programmes produced through co-operation on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to realise that of the soap operas &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; has the highest number of viewers. Given that market will not disappear, it is one, as the Minister stated, to which we can apply ourselves. A strategic approach is required to attract companies large enough to be able to run a number of projects at the one time. The bottom line is that they must ensure they retain their key people. It is not a case that such people have work today but may not have it tomorrow. Deputy Clune mentioned that such people may go overseas to gain experience or because they cannot get work here. The approach adopted under the Bill and the funding being put in place represents a good strategy which I am confident will bring continuing beneficial results.</P>
    <P>The term used in industry regarding engineering is &ldquo;technology transfer&rdquo;. An important component of any area of development is that we have student exchanges, that students at all levels within the industry are exposed to the cutting edge, wherever that may be. People who go to non-English speaking countries to gain experience in the industry may encounter language difficulties. We must play our part in the international film community from the earliest possible stage by encouraging new entrants to participate in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;content is king&rdquo;, which reminds me of my time in the Department of Agriculture. When jobs were scarce in the 1980s and early 1990s we became focused on consumers. In terms of our media, the fundamental focus must be on our citizens as distinct from our consumers, as that is the quality assurance route.  The Minister also referred to niche products. A niche programme could be produced here that would have wide international appeal. We need to maintain a high quality content in our public service broadcasting. We must provide news coverage, although that is not essentially what we are dealing with. Moving away from strictly news and information programmes produced on a daily basis, the content of programmes on important subjects should be dealt with in a challenging way that will enhance the ability of people to analyse and to arrive at balanced decisions that will help them to deal with new issues by giving them a broad perspective on them. That is not always the most commercial road to take, but it is an extremely important one. The board has an <Col N="64" /> important role to play in ensuring the maintenance of the high quality content of such programmes. If at times that means a greater amount of money must be given to certain projects, that should be provided.</P>
    <P>Film making should be decentralised to various parts of the country. While various projects end up in certain areas, other areas should be proactive in attracting such projects and all that is required to carry out the production of such projects should be available. That would ensure a sharing out of the goodies on a wider basis. Counties Wicklow, Wexford and Kerry have film commissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Such promotion could not be in better hands. It is important that film making is decentralised throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Regarding financing, money will be available under the Broadcasting Bill when enacted, but we should examine other ways by which we can provide extra resources and incentives to attract people to invest in industry here. I am concerned about the level of ethics underpinning some programmes. Programmes containing sexually explicit material is one area, but there is also an over-emphasis of violence in many programmes and there are also video games. I am not sure if that area comes under the remit of Bord Scannán na hÉireann whereby it can address this problem.</P>
      <P>Certain practices, such as smoking, can be promoted in productions and made attractive to young people. The Minister for Finance, who has just joined us, took strong measures in that regard last year. I had responsibility for policy on that area for a period during my time in the Department of Health. A strategic approach should be adopted to ensure a code of ethics applies to practices such as smoking, consumption of alcohol and violence in the films we make to ensure the right message is sent to our young people and to young people in other countries to which our productions are exported.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and will co-operate to ensure its speedy passage through the House. I wish the Minister and Bord Scannán na hÉireann,</P>
      <P>the Screen Commission of Ireland and all the other components of the industry continuing success in this important area.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the amount by which he expects the consumer price index to rise, between now and the end of 2000; if he will introduce any measures prior to the budget to combat inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures show that headline inflation in September as measured by the consumer price index remained at 6.2% for the third month in a row. These figures show that the Government measures announced last June are working. Those measures were focused on improving competition and price awareness in sectors of the economy where competition was felt to be limited.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously, inflation may exceed the September level in the near term due to the impact of recent increases in oil prices and interest rates. Whether such a rise takes place, and its extent, will depend on a number of factors which cannot be predicted in advance, such as future changes in oil prices and in the value of the euro. However, the upward pressure on the headline consumer price index inflation rate will ease somewhat in December as last year's increase in excise duties on tobacco products falls out of the year-on-year comparison. My Department will publish forecasts for inflation in the stability programme which I will present to the Dáil on budget day. These forecasts will cover the period 2001 to 2003.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned, the Government has already introduced a range of measures to combat inflation. The impact of these measures is being closely monitored and the question of further measures is being considered in the context of the budget. The next budget will contain a balanced set of measures which will take account of prevailing economic conditions and which will be positive in terms of continued economic development and social progress. I will, of course, have regard to the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the context of the strategy for the budget. I have no plans to introduce further measures prior to budget day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was heartening to note that the CPI for the last three months remained at 6.2%, but considering that the largest lending institution in the country increased mortgage rates after the figures were published last month it will put upward pressure on the headline inflation rate due to the weighting of mortgage rates in the overall index. That will be an upward push. On the downward side there may be further competition in other areas leading to a downward movement and I would not be prepared to say at this stage what that is likely to be. I have signalled that mortgage interest rates will have a negative effect on the CPI.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Either in public or private I have never said what I expect the inflation rate to be, not even in the confines of my Department. Even the experts in this area, if not astounded by the outcome, were predicting an upward push but that did not happen. One would therefore be foolish to predict what it is likely to be. I have said that mortgage interest rates are likely to have a negative impact. I have not given that figure or any other to anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is not going to announce the budget now, but in the range of measures he is contemplating, are reductions in VAT and excise on fossil fuels being considered? Is there any external factor such as an EU directive or agreement that would put a floor under any proposal he might make to reduce the standard rate of VAT or excise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on a number of occasions, both here and to lobbyists, that I have been considering a range of measures including some of the options which the Deputy mentioned. It is only fair to point out that there is a limit to some of those measures and I also pointed this out to some of the lobby groups. Over the past ten years we have come from more or less the top quartile of the matrix regarding excise duties to the middle to bottom range of that matrix. Successive Governments have been very reluctant to make any excise duty increases and the last one was made by my predecessor in 1997. Any changes I have made, small as they may have been, have been to reduce excise duties.</P>
      <P>There are EU minima under which we cannot go, which was pointed out by some columnist in the recent debate on the road hauliers' dispute. Furthermore, it is fair to point out that over the past few years, including the period before I became Minister, there has been pressure in the EU for an energy tax directive. The effect of that would be to push up rather than down. Due to objections from a number of countries, mainly Ireland and Spain, no further progress has been made on that so the energy tax directive is currently in abeyance and the floor or minima are set by the EU minima rates of excise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that there are minima below which we cannot go in terms of excise duty. That restriction does not apply to VAT as it is up to each member state to make its own decisions in that regard. There is a floor but it is a long way from 21%. Other considerations must also be taken into account in this area and the Deputy mentioned some of them in the recent past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <Quest>the steps that are being taken to address the serious staffing crisis in the Civil Service arising from the current 1,794 vacancies; his views on whether current wage levels are sufficient to attract candidates; if he will give the number of civil servants in his own Department and the Civil Service generally who are in receipt of family income supplement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there is a staffing crisis in the Civil Service, though problems and pressures are certainly present, along with the broader challenge of recruiting and retaining high quality personnel in a competitive labour market.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's reference to 1,794 vacancies in the 15 Departments &ndash; deriving from replies to recent parliamentary questions &ndash; needs to be put in context. These Departments have a workforce of 22,000 persons, and will always have vacant posts, reflecting gaps between the occurrence of vacancies and the filling of those vacancies. In addition, many outstanding vacancies are new posts and competitions to fill these posts inevitably take time to run.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission is responding to market challenges, and has eliminated past shortfalls in the supply of clerical officers to Departments. The bulk of departmental demands for clerical officers, currently amounting to 127 for the 15 Departments, will be satisfied in the very short term. The Commission has responded to other departmental demands by accelerating the throughput of candidates from existing competitions and by holding new competitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The starting pay of the two main general service recruitment grades has recently been revised to £12,667 for clerical officers and, depending on age, between £15,536 and £17,880 for executive officers. I consider these figures reasonable, but my Department will monitor their effect on recruitment and retention. The Civil Service has much to offer in the area of non-pay conditions. Family-friendly initiatives such as job-sharing and career breaks are already in place and, subject to talks with the unions, a major work-sharing initiative is expected to be launched next year. <Col N="68" /> Statistics on the numbers of civil servants receiving family income supplement are not available.</P>

      <P>Depending on economic conditions, at various stages during the past 25 to 30 years we were overwhelmed by the numbers of people trying to join the Civil Service. On other occasions, the service experienced difficulties in trying to recruit staff. I am sure this position will obtain in the future. In light of general economic conditions, I recognise that there is difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff within the Civil Service. However, that problem is not confined to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, changes to any of the Civil Service grades will have a knock-on effect throughout the wider public service. He must take into account the fact that there are advantages to joining the Civil Service that no private employer can offer. Due to buoyant economic conditions, it is not as attractive, perhaps, as it once was for certain people to join the Civil Service. However, the service has many attractions which private employers cannot offer, the most important of which is security of tenure.</P>

      <P>It was, unfortunately, not possible for the Government to take decisions in relation to a new programme of decentralisation by the end of the summer, as had originally been intended, because of the scale of the proposed programme including, for example, issues relating to the identification of those who would relocate as well as the centres to which they would relocate. It is, however, the Government's intention to proceed with the new programme. It is my intention that the Government will be in a position to take the necessary decisions by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In an effort to inform the Government's decision the views of the Civil Service management and the civil and public service unions have been invited and I am confident that these groups will bring to bear their considerable experience and contribute significantly to informing the decision-making process. The Government has established a Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation, which, apart from myself, includes the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This sub-committee will take a number of factors into account as part of its deliberations, including the views of those groups whose views have been invited as well as the many submission and representations which have been received from or made on behalf of some 120 urban centres throughout every county.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall briefing the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service on this matter before the summer recess and giving categorical assurances that the programme would have been announced by now. In that context, I do not believe the Minister has answered the question on the Order Paper in full. However, if decentralisation proceeds will it be done on the basis of objective criteria or on that of political favouritism? The Minister will recall <Col N="71" /> that his colleague, the Minister for Defence, sent civil servants to his home town&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not possible to list the various criteria that will be taken into account. With regard to the decentralisation of staff of to Cahirciveen and Roscrea to which the Deputy referred, the numbers involved were quite small. The decision to decentralise these staff was not made in the context of the overall decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will adopt the same criteria applied by the previous Government when the Environmental Protection Agency and a large section of the Department of Agriculture and Food were moved to Wexford, the constituency of the then Ministers for the Environment and Agriculture and Food, Deputies Howlin and Yates.</P>

      <P>Some reporters in the Dublin media do not appear to take account of the fact that decentralisation of a section of a major Government Department to certain areas throughout the country would be better for them than the arrival of a major industry.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established a steering group to carry out a review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners consequent on the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters Parliamentary Inquiry into the DIRT First Report. The report of the review, which was noted by Government, was submitted to the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee on 1 September and was published by it on 5 September. The sub-committee also sought submissions on the report through public advertisements in the national newspapers which were placed by my Department at its request. The sub-committee will examine the report on 30 November 2000.</P>

Given the work already carried out by the steering committee and the investigations that have been going on within his Department, is the Minister satisfied there is not the possibility of a second DIRT scandal? Is he satisfied that Revenue has implemented and enforced Revenue law to the degree we all expect and require and that there is not another scandal lurking in the closet?</P>

We all need to be satisfied, therefore, that there is not another potential scandal about which we know nothing at this stage. I do not have specific information.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reply to some of the proposals made by the steering group? For example, recent newspaper reports suggested that he intends to abolish the Revenue Commissioners as such and bring in outside people. Perhaps he will give his initial reaction to that suggestion. Does he believe there should be increased use of information technology, for example, to randomly select people for audit? Does he believe the Revenue should publish more data on the number of audits carried out and the amount of tax collected under particular headings and so on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put on the record my appreciation of the changes the Revenue Commissioners have made in the past ten or 15 years. I refer to this aspect during Committee Stage of the Finance Bill each year. As one who has practised in that area, I find the changes which have taken place in the past ten to 15 years in relation to Revenue practice and efficiency is mind-boggling. It should not be forgotten that significant changes have taken place. I have said previously outside this House that when the history of the Celtic tiger is written, there will certainly be a chapter on the changing efficiencies within the Revenue Commissioners, which have contributed greatly to the large Exchequer surpluses in recent years.</P>
      <P>I compliment the steering group set up as a result of the public accounts committee inquiry. This involved some people from outside the country and the report was published within a remarkably short period. I compliment also the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the wonderful work they did. As a result of the publication of the report, advertisements have been placed in the newspapers requesting people to make further submissions. The sub-committee group will go before the Committee of Public Accounts early next month. The public accounts committee will then make recommendations and I do not have a closed mind as to what should or should not be done about the various structures within the Revenue Commissioners. It will be important to hear the views of the Committee of Public Accounts. It will be important also to hear the submissions as a result of the publication of the report. When this process is concluded, I will consider the matter and bring recommendations to Government. The Government will then consider the matter further and all these issues will be taken into account. The public accounts committee has done a particularly good job. The steering group which compiled the report has done an excellent job in opening up some very interesting questions and putting forward many recommendations, all of which I will consider.</P>

Everyone has been impressed at the speed with which these issues have been considered in recent months, therefore it is not my intention to delay the matter, because this uncertainty would not be good for the morale of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners. We should make speedy decisions and put them into effect, which is what I intend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget for the year 2000 a specific provision of IR£2.5 million was made for special works which would alleviate flooding in the south Galway area. On 10 January 2000, I appointed a steering group to bring forward proposals for the expenditure of up to IR£2.5 million for special works to alleviate the effects of flooding in the south Galway area and to report back to me.</P>
      <P>This money remains available but certain issues need to be addressed before the works can be executed. These issues are in hand which I will summarise for the Deputy. The first meeting of the group was held on 13 January and it has met on six occasions. I am in receipt of reports from these meetings. Initially there were five schemes proposed for attention. The up-to-date position on each scheme is as follows. In relation to Ballyglass-Cregclare-Ardrahan, detailed drawings have been prepared and an environmental statement is being completed by the consultant engineers. A survey of all reputed proprietors, owners and rated or other occupiers of the several lands proposed to be interfered with is currently under way by staff from the Office of Public Works with a view to putting forward a scheme for public exhibition by the end of this year. In the meantime, Galway County Council has been contacted to carry out essential maintenance on a section of the tributary which forms part of the Dunkellin drainage district. This should be of some help in the short term.</P>
      <P>In Mannin Cross the consultant engineers are currently completing revised drawings to show reduced control water levels, which will then be passed to Dúchas for its observations. The downstream consequences of any scheme must also be evaluated and this will be done by monitoring the rate of rise of water levels over a winter period. This assessment is being undertaken at present.</P>
      <P>In Termon the consultant engineers are engaged in ongoing hydrological analysis of this proposed scheme. The effect on the River Fergus must also be determined. This requires a full winter's cycle of data on flows from Termon to be assessed. This is being carried out over this winter. Monitoring of these flows is ongoing and the findings should be available by the end of April, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Kilchreest, the downstream effects of any proposed works will require a full winter's monitoring and this is being carried out <Col N="76" /> over this winter. In relation to Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen, Office of Public Works staff have completed a survey of the area and this is currently being examined in conjunction with the original design completed by consulting engineers and also taking account the various environmental restrictions imposed by Dúchas. It is expected a report will be prepared early in 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned schemes, the steering group invited submissions from interested bodies and individuals regarding other works which might be considered for attention. As a consequence, staff from the Office of Public Works undertook a survey of the Roo Demesne area. It is felt by the steering committee that the problems in this area might be dealt with locally.</P>
    <P>Two culverts were identified for replacement in the Kinvara area to restore the drainage to what it was prior to raising the roads. Galway County Council has been requested to undertake these works.</P>
    <P>Two further applications are being processed under the 1995 home relocation scheme. The total expenditure to date is approximately IR£42,000 made up of fees and expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Again there is talk of reports, studies and assessment. Does the Minister of State realise that the Peach report cost £1 million and no flood alleviation has been carried out to date? Of the £2.5 million provided in last year's budget, will the Minister of State indicate whether that will remain in place until work begins or will some of the money finance the other works he has outlined? Does he realise that people living in this flood threatened area are in terror of repeated flooding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still one family living in the area affected by the flooding, who have not availed of relocation. I compliment the steering committee on the work it has carried out. However, can this family avail of relocation through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which must get the blessing of the steering committee and the Minister of State's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy acknowledged that the steering committee was set up and has done excellent work. He is aware that neither I nor anyone else can go into an area until all the proper procedures are completed such as environmental impact statements, economic assessments and the effects downstream. These are tedious and slow to deliver in terms of results. The Deputy knows I cannot carry out an assessment based on what happens in the winter. I must know what happens in the summer, autumn and spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy knows I cannot do an assessment based on what happens in the winter alone. If I <Col N="77" /> measure water levels in the summer when it is dry and base a scheme on that I will be laughed at. The Deputy knows we must do this. We have moved as quickly as possible to bring in a scheme. Nothing has dominated more in the Department than this area of south Galway. The report to which the Deputy referred is a valuable resource for Galway County Council in terms of its future planning. It demonstrated that, at the end of the day, very little could be done given the topography and configuration of the area. When the Minister for Finance made the extra £2.5 million available I decided to deliver schemes in some specific peripheral areas but my officials and I are constrained by the laws and legalities relating to the carrying out of this scheme, not to mention environmental impact statements and so on that must be completed in the public interest so that everyone is satisfied and in agreement with what we must do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall scheme to which the Deputy refers will be a resource for Galway for the next 100 years. No other area will have that. The report is a valuable one and represents money well spent. The specific small peripheral schemes were not covered in that report. The steering committee was set up and money was provided. Out of £2.5 million, £42,000 was spent. The money is intact to deliver the schemes and no-one wants to deliver them more than I and other Deputies from Galway, including the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who has been involved in this also as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <P>There are a number of factors which have contributed to the impressive performance of the Irish economy over the 1990s. These include a young and educated workforce, reflecting investment in education over three decades; membership of the EU and full participation in EMU, which gives us access to a market of over 300 million people; social partnership, which has sustained competitiveness while delivering real increases in pay; improved incentives facilitated by reductions in both personal and corporate taxation; a positive business environment that has encouraged investment generally and foreign direct investment, particularly in high technology industries such as electronics and pharmaceuticals; prudent budgetary policies that have dramatically lowered the national debt and the burden of debt service on present and future taxpayers. These factors, together with appropriate Government policies, raised employment by over 500,000, cut unemployment by 140,000 and brought Irish living standards up to the EU average.</P>
      <P>To sustain this performance we must ensure that Ireland continues to be an economy which can successfully compete in the global marketplace. To attain this goal we must continue to successfully meet the challenge of inflation and maintain Irish competitiveness through implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; continue with a prudent approach to the public finances in line with the stability and growth pact; encourage structural change through increased competition; and ensure implementation of the National Development Plan in order to provide the infrastructure to sustain progress.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that the economic success we have all worked so hard to achieve will continue and it will take appropriate measures as the situation demands.</P>

      <P>I did not want to allow such a finely crafted question by my constituency colleague, Deputy Callely, to go without comment and, indeed, a wonderfully worded response given by the Minister. Does the Minister agree that the PPF has become a floor in terms of private sector earnings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is conflicting evidence in that area. Anecdotally people say some firms are using it as the floor and are giving wage increases outside of it. I hear through official channels and from IBEC that is not the case. It is a voluntary agreement and it is up to employers to decide how to conduct their own internal industrial relations and pay terms. The evidence so far is contradictory. One hears of settlements that are well outside of it but one is told the majority of firms in the private sector are abiding by its terms. It will be some time before we have the correct story.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, including in the Adjournment debate on this issue last week, the inter-departmental review group, under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was set up to review the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Scheme. The principal issue of concern expressed by the public in connection with the relief under the scheme was, and still is, in relation to the medical criteria. Arguably, the continual pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its valuable relief, giving access to tax free cars and motor fuel, in effect, for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that over 250 written submissions were received by the review group. Oral submissions were heard over a three day period in early May 2000 and over a 2½ day period in September. I have been informed that a doctor from the Eastern Region Health Authority, an official from the Association of Health Boards and a senior medical officer from the Mid-Western <Col N="80" /> Health Board made oral submissions to the group. The Medical Board of Appeal also made an oral submission. The contributions made by those officials in particular, who are familiar with the operation of the scheme on a day-to-day basis, will be valuable to the review group in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>All the written and oral submissions are now being examined by the group and I hope that they will help in the finalisation of the report. The review group has given no indication yet of when its work will be completed.</P>

The group is not chaired by my Department but by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope to receive a reply in the near future. They have received a number of written and oral submissions and the matter is quite complicated. As the Deputy rightly points out, there was a study made of parliamentary questions that I replied to since coming to the Department of Finance and, apart from decentralisation, this matter was the second highest in terms of parliamentary questions. The highest number of replies in this area were probably to the Deputy. There is considerable interest in the matter and I await the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of ACC Bank undertook a fundamental review of the bank, which was submitted to me in May this year. The bank is improving its competitive position by implementing a programme of restructuring and rationalisation with the ultimate objective of ensuring a change in ownership for the bank.</P>
      <P>In connection with the restructuring of the bank, I have sanctioned the negotiation of an employee share ownership plan and I understand that negotiations have commenced between the management and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank itself plans to move away from unprofitable lines in general retail banking which demand scale and to concentrate on business banking, which has proven more attractive for the bank. ACC also plans to change the way it does business by moving away from being primarily a manufacturer of financial products to being an adviser-consultant on and a distributor of finan<Col N="81" /> cial products. A key element in the plan is to deliver a significant reduction in the cost:income ratio. Successful implementation of this business strategy should improve the bank's financial prospects.</P>
    <P>In 1999, ACC's underlying profits before tax and exceptional items were about £19.3 million. The bank's recent DIRT settlement of £17.9 million is expected to lead to a small net loss for the current year, but the underlying position is still profitable. On the basis of the interim results on 30 June 2000, shareholders' funds stood at IR£128.8 million. Allowing for growth in business, the capital adequacy ratio is expected to be comfortably in excess of the Central Bank's regulatory requirements.</P>
    <P>I have communicated to the board that ACC Bank has my full support in preparing to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive marketplace. I am satisfied that the underlying prospects for ACC, combined with the financial improvements from restructuring, will allow it to continue to trade profitably and to prepare for a successful change in ownership. I expect to receive a business plan from the company setting out its strategy to achieve this objective early next year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I will be bringing legislation before the House which will involve an increase in the amount of share capital I can subscribe. It will also provide for an ESOP and enabling provisions in relation to the sale of the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister sought assurances from ACC Bank regarding the possibility of a requirement of additional State funding in the light of current liabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the first report of the parliamentary inquiry into DIRT, I have changed the ACC reporting procedure. I now meet the chairman of ACC on a quarterly basis and officials of my Department meet the chief executive and others, at least on a quarterly basis. I have had communications with the ACC on many occasions regarding various matters which are in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim results of June 2000 show shareholders' funds of £128.8 million. Allowing for growth, the capital adequacy ratio is expected to be comfortably in excess of the Central Bank's regulatory requirements. I will bring a short Bill <Col N="82" /> before the House in the near future as well as a Bill dealing with the ICC. These will allow the Minister to subscribe more share capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question what the Minister said. However, has he sought assurances from the chairman regarding whether ACC would require additional State funding? Has he raised such questions with ACC Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very exact science. The figures are clear from the balance sheet. If additional State funding is required the figures show that clearly and the House usually allows legislation to allow the Minister to subscribe more share capital. That is not a problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that in the past two years ACC Bank has been involved in high profile cases, particularly in relation to the DIRT inquiry. I have had a number of communications with the chairman of ACC and I meet him regularly. The bank is preparing a new business plan. The difficulties regarding DIRT occurred when the present chairman was not a member of the board. I thank the chairman, Mr. Pádraig O'Connor for the time and effort he has devoted to ACC. It is far above what he envisaged when he accepted the position.  </P>
      <P>The matters referred to by the Deputy are not a problem. If they become a problem I can correct it quite easily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank recently stated its intention to withdraw from a large number of corporate deals following a recent controversial loan. Does this not raise serious concerns with the Minister? Has he raised concerns regarding liability with ACC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The job of any bank is to conduct its affairs in a prudent manner. Not all deals can be totally profitable. It is also in the nature of the banking business to suffer losses. I am satisfied that the changes brought about in ACC will address any past shortfalls in reporting arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 9, 24, 25 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the Government will be in a position to take decisions in relation to a new programme of decentralisation by the end of this year. As soon as the decisions have been taken the logistical arrangements, such as staff training and the provision of suitable accommodation, will be addressed. In view of the many considerations which need to be taken into account in the implementation of the programme, not least those of the staff involved and the need to ensure that the effective and efficient delivery of public services is maintained, it is difficult to indicate with any certainty the time it will take to complete the programme.</P>
      <P>In taking its decision the Government is anxious to take into account the views of various interests, including those of the communities to which staff will be relocating, the Departments/offices/agencies involved and, of course, the staff who will be transferring. The Government has recently asked the Secretaries General, as a group, to indicate their views and has also asked the civil and public service staff unions to advise it on the criteria they believe should be applied in making decisions on the areas to be decentralised and the criteria which should apply to the selection of locations. This recent initiative is the latest in a series of consultations which have taken place with the civil and public service staff unions. Through the general council, the unions have been kept abreast of developments since very early this year. In addition each of the unions concerned was met individually by officials of my Department and I personally met them jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that Civil Service management and staff have an important role to play in the decentralisation process, the issues raised by decentralisation involve other groups and interests whose advice and aspirations will also need to be evaluated. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Decentralisation which, apart from myself, includes the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment and Local Govern<Col N="84" /> ment will, therefore, take into account management and unions' views which have been invited and these views, with the submissions and representations received from or on behalf of some 120 urban centres throughout the country, will contribute to informing the Government's ultimate decision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the submissions received I have been careful to date, and I do not want to depart from that position, not to prejudice the decisions which have to be taken by the Government in embarking on this ambitious programme. At this stage I do not think it would be helpful for me to say any more than that I am aware of the many cases made for inclusion in the forthcoming programme and to assure Deputies that they will be taken fully into account by the Government in their consideration of the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a problem here. There is a real difficulty in the Minister saying he has received representations from urban district councils and from Members of the House, that he does not intend to say how he will make decisions on decentralisation and that he will not tell us the criteria for making those decisions. The least we can expect is that the criteria by which decisions will be determined should be made public. The Minister is not being asked to set up high level interdepartmental groups. He is simply being asked to tell people what will decide the issues. That is hardly unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>By the time the current programme of decentralisation is completed by the end of next year, part of which commenced when Deputy Noonan was in government, 14,000 civil and public servants out of a total of 31,700 civil servants and 2,500 public servants will have been relocated outside Dublin. It is my ambition to add a further 10,000 civil and public servants to that list, whereby at the end of the process 75% of civil and public servants will have been relocated outside Dublin. Various criteria will be taken into account, including suggestions made by management, the civil and public service unions and the centres to which civil and public servants may be relocated. All these matters were taken into account by previous Administrations in making final decisions. The figure of 10,000 represents the largest number of civil and public servants to be relocated in one go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not reasonable to ask that the Minister should state the obvious, that a town <Col N="85" /> should have sufficient social and transport infrastructure to sustain the body to be relocated or is the Minister afraid that when push comes to shove towns such as Cahirciveen will not measure up and he will end up breaching the criteria?

It is one of the reasons the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is a member of the Cabinet sub-committee. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will have an input in such matters, as will the Office of Public Works, for which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has responsibility.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the programme of decentralisation to towns such as Letterkenny has worked extremely well and that, contrary to newspaper reports that civil servants supposedly do not want to move, there are many towns to which they would be quite happy to be relocated? There is a significant demand for places in towns such as Buncrana, but an insufficient number of Civil Service jobs available. The decentralisation programme, therefore, has many pluses.</P>

      <P>When the decentralisation programme was introduced all the difficulties mentioned were highlighted. The success of the programme in towns such as the one to which my colleague referred as well as Sligo and Letterkenny has encouraged civil servants in Dublin to relocate to other parts of the country. Even trade union leaders are surprised at the level of interest shown in the programme. Despite the official line, many civil servants wish to relocate for reasons of lifestyle and education, among others. They are aware of the advantages. Everybody has benefited, including the towns con<Col N="86" /> cerned. I was informed recently by a trade union leader in the nursing profession that they are inundated with requests to relocate to other parts of the country, that nurses will not take up jobs in the Dublin region. The advantages and mistakes learned will be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, vacancies in the Dublin region cannot be filled while there is a huge demand for staff in other parts of the country. Does he agree, therefore, that it is vitally important that the decentralisation programme is up and running as quickly as possible to try to fill these vacancies? People want to leave Dublin within a week of their arrival because of the Government's failure to provide necessary infrastructure. While I take the Minister's point that he should not have to tick boxes, surely some criteria have been laid down. Is it the case that towns included previously in the programme will be included again or will new towns be added? Is it the case that to be included there must a Minister in a constituency? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter will not be a criterion, that there will have to be a Minister in a constituency. The Deputy referred to only one aspect of the criteria. Some of the more loftier commentators do not want the fact that a town has been included in the decentralisation programme previously to be taken as a consideration. They argue that there should be other more objective criteria. It will, however, be one of the criteria considered.</P>
      <P>One of the points well developed at the committee meeting which Deputies Noonan and McDowell attended was that there is an advantage in having a decentralised Department in a region in terms of recruitment, promotion and career path. Travelling 20 miles from one town to another is not a big imposition whereas travelling 20 miles in and around Dublin is. For the decentralisation programme to be successful as big a group as possible should be relocated in a region so that individual civil servants would see a clear career path and would not be faced with the prospect of being an executive officer for the rest of their careers. That would not be fair. They should be able to see that if they join a particular Department, there is another section of the same Department or other Departments within a radius of ten to 25 miles. Dublin is the not the only place in Ireland. If we were starting with a green field I am sure Parliament would not be located in Dublin either. We should think about what the situation would be if an entire Department was located in some of the towns mentioned, whereby instead of heading for Dublin on a Monday morning Ministers would head for town A. I intend to introduce some lateral thinking to the subject.</P>

      <P>Is it likely that any part of the Department of Finance will be decentralised? It has been suggested to me that under the Public <Col N="87" /> Service Management Act Secretaries-General who are responsible for the internal management of Departments would have a serious role in any decision which might be taken. What is the Minister's view of that opinion? I appreciate that he has established a committee which includes Secretaries-General, but how does he read the legal position? </P>

      <P>The Deputy answered part of his question. Secretaries-General, as a group, are being consulted as part of the recent initiative. Their views will be taken into account. We must also take account of the need to make Departments work efficiently and this is one of the matters under consideration.</P>
      <P>If this is to be successful we must bring a new mind-set to the deliberations. For example, Germany, with a population of approximately 80 million, moved its entire administration from one city to another.</P>

We talk of 60 and 100 miles being big distances to travel. That is nonsensical. I have looked at maps in other parts of the world where Ireland did not feature because it is so small. We make a big issue about a few miles. We must stop thinking like that. For example, we must stop persisting with the idea that because a Department, or part of a Department, has been in Dublin for the past 70 years it must remain in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In this decentralisation programme we will give consideration to all locations. All will have an equal chance.</P>

      <P>Especially when he goes into K Club mode and starts talking in terms of a drive and a four iron. Will the Minister elaborate on the notion that decentralisation might arise from decisions to cluster Departments or sections of them? Does he see a model where a Department could be located in, say, the Limerick area with sections of it placed in, say, Ennis, Shannon, Tipperary town, Nenagh or Newcastlewest? The Minister appears to favour that kind of development. Is that the case? Could he elaborate with examples from around the country?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to illustrate by way of example, but decentralisation in clusters is to the forefront of my mind. I have had individual meetings with Ministers and their Secretaries <Col N="88" /> General and have tried to get them to think in terms of what is being proposed here. The Deputy's analogy of his region could equally apply elsewhere. Within that region there could be sub-relocations. That would give a new impetus to people joining in terms of their career path and the services provided. I am pleased that, apart from me, at least one other Member has given thought to this aspect.</P>
      <P>This will be an important criterion in making decisions. I hesitate to elaborate in case some may take the view that some areas will be excluded. That will not happen. If the country is considered on this basis a far different picture will emerge on what should be done.</P>

It reminds me of an advertisement from the national lottery to the effect that if people continue to participate everybody will get the same chance.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Government is serious about this programme. It has thrown in the towel because it could not agree on what is to be done. The Minister will not admit it, but he is as well to say it now rather than in six or 12 months when it will become more than apparent.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comments on clustering. Will he elaborate? Perhaps the most appropriate and suitable cluster outside the immediate Dublin rim would be one involving Kildare town, Portarlington and Portlaoise. I understand submissions on those lines have been received in the Department. The only difficulty with such a cluster is that a Minister is not resident in any of those towns. All the experience with the Government, and all the indications, suggest that if a town does not have a resident Minister the area does not have a chance of being considered. Will the Minister deny this and will he indicate that towns other than those with resident Ministers will be considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 17 and 77 together. The most data on the Balance of Payments indicate that Ireland continues to run a current account surplus. This indicates that total savings in the economy are sufficient to fund current investment needs. Nevertheless, concern has been expressed about the evolution of the personal savings ratio in the country. This ratio reflects the difference between personal disposable income and personal expenditure as measured in the National Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest available estimates of the personal savings ratio published by Central Statistics Office relate to 1998. For that year it is estimated that the personal savings ratio was 9.6%. The Autumn 2000 Quarterly Economic Commentary published by the ESRI estimates that the personal savings ratio fell to 9% in 1999. For 2000 the ESRI forecast a decline to 6.7%. It should be <Col N="90" /> noted that there is considerable uncertainty about these estimates and forecasts and they are likely to be revised &ndash; perhaps significantly &ndash; over time.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that any decline in personal savings is offset by increased savings by the Government. It is now estimated that the General Government Surplus will be 3.9% in 2000. Sensible management of the public finances during this period of exceptional economic growth will remain a key priority for the Government.</P>
    <P>Rather than focusing on the issue of the savings ratio<i> per se,</i> it might be better to look at matters from the perspective of inflation, the real concern in the economy today. As Minister for Finance I am, of course, aware of the growing demand pressures in the economy. The Government is acutely concerned about the impact that excessive inflation could have on our economic performance. In response to this threat, we took measures in June of this year to address inflationary pressures. These measures focus on fostering competition and monitoring prices. Recent indications are that these measures are working.</P>
    <P>I am aware of proposals that have been made by various bodies to counter demand-led inflation and which relate to incentivised savings schemes, as well as to the granting of a pensions bond. I will be considering the various proposals from the perspective of their efficacy in reducing excess demand and in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a number of statistics but he will also be aware of the statistic in the most recent quarterly national accounts that consumer spending has risen by nearly 10%. If I understood the Minister correctly, he is saying it is that figure that is of concern, rather than the savings ratio. Among the measures the Minister is talking about, is he considering a reduction in the rate of DIRT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the reply, and perhaps I should say it more strongly now, there is considerable scepticism about the savings ratio in terms of these figures and it should be treated with extreme caution. There is a residue in the national accounts and even the experts are having difficulty in agreeing the figures. I will give the Deputy an example. The ESRI, which is very reputable, forecast in September a rate of 6.7% for this year and forecast a rate of 9% in its June publication. There is a difference between the two figures at the end of the account. I am not casting any doubt on how the figures are compiled but it is a difficult figure to calculate. What was the Deputy's particular question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the question because the Tánaiste is on record in the relatively recent past as saying that she wants to find means of encouraging people to save, and the Minister is basically saying that he is looking for means of encouraging people not to spend, if I understood <Col N="91" /> his answer correctly. What measures is he considering to do that and specifically is he considering the idea of reducing DIRT? Also, is he considering the idea of a savings bond as proposed by the ICTU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that as a general rule Irish people do not like to pay tax, particularly on savings? For many people the traditional way of saving was the biscuit tin under the bed but a slightly more sophisticated method is to take out bank drafts. Is the Minister concerned that there might be many uncashed bank drafts lying in financial institutions throughout the country? People who got bank drafts may have died or whatever and to the best of my knowledge there is no method whereby the legal profession can establish the contents of a will from a bank in those circumstances. Money gained through illegal means may have been used to acquire bank drafts. Has the Minister any plans to examine the concept of putting a limit on the life of a bank draft, which is the case in several other countries, because it is possible that there are bank drafts in some financial institutions that are 50 years old?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not given any consideration to that. I read some comments that the Deputy made recently on this matter. I will have the matter examined in my Department but as of now, I do not have any particular proposals. I take note of what the Deputy said, and what he said previously about this matter, but it is not something to which I have given much thought because I do not believe it is that much of a problem. People are more likely to forget about dormant bank accounts than about bank drafts. However, I do not have any empirical evidence to back up that suggestion.</P>

      <P>Environmental protection remains a key objective for the Government.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006. For the benefit of the House I recall the key features of the plan, which was launched by the Government last November. In my forward to the plan I said its vision was to ensure that Ireland will remain competitive in the global international marketplace and that the fruits of economic success will be shared more equally at regional level and throughout society. This vision was reflected in the following key objectives of the plan, namely, to continue sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidate and improve Ireland's international competitiveness; foster balanced regional development; and promote social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Consistent with this vision and objectives, the Government decided it should be an ambitious national plan which was wide in scope, rather than having the drawing down of EU funding as its primary focus. Accordingly, for the first time, the plan included key areas of social infrastructure, such as housing and health.</P>
      <P>The ambition of the plan is illustrated by the unprecedented level of funding provided &ndash; over £40 billion at 1999 prices. Of this £40 billion just under £36 billion is from domestic sources, the vast bulk of which is from the Exchequer. This level of Exchequer provision is not only a dividend of the excellent management of the economy in recent years, it is also a clear signal of the Government's determination to see the vision and objectives of the plan realised.</P>
      <P>Key features of the plan include an investment of about £21 billion in the economic and social infrastructure which, over the period of the plan, will transform the road network and bring about significant improvements in the level of public transport provision; an employment and human resources programme of almost £10 billion with a major focus on education and training for those who are disadvantaged or unemployed; a programme of about £4.5 billion for the productive sector, including an objective over the period of the plan that more than half of all new jobs from future new foreign direct investment projects will be in the Border, midlands and west region; a £15 billion allocation across all operational programmes aimed at promoting social inclusion; an allocation of £6.7 billion in various operational programmes to support rural development; and a minimum target of almost £2 billion for public-private partnership investment under the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> The plan also contains significant other features including, for the first time, the devolution of the management of the two regional operational programmes to the regional assemblies for the Border, midlands and western, and southern and eastern regions, respectively; a commitment in the context of regional development policy to the preparation of a national spatial strategy and a reinforced basis for North-South co-operation on foot of the development plans of both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>In summary, the NDP is without precedent in terms of its ambition, scope and level of resources. It is not surprising, therefore, that there was a consensus among social partners and regional interests at the time of its launch that it represented a solid blueprint for tackling the economic and social issues facing Ireland in the early years of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Solid progress has been made in implementing the plan since it was published in November last. The community support framework for Ireland, which sets out the agreed priorities for the use of Structural Funds under the NDP, has been agreed with the European Commission and was formally adopted in July. The CSF reflects the plan's priorities and strategies. Negotiations have effectively concluded with the Commission on the operational programmes.</P>
    <P>The employment and human resources development operational programme has been approved and the remaining five operational programmes are expected to be approved by the Commission very shortly. Work is progressing with the special EU programmes body and the Northern Ireland authorities on finalising the peace operational programme for submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards plan expenditure, while progress was relatively slow in the first six months of this year, the quarter to the end of September has seen an acceleration in key areas. In the infrastructure area, expenditure on roads has been noticeably strong. While expenditure in other infrastructural areas has been weaker to date it is still anticipated that overall spend in 2000 under this heading will be very close to the plan's target for the year.</P>
    <P>Obviously current escalating costs in the construction sector are a major worry in terms of their implications for the level of resources necessary to deliver the planned level of output under the NDP. It is no secret that the tender prices across the whole range of the NDP infrastructure programme have been higher then when the plan was prepared. There is a limit to which the Exchequer can be expected to compensate for excessive cost increases. Nonetheless, I assure the House that the Government is determined to implement the infrastructure programme set out in the NDP over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>In a scenario of rising costs it behoves us to ensure that all other elements which influence cost effective and timely infrastructure delivery <Col N="96" /> bear positively on the situation. The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and Public-Private Partnerships and the cross-departmental team which supports its work have been very active in this regard. The Cabinet committee has received and will continue to receive regular reports and oral presentations from the relevant implementing agencies on progress on the key infrastructural project in the NDP. In addition, the Cabinet committee and cross-departmental team have under ongoing consideration the legal, institutional and administrative obstacles which could impede the delivery of infrastructure under the plan. Among the steps taken to date arising from their deliberations are measures in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act which will enhance the statutory approval and judicial review process; additional resources for An Bord Pleanála, the NRA and Dúchas have established a code of practice to ensure co-ordination in regard to archaeological issues for major projects; the NRA has also put in place enhanced management procedures which will reduce delivery time for road projects; and a communications strategy for the NDP is being put in place.</P>
    <P>The deliverability issue is one of the key considerations behind the NDP communications strategy which is being developed. A key element of this strategy will be to ensure that the public, especially communities directly affected by NDP projects, are fully and openly informed about the NDP. A second key element of the communications strategy will be an information campaign aimed at key international companies in the sphere of infrastructural delivery with the objective of augmenting domestic capacity in this area.</P>
    <P>All of us are aware of instances where local controversies have arisen in relation to the impact of infrastructural projects. I do not for a moment wish to deny the right of individual groups and communities to voice valid concerns in relation to the impact of such developments on them. It is very important, however, that we also try to look at the bigger picture and the national interest in relation to these issues. If we cannot provide ourselves with the transport facilities, the proper environmental services, including waste management facilities, and necessary access to energy and communications networks, we will not create the conditions for continuing sustainable economic growth, nor will we assist the objective of a better regional balance in economic development.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government will work to ensure that the proper balance is maintained between speedy delivery of necessary infrastructure and the need to address any adverse consequences it may have on particular communities. It should be noted that there are structures in place to address concerns that may arise in relation to the planning, environmental and heritage implications of infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>We are only ten months into a seven-year plan. Given the scale of some of the infrastructure projects in the plan, it will be some time before sig<Col N="97" /> nificant progress will be visible on the ground. A key factor at present is the need to ensure that implementing agencies are proactively engaged in delivery on infrastructure and that other issues such as construction capacity are addressed. The Cabinet committee is actively engaged on these issues.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is a central element in the achievement of continuing sustainable economic growth, a more inclusive society and better regional balance in economic growth. I assure the House that we will be vigilant at the highest levels of Government in monitoring progress on the NDP. I look forward in the future to reporting to the House on a periodic basis on plan implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan is seriously off the rails. I am not surprised this is the case because the cart was put before the horse. The plan as published is, in effect, an amalgamation of the wish lists which were on the files of every county manager and county and city engineer. The level of spend proposed is enormous but because there was no spatial plan in place before all the project related plans were published, it is very difficult for the plan to progress on target.</P>
      <P>A spatial plan is being formulated. When the national development plan was published I was reliably informed that an assistant principal in the Department of the Environment and Local Government was spending half his time on the development of a spatial plan. I presume this has been geared up and that adequate resources have been made available to develop a spatial plan. However, I understand it will not be published within two years.</P>
      <P>This is a serious flaw as the spatial plan has to decide where people live and work, how they will get from home to work and is fundamental to a national plan. There may be some agenda within Departments which answers these questions but if there is, it certainly is not published. Where will the new growth centres be located? Where will the people live, where will they work and how will they move from one place to the other? How much movement will be by road, by public transport and by rail? What are the key decisions which underpin it? In the absence of answers to those questions there is bound to be a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another difficulty which arises from the enormity of the spend. The Minister's figures in the plan, which he repeated today, indicate that the proposed spend is £40.6 billion. It is difficult to know what is included in that. The capital component from the semi-State companies does not seem to be included in it. The extent to which the CIE spend is included is not clear. The FEOGA £1.7 billion seems to be excluded. Co-financing by the IDA for the establishment of industry is not included. If we factor in all the items not included, it seems to me that the total spend pro-<Col N="98" /> posed is about £50 billion. That is a great deal of money by any standards.</P>
    <P>Already we are falling behind significantly. One can see it in the roads programme, which includes the Kildare by-pass in the Minister's constituency. It is coming to the stage where this project is a cross between a national scandal and a national joke in that there is a bridge in the middle of nowhere, which I pass every morning on my way to Dublin. It is like a scene from post-war Bosnia, where this broken bridge is in the middle of the bogland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the contract has been awarded again.</P>
      <P>There is a recent example of this in Watergrasshill in County Cork, where the bonding system, which was included as an addition to the contract, was included as part of the tender documents and now the fellow who lodged the highest tender probably has a legal right to be awarded the contract because other people did not fill up the bond. These kinds of things should not happen at this stage of the development.</P>
      <P>There is a great inefficiency also in the co-ordination between the local authorities and the National Roads Authority and in the inability to come to conclusions when decisions must be made. In my constituency, Limerick city is being by-passed. Phase I is now constructed. This too leaves traffic in the middle of nowhere, out on the Ballysimon Road. Phase II, which will take one as far as the Dublin road, has not yet gone to tender but by then all the traffic will rush around the city and arrive at the city side of Adare, where it will stack up for the next ten years as it crawls through the village because the decision to put the Adare by-pass in place has not been taken yet. The obvious solution is to take a link road from the Adare by-pass across to the N69 to serve the port of Foynes but no decision has been taken. There is a decision to by-pass Adare but there has been no decision to link it to the N69. Therefore the pieces of the infrastructural proposals are not hanging together. They do not form a pattern. They are not being processed efficiently and already the plan is way behind schedule. With the enormous spend proposed, the only way the money will be spent now is, as the Minister suggested in his speech, if the accelerated cost of the projects hoover up the money, but we are not getting value for money even at this early stage in these projects. It is not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need not only a spatial plan but an implementation plan in parallel with the national plan. <Col N="99" /> I strongly suggest that the Minister immediately put in place an implementation plan to underpin this. I do not mean that he should establish a Cabinet sub-committee, although that may be the starting point. If targets are to be achieved, there must be people driving this every day of the week. They could start by talking to the Members of the House. Fianna Fáil Deputies will give him a list of anecdotes about how this is not working, how it is lagging behind and the problems which exist already. It is simply not working.</P>
    <P>We all know the problems in regard to roads. When I first came to this House, I used come from my house on the Cork road side of Limerick city to Kildare Street in two and three quarter hours. The roads have improved enormously since but the journey takes me a half an hour longer because of the density of traffic. Many of the improvements which have been made are outdated before they are commissioned. The Nenagh bypass is the latest improvement on my journey but it is single, not dual, carriageway. It is already out of date and therefore there are many attendant difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be familiar with the Roscrea ring-road on which there are all these roundabouts and intersections and only one flyover. In any proper development the crossing traffic should be separated from the through traffic. Therefore the projects coming on stream contain design deficiencies in the modern context and no longer fulfil the need, and there are other projects which are just being held up for all sorts of reasons.</P>
    <P>The problem of waste disposal is not being dealt with. Apart from speeches by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the notion that there are regional waste disposal plans, I do not know anywhere, where the plans have moved forward an inch and I know of several places where plans have fallen back a mile. We are in a worse situation than we were several years ago. One can name places all around the country where the people do not want landfill or incineration and the local authorities are not providing the facilities for environmentally conscious people, who want to segregate refuse and to dispose of it in an environmentally friendly way. Last week somebody told me at a constituency clinic that he was interested in protecting the environment but Limerick Corporation does not provide a facility where he can dispose of bottles near his home and where he can separate plastic, paper and organic material. No such segregation is being carried out. There is a great deal of guff and theory, but the environmentally friendly household cannot easily dispose of its refuse in a segregated way.</P>
    <P>The bottle banks are usually located at the large shopping centres, but one needs to own a car to get to them. If one goes into the flatland areas of cities and towns where many of the young people are environmentally conscious but <Col N="100" /> do not own cars, that is where one will find the people most educated on the environment but they will not get on a bus with two bags of bottles to dispose of them in the bottle bank out in the suburbs. If one provides facilities to the people like those available in Barcelona, for example, where there is a refined system of segregation in place, where, for example, once a month there is a collection of wooden materials such as old furniture and where they provide the facilities to the people, then people will behave responsibly. However what is happening here is that the people are being lectured to be environmentally friendly, the facilities are not put in place to facilitate this and then the big proposal is put up on the table and it is deadlocked. Most people I know will oppose incineration and landfill in their locality, but the only alternative is to reduce the amount of waste and that is the road which should be followed but it is not happening. There is a great deal of guff talked about it, there are seminars about it and there are pretty speeches published about it, but there is nothing provided locally for the person who wants to dispose of his or her refuse in an environmentally friendly way.</P>
    <P>There is also a shortage of staff and this will affect the plan. The Minister is aware of this but it is worth mentioning again. There are not sufficient staff in the planning offices, and certainly there are not enough in Dúchas. There is a shortage of archaeologists and major projects are being held up as a result. Practically anywhere one cuts a road one will come across an archaeologically significant site and there is nobody available to sort it out.</P>
    <P>This is not working. The best start would be for the Minister to call his parliamentary party together and have a chat with them. They will tell him the truth about what is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As people who do this class of job are wont to have to do on occasion, a few weeks ago I was looking at statistics for GDP <i>per capita.</i> They suggest that Ireland is fifth from the top of the OECD league in terms of GDP <i>per capita</i>, which is a measure of wealth determined by dividing national income by the number of people in the country or the number of workers. On the face of it, that makes us look like an extremely rich country and, I suppose, compared to where we were ten, 20 or 30 years ago, we are. All of us know there is another side to that coin, which is, the infrastructure, whether the social infrastructure, recreational facilities, the roads, waste management facilities or whatever. That is where the real poverty is. There is general consensus in this House that it needs to be addressed. That, I guess, is from where the national development plan came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that the plan is in very real trouble because it was not, and is not, really a plan. All that actually happened was that when we discovered one bright day last year or the year before last, or somebody in the Department of Finance suddenly decided we could <Col N="101" /> afford to spend a few quid on a few projects, they went around the various Department looking for submissions. In most cases, they got submissions which had been on the books for a number of years and they were put together as a plan. The amount was totted up, a figure was reached and it was published with a certain amount of ceremony last year.</P>
    <P>In some cases, Departments did not have plans on the stocks at all &ndash; in some cases, scandalously so. The Department of Public Enterprise, for example, even when asked, still could not produce anything resembling a convincing or persuasive plan for public transport in Dublin despite having had responsibility for that for countless decades. Even when asked for a wish list, it could not come up with one. We all know what has happened since and I will go into that in a few moments.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of problems with the plan but, I suppose, the principal difficulty we currently face is cost overruns, and this really has become an enormous problem. To take an example of one project close to my constituency &ndash; the Dublin port tunnel project &ndash; when it was first mooted about two or three years ago, we were talking about a figure of perhaps £120 million. Last year that figure rose to about £170 million and towards the end of last year, it was over the £200 million mark. Most recently, when the contract was awarded, the figure was a staggering £353 million. In addition to that, there will be a figure of an additional £80 million give or take, for supervision. There is also a need to acquire some land at Dublin port. This important project, which was originally to cost the taxpayer around £130 million, will now cost nearly four times that. I do not want to deal with the individual project as such, although we could ask serious questions about the cost benefit analysis of whether it still stacks up, but the point is that if this is happening in that project, I have no doubt it is happening in many similar projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The NRA first calculated that it could deal with its 1996 assessment of needs on the basis of something like £4 billion. That figure now stands at well more than twice that. The bottom line here is very clear; it is that the NRA, the Government and the national plan cannot deliver on the major road projects with the amount of money that is being set aside in the plan. I would like to know &ndash; the Minister of State is here now and obviously has a particular interest, for example, in the Waterford road &ndash; whether even the major motorways and dual carriageways can be, or will be, delivered within the period of the plan because all the indications are that the cost overruns are such that we simply cannot afford it unless Government decides to add additional money to what has already been set aside.</P>
    <P>One of the other difficulties from the point of view of roads is the nature of the contracts that have been awarded. There is consensus in this House that we need to think on a bigger scale, that we need to go for bigger contracts and for <Col N="102" /> longer stretches for road for any one contract. To do that, we would probably have to bring in contractors from abroad who will bring in their own work forces as well as everything else, but we are not doing that. I looked through the NRA's list of projects for this year, none of which is longer than the southern cross and the south eastern motorway which are about ten or 12 kilometres give or take. We are still not dealing with the lengths of motorway with which it will be necessary to deal to encourage in contractors from abroad. The Minister and the Taoiseach have said they will do it. I would like to give the Minister this opportunity to confirm that today and to indicate the sort of contracts and projects which we will put out to tender in the relatively near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left the House, but perhaps the other scandal about the Kildare by-pass is not that it has taken so long to build but that it was such a short project in the first place. We all know that once Kildare is by-passed, all we are really doing is postponing the difficulty to Monasterevin. Surely to goodness the same by-pass, the same stretch of road, could, and should, have been used to by-pass both towns and get around what has become a big headache for anybody travelling from Dublin to Limerick or Dublin to Cork.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that the spatial plan is a real difficulty. I read the report the Department of Environment and Local Government produced and I confess I thought it was a good report. However, it is several years too late. We needed to put this in place at the same time as the national development plan because obviously they fit hand in glove together. We have now encountered a strange difficulty, although perhaps not that strange, in that we have a spatial plan that is in the making but which will not be there for two years, we have strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin area which everybody is ignoring and we have roads infrastructure and, to some extent, a public transport infrastructure which is being put in place before everything else is in place. What we need is a Department, a Minister or somebody to drive all of this, to pull it all together and to take a strategic look at it. We cannot have somebody responsible for this, that or the other and everybody working to different plans which, unfortunately, is precisely what is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>One thing about which I was concerned when the plan was first produced was the whole issue of social inclusion. While social inclusion appears as a heading in the plan and there are subheadings dealing with issues such as child care and so on, one thing is singularly missing from the plan &ndash; I hope that in time some meat can be put on these bones &ndash; is the absence of any proposal to deal with areas of deprivation. It is assumed that if we deal with child care, adult education and various other issues, they will impact on areas of particular social deprivation. There is no effort made to highlight the perhaps 15 worst areas of <Col N="103" /> social deprivation, most of which are in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and to target them. That is not in the plan and I regret it because there is an urgent need for it.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the debate we had last year related to regionalisation which ultimately resulted in splitting the country into two regions. My major beef at that time was the absence of any regional authorities with real power. Developments since then have proved my case. My understanding is that the dominating hand of the Department of Finance is still very much in evidence in the way the regional authorities have dealt with the relatively small amount of money under their control.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the south eastern regional authority made decisions dealing with about 15% of the total spend in the south eastern area. That was fair enough in so far as it went but the remaining 85% is still being decided in Merrion Street. In reality, we do not have any regional or local control over the way projects are decided and the way money is spent. That is regrettable. I appreciate this does not happen overnight and that we cannot suddenly develop an additional layer of governance and decision making but we have to acknowledge there is need for that, that there is a will at local level to make decisions and that there is an expertise at local level in identifying need. We need to represent that on bodies which are both accountable and representative.</P>
    <P>There was also a debate last year about State aids and about the IDA strategy. I would be interested if the Minister could tell us whether there is tangible evidence of the redirection of effort by the IDA away from the east coast and Dublin towards the BMW area, in particular. We were given assurances at that time that there would be a refocusing of policy towards those areas. One year on, I would like to know whether there is any substantial evidence of that. I am also curious to know whether the issue of State aids, which we debated at such lengths a year and a half ago, has proved to be of any substance and whether the fact that State aids can now be given in the southern and eastern area on a far less generous basis has impacted or whether, conversely, in the BMW area, the IDA and others have found themselves providing State aids up to the maximum that is allowed under the regional policy of the European Union.</P>
    <P>All of us wish the plan well and the Government well in delivering what we all support and what the country clearly needs. There is a need to recognise that there are problems even in the first six or nine months in the delivery of the plan and in the plan itself in the way it relates to the various other plans &ndash; the spatial plan and the strategic guidelines developed. There is a need to draw all the proposals together and to ensure the plan is properly delivered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement on the <Col N="104" /> debate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, paid particular attention to the delivery of the ambitious expenditure programme for economic and social infrastructure in the national development plan. I return to this matter because doubts have been expressed about the deliverability of the infrastructure programme of the plan and because this element of it is essential to achieving the plan's objectives.</P>
      <P>The Government's determination that the infrastructure programme will be delivered is reflected in the fact that last year it set up a Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development, including a public private partnership, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and assisted by a cross-departmental team. The Government has already agreed a wide range of measures to streamline administrative, planning and legal procedures, which the committee recommended to it.</P>
      <P>While Deputy McDowell raised a number of questions about the plan, he must bear in mind that we are only ten months into its seven year timeframe. The Deputy's questions are relevant. It is very much the IDA's intention to maximise the benefits that will accrue to the BMW regions in terms of what is available there as opposed to the regions Deputy McDowell and I represent. I do not have an assessment of that at this stage.</P>
      <P>Amendments to the planning Bill, which the Government has adopted, include removing the statutory prohibition on infrastructural development being carried out pending the outcome of all legal procedures; requiring An Bord Pleanála to give priority to major infrastructural development&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments to the planning Bill also include providing for the High Court to deal expeditiously with legal proceedings in major infrastructural cases; that a person seeking judicial review must show a previous interest in the case unless exceptional circumstances can be shown and allowing An Bord Pleanála to decide on infrastructure projects that cross the foreshore without the need to apply for a separate foreshore licence from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>The combined impact of those steps will lead to a perceptible improvement in the speed with which infrastructural projects can be completed. Work is proceeding on other administrative and legal impediments to the speedy delivery of infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet committee's focus on infrastructure delivery has also galvanised the implementing agencies who are continuing to gear themselves to meet the daunting challenges <Col N="105" /> they face. They have improved management structures, devoted more resources to planning and are streamlining their procedures to meet these challenges. However, I would be the first to admit that without the necessary public support, no plan could be delivered on time or completely. This is particularly true of the major infrastructural projects envisaged in the national development plan. If there is public opposition to such projects, it will be very difficult to implement them. Consequently, it behoves all public representatives to get the message across to the public of the importance of infrastructure to present and future generations.</P>
    <P>If we do not have better roads and an efficient public transport system, it will become more and more costly and time consuming to move people and goods, which will inevitably have an adverse impact on regional and national competitiveness. Areas which do not have adequate power supplies or communications infrastructure will not be able to attract modern industries and services and, thus, balanced regional development will not be achieveable. An adequate housing stock is not only a necessary social requirement but also an important determinant of competitiveness. A lack of adequate waste management facilities to cater for waste associated with growth will become a constraint on growth. That point was enunciated here this evening. These are not fanciful speculations but acknowledgments of the reality we face. If we want continued social and economic development at national and regional level, we must provide the infrastructure necessary to support it. That means we will have to build better roads and more houses, improve our health care infrastructure, provide proper waste management facilities and other essential infrastructure. The national development plan provides the resources to do this. I stress all these elements of infrastructure will be constructed with full regard to their impact on our environment, heritage and quality of life.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a common experience that those who benefit from a measure remain passive and quiet, whereas those who are adversely affected are very vociferous in their complaints. Without denying anyone's rights, I plead for a reasoned and balanced debate on infrastructure projects and a recognition that there are independent agencies in place with full power to decide on the planning, environmental and heritage aspect of these projects. In such debates, the views of the general public, locally and regionally, can play a crucial role. In this context, people of influence, be they public representatives, social partners or other opinion shapers, can help the public to identify and express their interests. In particular, they must get the message across to the public that infrastructure projects are essential to future prosperity.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government will strive to ensure that a proper balance is maintained between speedy delivery of necessary infrastructure and the need to address any adverse con<Col N="106" /> sequences it may have on particular communities. There are structures in place to ensure any concerns there may be about the planning, environmental and heritage aspects of infrastructure are fully catered for.</P>
    <P>This is the most ambitious plan ever undertaken by the State. Its full and speedy implementation will support continued sustainable growth in the economy and address regional and social imbalances.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McDowell's question about motorways, it is the Government's determination to deliver on those within the seven year timeframe of the plan. Built into many of those projects is the possibility of a public-private partnership. I have no doubt that if everyone concerned co-operates such projects will be delivered on time.</P>

      <P>The time strictures on the debate are such that many Deputies will not have an opportunity to express their widespread concern about the lack of action by the Government on the delivery of the national development plan. The Minister of State was extremely defensive in his contribution. The position in An Bord Pleanála is a joke. Is he aware that every appellant and respondent who has papers before the board has received correspondence to the effect that none of the appeals will be held within the next few months? Decisions on applications have been postponed for three months, a further three months and then a further six months. The damage that is doing to the potential for development here is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has the neck to talk about a requirement that An Bord Pleanála must give priority to major infrastructural development, but that is not happening. He also spoke about motorways. Deputies McDowell and Noonan referred to the traffic gridlock in Kildare, which is a scandal. What action will the Government take to deal with the traffic congestion in Kildare while the construction of the bypass is awaited, given that hundreds of thousands of pounds per day are being lost to the economic life of my constituency? Important meetings are being cancelled or rescheduled because people cannot get into, out of or through Kildare. The county council washes its hands of the issue. Trucks and buses are parking virtually in the middle of the main street. The gardaí, the National Roads Authority and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government do not want to know about the problem. The situation is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There used to be a tall Garda stationed at O'Connell Bridge when I was a child. He stood on a white bollard and wore a white glove up to his elbow. That fellow shifted the traffic. I want him brought out of retirement and sent to Kildare and paid enough money to do what he did on O'Connell Bridge 30 years ago, to get the traffic <Col N="107" /> moving through Kildare. It is a fairly simple operation. A Garda should be on duty in Kildare town from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and paid overtime to shift the traffic. Nobody seems to care about the traffic gridlock there.</P>
    <P>We have been told that £13.3 billion, a staggering amount of money, will be spent on the BMW regions, yet the Government has not decided on the gateway or growth centres that will be the recipients of this money or the major infrastructural projects that will be provided. They are not mentioned in this plan. The Government refused to bite the bullet in terms of setting out the specifics of this plan. The amount allocated in the plan of £13.3 billion cannot be spent until decisions are made as to what places in the Border, Midlands and Western regions will be designated as growth centres.</P>
    <P>The population of Portlaoise is growing at an alarming rate. It is estimated that in ten years' time the current population of the town will have doubled from 9,000 to 18,000 and in a further ten years it will have exceeded 30,000. We cannot cope with that level or development or rate of growth. Every application for housing development is appealed by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board to An Bord Pleanála where there is gridlock because the Government failed to approve the main drainage scheme for Portlaoise. Out of the total expenditure of £13.3 billion allocated for the BMW regions, £550,000 is required for that scheme, but the Government will not make that amount available to enable housing developments to take place in a town in which people, commuters or those who work in the town, have decided to reside.</P>
    <P>This plan is moving too slowly. There is not a co-ordinating umbrella body that will produce the necessary impetus to progress these matters. The Minister of State mentioned seven years three times in his speech. A year ago it was five years and six months ago it was six years. Now the Minister of State says seven years three times in his speech, which is a further indication of the long finger approach of the Government.</P>

Mr. Liam Connellan says it will be open by 2006 but we have not been informed if it will be a toll road or where it will be. We cannot get the report of the public inquiry on the Heath-Mayfield bypass. That took place in July but the report still has not been published.

      <P>I know it is difficult for the Opposition to recognise the positives in what is happening, but the Minister of State was right to point out that this is a £40 billion programme, £36 billion of which comes from Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>Regarding the last speaker's comments, where one has a county manager and team that is progressive and willing to get on with business, one will see progress. My constituency comes under Fingal County Council and the management team under Mr. Willie Soffe is absolutely proactive and the Fingal area will see the benefits of this plan. Housing, drainage and motorways will be fast-tracked &ndash; as quickly as the Ministers make the announcements we have a team in place to deal with them. When we are asked to account for this work in a couple of years we will see the benefits of this plan.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of Opposition speeches seems to be what will not be done under the national plan, but I will concentrate on one sector that will benefit from the national plan, the horticultural sector, which is very important to my area. There is a possibility that £40 million will be invested in this industry under the national plan. Subject to clearance under this plan, that industry is waiting for the opportunity to spend that money. The industry is awaiting some capital investment for regeneration. I was told in the past week that the industry was asked by the multiples which supply the main market share here and in the export sector to increase its production by 50%. The industry would welcome the proposal for a 35% capital grant aid for the redevelopment of the area &ndash; for new glasshouses &ndash; so that it can compete. Some years ago the industry nearly went under due to the price of oil and it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who made sure that the area received natural gas. That allowed this labour intensive industry to compete not only in Dublin but all over the country. The issue some years ago&mdash;</P>

When this plan is implemented the £35 million to £40 million earmarked for the area, with the 35% capital grant, will allow the industry to compete internationally.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Opposition, it is not so long ago that it raised the question of how the industry would survive and sought subvention. There is no call for that now because the industry can compete on cost terms. The national plan's proposal will allow the industry to regenerate and develop. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the funding is provided for those operators with one or two acres and not the multiples. That will allow the industry to develop.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister for Finance describe how we were ten months into a seven year plan and how the plan is to achieve sustainable economic growth. Does the Minister of State genuinely believe that economic growth can be sustainable over the long term given that it involves consumption of considerable amounts of national capital, such as oil?</P>
      <P>There is a need to look at plan B. This is plan A which basically proposes business as usual except that we need more, more roads and more consumption. One could argue that that is how things will have to be, given the way things are going, but I am looking at plan B. I was elected to look into the future and to see what the long-term prospects would be for this and future generations, but I do not see that in this plan.</P>
      <P>I see many breaches of Article B of the Amsterdam Treaty, which refers to balanced and sustainable development &ndash; that is not the same as sustainable growth. There are breaches of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and of the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gases. It is impossible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol the way this plan is framed, which will land us with enormous fines after 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been better to have spatial planning here first, and while there is spatial planning in the plan, it assumes continued, infinite access by all areas to use of the private car. That is fine for the moment for those who have cars and while energy prices are stable, but the situation will not remain that way. We know congestion costs Dublin half a billion pounds and that health costs are caused by emissions. The rail aspect of the plan focuses on safety, which is laudable. I support that good aspect, but it is inadequate. Deputy Wright can testify that I was turfed off the Balbriggan-Dublin train at Malahide. I did not have integrated ticketing so I could not get on <Col N="110" /> a bus to travel the rest of the way and hundreds of others were in the same situation.</P>
    <P>Waste is a significant challenge for the Government, for all Members and for everyone in the country. We must state clearly that incineration and landfill developments should not receive State investment. They should not be assisted because they are at the bottom of the waste hierarchy. In regard to horticulture, I agree with Deputy Wright that there is a need to support that sector. However, the organic growing sector has been badly let down by the Government. In addition, no effort has been made to incorporate the concepts of renewable energy, energy conservation or solar power in the type of houses being built at present. We have missed a major opportunity in that regard.</P>

        <b>:</b> Democratic socialists are committed to economic planning, provided it is for the benefit of people and society. It is difficult to be convinced that the Government is serious about economic planning when we have already entered the period governed by the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, and a spatial strategy has not yet been published. This reminds me of Columbus who headed west into the broad expanse of ocean expecting to find India but stumbled across a place he did not know existed. The Government appears to be proceeding in the same way.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the idea of a new city which is being mooted. Balanced regional and county development are what is required. However, what confidence can we have in this Government to draw up a balanced regional plan when we consider what happened with the decentralisation of Government Departments? Ministers grabbed Departments under their control with all the grace of rugby players picking a ball out of a ruck and then raced to the line, be it located in Cahirciveen, Tullamore or Galway West. If we are to see a repeat in respect of the national development plan, let us forget about it.</P>
      <P>With regard to public private partnerships, what guarantees are there that private sector interests will live up to the commitment to spend £6.4 billion? What percentage of the £40.5 billion will be invested by the private sector and what percentage will be invested by the public sector?</P>
      <P>It is shameful that we are proposing to spend double the amount on the roads as on the rail network. Have we not learned from the mistake of not developing public transport in recent years?</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the national development plan is one of the most important and wide-ranging plans ever presented by any Government. It is important to welcome the positive nature of the plan, particularly the commitment to develop those regions and <Col N="111" /> sections of society which continue to be excluded from the prosperity and development enjoyed by others. Debates of this nature are essential to monitor the plan's implementation and must continue throughout its lifetime. We need to see real progress on the implementation of the plan in the key and critical areas of health, education, child care and infrastructural development.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on one area without which the plan will not succeed. I refer here to child care and the need for a commitment to make real provision in that regard. Under the heading of &ldquo;Equality&rdquo; the plan commits £250 million for child care provision in the regional operational programmes. This is but a fraction of what is needed, both regionally and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A report published earlier this month showed the extent of need in the North Eastern Health Board area. There are 884 children on waiting lists for the 213 child care providers in that region, comprising Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan. This is only the tip of the iceberg. It represents the need among those who can afford the limited provision available and does not account for the thousands more for whom current provision is beyond their means. What value development if children are not properly catered for? We must ensure that children receive the best care, preferably by a parent or guardian on a full-time basis or else, where needed, by qualified people whose service is affordable or accessible.</P>
      <P>In addition to the resources earmarked in the plan and to those announced last week by the Government, a further commitment is needed which will really show the determination of the Administration to prioritise this issue. I hope the Minister of State and the Minister will report to Cabinet that I wish to propose that the full amount of revenue accruing from payment of previously unpaid DIRT by financial institutions be devoted to the provision of child care. That decision would certainly indicate real intent and purpose. I commend this proposal to Government and urge it to make it a central part of the forthcoming budgetary measures.</P>

        <b>:</b> The decision by Aer Lingus clerical staff to withdraw their services tomorrow will paralyse the national carrier once <Col N="112" /> again and create major problems for up to 20,000 passengers. It is the third successive week that Aer Lingus services have been thrown into disarray. Two weeks ago baggage handlers withdrew their services for two successive days with the result that chaos ensued and with a knock-on effect for several hours even after the staff returned to work. On Tuesday of last week the entire Aer Lingus fleet was grounded because cabin crews withdrew their services.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow when the Aer Lingus desks at Dublin, Shannon and Cork should be buzzing with November bank holiday activity, they will be silent and empty because of the clerical staff industrial action. Today comes the announcement that the clerical staff last night decided on a 24 hour stoppage on Friday week. Along with the baggage handlers, 500 Aer Lingus pilots yesterday resumed their work protest by refusing to work on rest days. They are seeking pay increases in line with their peers in the One World Alliance. As this action begins to bite, it will have the capacity to cause absolute havoc over a protracted period. The problems of wages and conditions for catering staff are still the subject of ongoing talks.</P>
      <P>If one set out to deliberately create industrial relations chaos one could scarcely have made a better job than the present sorry state of industrial relations within Aer Lingus where five separate disputes are ongoing. The entire Aer Lingus staff of 6,000 is now in dispute with the company. These disputes did not all come crashing out of the clear blue sky. They were simmering and festering beneath the surface for a long period. Instead of addressing the problems on an individual basis, they were ignored in the vain hope that they would go away. The result is that the task of obtaining a successful interlocking agreement with five separate groups is extremely difficult as each group understandably watches the others in terms of the improved wage increases and conditions on offer.</P>
      <P>The blame for the present chaos must lie with the company and with the Minister, who owns the company and who did not move in time to address the individual sectoral problems as they arose. Had this happened, the crescendo of chaos with which we are now faced need not have happened. In this era of the Celtic tiger, if the Minister, who owns the national airline on behalf of the people, cannot guarantee that it provides a reliable and efficient service to the people, she should consider her position. I would like the Minister to inform the House about the steps she, her Department and the company will take to end this disruption and humiliation of what was once a proud national flagship company.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for sharing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to indicate the action she <Col N="113" /> has taken since special notice questions were taken in the House in respect of the first strike in Aer Lingus, to make the management of the company see and appreciate that its staff are low paid. It is clear that the management seem more keen on waging a public relations battle than getting to grips with the real problems experienced by the company's staff who made that company what it is now. A total of 97% of clerical workers rejected a previous offer and the company has insulted them by returning with almost the same offer.</P>
    <P>The shock at the low pay regime operated by Aer Lingus was shared by everyone when it was revealed in recent weeks. Aer Lingus workers have been hammered in the past ten years when their wages and conditions were pegged back. During the same period no such restraint was placed on house prices in Dublin, Cork and Limerick where the employees of Aer Lingus reside. How can staff on less than £5 per hour afford to live? This is the case with many clerical workers beginning their careers in Aer Lingus. What is the commitment of management to meeting the genuine complaints and needs of its staff, who are the basis on which the company was built? The commitment of management to public enterprise must be questioned. The axemen who boasted of having dealt with disputes in Waterford Glass and elsewhere are not the people to put a genuine public sector company on course for development and growth. I question the company's commitment to public enterprise and wonder whether the privatisation of Aer Lingus, which the Minister is contemplating and planning, is what it is thinking about in relation to the low pay strategy and so on which it is currently enforcing on its staff. I also wonder whether its failure to deal with that low pay regime was determined by an effort to keep money in the profit account rather than rewarding the workers who made these profits possible, so that when the Minister shamefully puts the company on the market, the price paid by the vultures waiting to move in will be greater than might otherwise be the case. These are the questions with which the Minister should deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for encouraging and endorsing this debate.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret the inconvenience caused to Aer Lingus customers as a result of ongoing industrial disputes in the company. I am very much aware of their implications on tourism, consumer and business sectors in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute tomorrow relates to the SIPTU clerical staff who are planning a stoppage of four hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. Aer Lingus has prepared contingency plans in the event of the four hour stoppage tomorrow. It is expected that more than <Col N="114" /> 80% of flights from the normal schedule will operate. Thirty five flights of the 260 scheduled for Friday have been cancelled. Flights departing before 10 a.m. are expected to operate normally, while flights scheduled to depart after 3 p.m. will be subject to delays.</P>
    <P>Contingency plans announcing a revised schedule for Friday have been widely communicated by Aer Lingus on its website, in the national newspapers and through the travel trade. The objective is to minimise disruption to customers by maximising the use of available resources. Priority has been given to those customers travelling longer distances. I am closely monitoring the situation and I have been in regular contact with the chairman whom I met yesterday for a further update. Deputies will recall that in response to Private Notice Questions early last week, I urged on management and unions an intensification of efforts to resolve the various matters at issue, making full use of the State's labour relations machinery. I also acknowledged, and do so again, that there is a low pay issue which has been addressed. I appreciate that there has been an intensification of efforts on both sides.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has told me that in recent negotiations with SIPTU representatives of the clerical staff, the company made an offer that marks a significant advance on the previous offer which was recommended by the Labour Court, having been through conciliation in the Labour Relations Commission. That offer was rejected. It is Aer Lingus's view that the clerical committee's counter proposal, if accepted, would significantly jeopardise future profitability at the airline. Aer Lingus continues to be available for talks at any time to progress this issue to a resolution.</P>
    <P>In addition to clerical staff talks, there has been a series of discussions and negotiations with the baggage handlers, middle management, catering staff and cabin crews either directly or under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. In relation to baggage handlers, the staff are now considering an offer from the company. Talks continued with the catering staff yesterday evening and middle management talks will resume following an adjournment, once a new date has been agreed.</P>
    <P>Having attended the Labour Relations Commission with the IMPACT cabin crew representatives last week, the company returned last Tuesday, 24 October, with SIPTU cabin crew at the request of the commission. The LRC has invited all the parties to attend talks on Tuesday, 31 October 2000.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has accepted that there is an issue of low pay for certain sectors of the workforce and has indicated its willingness to settle the pay and other claims in a fair and equitable manner, having regard to the viability of the company. These claims can only be addressed through discussion and negotiation. It is in no one's interest <Col N="115" /> to have continuous disruptions to the airline's operations which impact on the innocent public and the economy and which would ultimately undermine the viability of Aer Lingus. I urge all parties concerned to continue their direct talks to achieve a resolution to these disputes and, if necessary, continue to use the State's industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged on all sides of the House that adjustments are necessary in pay and conditions for certain sectors of the Aer Lingus workforce, having regard to the sacrifices and restraint which were called for from the staff in order to save the airline six years ago. I have made it clear to the Chairman of Aer Lingus that I strongly share that view, while confirming to him that the Government's mandate to the board continues to be the maintenance of the commercial viability of the airline going forward. I believe it is possible, through negotiation, to find the balance between those imperatives, which I do not believe are mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>The situation which appertained in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and with which the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government wrestled and settled through the Cahill plan at the end of 1994, imposed very real restraints on staff, followed by a three year cycle of very rigorous pay restraint. We must not return to that situation because, if we do, the airline will not be viable. If the company is not viable, the Government cannot invest money in it by virtue of EU diktat. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the very strong needs of the low paid and the equally strong needs of the airline to remain a commercially viable entity. I cannot emphasise enough the seriousness of the matter.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>)<b>: </b>I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment because the replies from the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the last occasion were as woolly as I expected, that is, that these issues were the responsibility of the health boards. This is the standard reply to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might seem strange definitions for those who are not aware of the problem. This was new information for me when a parent of two people who suffer from the disorder briefed me on it. This parent went to Canada and England to do research on the disorder and received very little help in Ireland. When she asked for support here, a consultant psychiatrist said to her, &ldquo;That cannot be prescribed in Ireland, you should go to England to get it, and anyway most of these people end up in jail.&rdquo;  It <Col N="116" /> was not very consoling for a professional to say this to a concerned parent. When one of the people in prison who suffers from this disorder told the psychiatrist there, he said glibly, &ldquo;Ah, sure we all suffer from ADD.&rdquo;  Perhaps he does and perhaps he should not be there at all. Nevertheless this is outrageous and extremely serious because many people end up in jail. The difficulty is that their impulse makes them do things and, until matters are under control, they may break the law.      </P>
    <P>Where in Ireland can this disorder be treated? As a doctor, I am sure the Minister of State will not read the gobbledygook with which he is provided. Where in Ireland can people who suffer from this serious disorder receive treatment? If treatment is not available in Ireland, will the Minister for Health and Children pay for treatment in England? Patients should not have to go to England or Canada for treatment. Where can this parent find treatment for her family? Excuses will be made that the disorder is difficult to define and have assessed. Some health boards do not want to carry out assessments but tell patients to have assessments done themselves. I got a lot of information on the Internet and it seems there are very clear lines defining whether one suffers from the disorder. It is extremely difficult. Children are given a drug up to the age of 12 and this is where the problem begins. They must receive medical care. It is unfair that people end up in jail and are told to cop themselves on. I hope to receive a realistic answer from the Minister so that I can tell a concerned parent where to get treatment.</P>

      <P>Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD, /Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD, is an internationally recognised condition of brain dysfunction. It is a complicated and variable condition with many different presentations. The combination of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behaviour is recognised as a disorder when these behaviours are severe, developmentally inappropriate and impair functioning at home or at school. ADD/ADHD was first recognised as recently as the 1980s. Researchers disagree on the exact causes of the disorder. However, there are two aspects of the condition which are more or less agreed upon &ndash; it is an inherited condition and the problem of the condition results from a subtle difference in the fine tuning of the brain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ADD/ADHD is a clinical diagnosis. There is no test for establishing the presence of the condition. The gradient of dysfunctional intensity can vary greatly and it is important to seek evidence of other psychological conditions such as stress <Col N="117" /> disorders and adjustment reactions before a definitive diagnosis and treatment programme may be undertaken. A physical examination is useful in ruling out issues such as hearing problems or neurological conditions.</P>
    <P>Until recently most child psychiatrists believed that ADD/ADHD improved in adolescence and disappeared in adulthood. However, more recent research and observation indicates that 25% of children with ADD/ADHD still meet the criteria in early adulthood, dropping to 8% by their late twenties. Sixty per cent of children retain at least one disabling symptom in adulthood. Adults with ADD/ADHD can experience excesses such as over-eating, over-spending and over-working. In the workplace they have often lost workdays and change jobs frequently.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the Minister's reply to Deputy Browne's question on 19 October, the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of ADD/ADHD is provided for children by consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists. A working group was established by the Department of Health and Children in June to review the child and adolescent psychiatric services and to finalise a plan for their further development. Among the priority issues being addressed by this group is the need for further development of services for children with ADD/ADHD. An interim report from the group is expected later this year.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, until recently most child psychiatrists believed ADD/ADHD improved in adolescence and disappeared in adulthood. It is important that treatment is maintained, if necessary, into adulthood for those who were diagnosed at school or in early childhood with ADD/ADHD and have been receiving care and treatment throughout their lives in the child and adolescent services. At present adults who present with ADD/ADHD are seen by consultant psychiatrists working within the general psychiatric services. The consultant determines the appropriate treatment, refers patients to appropriate services and prescribes medication if required.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering whether there may be a case for the further development of the adult psychiatric services in this regard. However, the development of appropriate services for children is the priority and, as I have outlined, that is being addressed by my Department at present. I hope that gives the Deputy some insight into the problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boylan has given notice of his intention to raise the matter of the future use of the mammography equipment in Cavan General Hospital which has lain idle since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this important issue and the Minister for taking the question. I am sure the Minister is aware of the position in Cavan General Hospital. A mammography machine was placed in Cavan General Hospital on the recommendation of the National Cancer Forum in 1997 and has lain idle since. It is scandalous, unacceptable and outrageous. When the machine was put in place and two rooms prepared for its operation, the Friends of Cavan General Hospital, a fund-raising support group, set about fund-raising for the commissioning of this machine and have £75,000 in a bank account for that purpose. To date, nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>I attended a public meeting in Cavan town hall on Monday night week, one of the largest I have attended since coming into politics. There were over 700 people present. Two coaches with people from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's area of Monaghan came to support us. There is no dissension within the Cavan-Monaghan constituency as to where this machine should be placed. Not only does the catchment area embrace Cavan and Monaghan but people in North Leitrim, Fermanagh and parts of Meath, will avail of this service.</P>
      <P>It is well known in medical circles, and the Minister of State being a doctor will be aware of how important it is to encourage women to go for early screening. As a layman I listen to the medical people. Mr. Joyce, senior consultant at Cavan General Hospital, a very honourable man who attended that meeting and was not afraid to do so, stated that early detection can bring about 100% success in the treatment of cancer. When commissioned this mammography machine can detect a cancer growth as small as a pinhead. How can the Minister, Minister of State and the Department turn their backs on the people of Cavan-Monaghan? It is not only women but men who are afflicted by this problem. How can the Minister suggest that this machine will be taken out of Cavan General Hospital under a proposal by the North Eastern Health Board and placed in Drogheda? It is a waste of public funds.</P>
      <P>The machine will not be taken out of that hospital because the people will not allow it. Is that anarchy? No, it is people standing up for their rights. We demand that this service be put in place. We demand that the Minister of State makes a clear categorical statement that the machine will now be commissioned. Nothing else will be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect that the North Eastern Health Board is capable of making a decision on this <Col N="119" /> issue. The members will not agree on it, to their eternal shame, but I hold out some hope for it. A new chief executive officer, Mr. Paul Robinson, has been appointed and I wish him well. It is early days but he has quite a task.</P>
    <P>Services at the hospital must be improved. We cannot allow any further downgrading to occur. We are not second-class citizens and we will accept nothing less than the basic services to which we are entitled. Why suggest that the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim should travel to Drogheda when the people of Louth have this service in Beaumont Hospital which is only up the road from them? Are all the services to be moved to the east coast? Does the Minister intend to deny the Midland and Border region a service to which it is entitled? </P>
    <P>In a reply to Deputy McManus yesterday it was stated that a mammography machine in Navan hospital has been closed down since last July. What has the North Eastern Health Board done about that? It recommended that patients should go to the Blackrock Clinic. I could not believe that but it is written in black and white. What is happening? Have the Minister and the Department lost the run of themselves?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and am pleased to have the opportunity afforded to me to inform the House of the position on the provision of specialist breast cancer services in the North Eastern Health Board area, on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the provision of medical services at Cavan General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that at the request of my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, the former Minister for Health and Children, the national cancer forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group was asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; <Col N="120" /> and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
    <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought regarding how the service should be developed in their region. In this context, the co-regional directors of cancer services in the North Eastern Health Board, Dr. Deborah Condell and Mr. Finbarr Lennon, were involved in this process. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer. The report of the sub-group of the cancer forum recommends that the population of the North Eastern Health Board justifies the development of one specialist breast disease unit.</P>
    <P>My colleague. Deputy Micheál Martin, has received the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. While he has taken no final decisions regarding implementation arrangements at health board level, he has established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group recently met North Eastern Health Board officials and clinicians and I understand that following this, the board will develop its plans in this area and submit them to the Department for approval and funding.</P>
    <P>I hope, in this process, Cavan will be given due recognition. No decision has been taken so everything remains to be fought for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom plé leis an gceist seo. Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an t-Aire Stáit anseo. Tá súil orm gur féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh sa díospóireacht ghearr a bhéas againn inniú.</P>
      <P>This issue involves a change in road traffic regulations, which must be done at national level, to allow motor cyclists to use the quality bus corridors which are becoming a common feature in Dublin and other large towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I was on a motorbike was about 20 years ago when I was given a lift on one to <Col N="121" /> an anti-nuclear demonstration in Carnsore. The journey scared the wits out of me and I have not been on one of the machines since. However, for those brave souls who use this form of transport, we should do as much as possible to ensure that they do so in safety.</P>
    <P>Where quality bus corridors have been put in place the road space available to the rest of the traffic is reduced and is aligned in narrow lanes which just about accommodate a vehicle. The result is that there is even less space available for motorcyclists. Rather than travel close to the footpath, as they would have done in the past, they now travel in the centre of the road and are obliged to weave in and out through the traffic. This came to my attention when a particularly zealous garda who was carrying out his duty and enforcing the law at Fairview Strand in Dublin seemed to be making a point of bringing to book motor cyclists who were using the bus lane.</P>
    <P>We can easily imagine the frustration of motor cyclists. They have a lane which is used by buses and pedal cyclists but which is clear most of the time. This has obvious advantages for the motor cyclists who can clearly see where they are going, travel in a straight line and get to where they are going relatively quickly without having to weave in and out through traffic. It is also of benefit to the rest of the traffic. Other car users can easily see a motor cyclist. At the moment couriers, for example, typically weave in and out of the spaces between cars and this causes difficulties for motor cyclists, drivers of private cars and pedestrians.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes tabled a question which was responded to by the Minister of State a few weeks ago, but the response was disappointing. The Minister of State pointed out that the matter is one for regulation and that the UK authorities recently conducted pilot schemes to study the safety benefits of the use of bus lanes. I suggest to the Minister of State that if we are to rely on pilot schemes they should at least be Irish pilot schemes. I urge him to consider the possibility of running a pilot scheme in this country. Our road conditions, traffic conditions and the volume of traffic on our roads are different from the UK. I do not know where the UK pilot schemes were done but there are serious differences between the way we organise traffic and public transport in this city and the way it is done in many UK cities. If we are to rely on the evidence of pilot schemes we should carry out one in this country rather than rely on evidence from abroad.</P>
    <P>When this matter first came to my attention I took it through the democratic machinery of Dublin Corporation and, not surprisingly, I got the support of councillor colleagues. More significantly, the proposal also got the support of the corporation management and traffic engineers. We are now in the bizarre situation where the representative and management levels of Dublin Corporation believe this is a worthwhile thing to do but it cannot happen because someone in the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="122" /> Government has decided, based on evidence from abroad, that we should not do it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look again at the request I hope he has received from Dublin Corporation, to consider the merits of the case &ndash; I believe it stands up on safety grounds &ndash; and, if he is so minded, to introduce a pilot scheme so that we can assess the safety benefits to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDowell for raising this important matter. Bus priority measures are now acknowledged internationally as an important instrument of urban transport management. There has been extensive investment in such measures, grant assisted by the Dublin Transportation Office, in the Dublin area. A new funding mechanism has been put in place this year by my Department to accelerate traffic management initiatives in major urban areas outside Dublin. The primary purpose and focus of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to facilitate mass transport in urban areas. Responsibility for the provision of bus lanes and for determining the hours of operation rests with the individual road authorities concerned. In the case of Dublin, proposals for quality bus corridors are being implemented by the Dublin local authorities in conjunction with Bus Átha Cliath and under the co-ordination of the Dublin Transportation Office.</P>
      <P>Access to bus lanes has been restricted to buses, large public service vehicles and, in relation to with-flow bus lanes only, taxis. Pedal cyclists have also been afforded access to with-flow bus lanes, primarily in view of road safety considerations. Requiring pedal cyclists to ride in the main traffic lane, with buses passing on their near side, would increase their exposure to accident risk. A more proactive promotion of pedal cycling as a transport mode has been advanced through the more recent introduction of quality bus corridors which are commonly provided with associated dedicated cycle tracks for pedal cyclists.</P>
      <P>I am advised that current traffic management is still against access to bus lanes for motor cyclists. This is not necessitated on road safety grounds in the same way as for pedal cyclists and could compromise the safe cycling environment for pedal cyclists which bus lanes and quality bus corridors aim to provide. Accordingly, there are no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to other vehicles, including motor cycles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the United Kingdom authorities have adopted a position against allowing motor cycles to use bus lanes. A guide to traffic management to assist buses in urban areas, Keeping Buses Moving, published by the Department of the Environment in the United Kingdom in 1991, which examined the issue of allowing motor cycles to use bus lanes, reported that motor cycles have more power than pedal cycles and can main<Col N="123" /> tain their position to a larger degree in the traffic stream and so are not at risk in the same way. More recently, I understand the United Kingdom authorities have introduced several pilot schemes to study the safety aspects of the use of bus lanes by motor cycles to both motor cyclists and pedal cyclists alike. These studies have proven inconclusive and the United Kingdom authorities are <Col N="124" /> maintaining their policy that motor cycles should not be allowed to use bus lanes.</P>
    <P>Against this background the maintenance of the <i>status quo </i>in the matter by the Irish authorities is both prudent and reasonable. I will give consideration to the Deputy's suggestion that practical pilot tests be undertaken here.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 November 2000.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the latest position in his discussions with the horse racing bodies regarding the proposed tax package to fund the establishment of a new single authority to govern horse racing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of last year, I proposed that the horse racing bodies be amalgamated into a single governing structure to achieve desirable levels of rationalisation, efficiency and other improvements within the industry. This goal was shared by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and virtually all the existing organisations within Irish horseracing, and it is therefore not surprising that our proposal was largely well received and given serious consideration by the relevant bodies from the outset.</P>
      <P>Following a period of intensive negotiations and consultations between Department of Agriculture officials and representatives of industry organisations earlier in the year, the Minister for Agriculture and I announced our detailed proposals on 28 July 2000. Although these proposals were generally welcomed, the Turf Club and the Association of Irish Racecourses expressed reservations on some issues.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with the Association of Irish Racecources on 13 September, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development officials agreed a number of measures to address the main issues of concern to them. Officials of that Department subsequently met members of the Turf Club on the 25 September and again on 19 October. Following these meetings, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I met with senior stewards of the Turf Club on 19 October. Following lengthy and intensive discussions, we agreed a framework by which the outstanding concerns of the Turf Club can be fully addressed.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this agreement, it is our belief that the conditions now exist for the establishment of the proposed new governing body for the Irish horseracing industry. The new body is to be provided with a secure source of funding which will equate to the proceeds of the tax on off-course betting allocated on a 4:1 ratio between the horse and greyhound industries. It is expected that this arrangement will eliminate the need for the Exchequer grant assistance which is allocated to the industry at present. With this objective in mind, I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is shortly to begin the process by which the necessary legislation can be put before the House as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any officials in my Department have been invited to participate in discussions on the international significance of the Tobin Tax.</P>
      <P>The Tobin Tax seeks to impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development.</P>
      <P>The issue was discussed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, on 12 January last. Officials of my Department attended the meeting. The chairman of the committee acknowledged that Ireland could not act unilaterally in the matter. He also pointed to the practical difficulties that would be caused at EU level by such a tax given that not all EU members are participating in the euro. In the case of this country we also have to be mindful that we have a much higher level of trade and capital flows with currencies outside the euro zone compared to other euro countries. Therefore, the tax is likely to have a disproportionate impact on Irish business and consumers. Were Ireland to take this matter up at EU level it could be perceived as amounting to a proposal for tax harmonisation, albeit in a discrete area. This might have implications for our overall policy position with respect to the role of the EU regarding taxation matters.</P>
      <P>While the motives of those seeking to impose such a tax are understandable there is some debate on the theoretical merits of the tax. However, as I have stated in replies to previous parliamentary questions on the matter, leaving aside the issues of theory associated with the proposal &ndash; there were still substantial practical difficulties in relation to the tax. These stem largely from enforcement problems. Global co-operation would be required for the tax to become workable. Otherwise, foreign exchange business would gravitate quickly to any country that did not enforce the tax. In this light, the probability of every country in the world applying such a tax, or of one country applying it unilaterally, must be open to question.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, section 1.1.8 states: &ldquo;The Government and the social partners acknowledge the role of ESOTs, gain sharing, profit sharing and other financial employee incentives in developing and deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness. A consultative committee, involving ICTU, IBEC and appropriate Government departments and agencies, will be established to prepare proposals for consideration in the context of Budget 2001&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The committee has been established and has held five meetings to date and there have also been a number of bilateral meetings with ICTU and IBEC.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the whole area of employee financial participation is a complex one and I await the conclusions of the committee with interest. I am not opposed in principle to introducing changes in this area. But, of course, I would have to be fully satisfied that any such changes would not facilitate tax planning.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is not customary for the Minister for Finance to indicate in advance what measures, if any, will be taken in the budget. I do not propose to depart from this practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 75, 113 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 6.2 % in the year to September 2000. The rate as measured by the EU-harmonised HICP was 5.5 % in September, and was the highest in the EU. The EU HICP average was 2.5 % in September, while that of the Eurozone was 2.8 %.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department published last August in its <Col N="131" /> economic review and outlook an average inflation estimate of 5.25 % for this year. It will publish its next inflation forecast with the budget which will cover both this year and the period 2001-03.</P>
    <P>Inflation this year has been higher than expected and, as is well known, this is due to a variety of external, once-off and domestic factors. However, despite the recent increase in inflation employees have, this year, received increases in take home pay of between 10% and 14%.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to control inflation. This is because the recent increase in inflation has the potential to adversely affect our competitiveness and undermine economic growth. A balance must be achieved between improving living standards and sustaining competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has worked in the past and the Government is confident that by working together with the social partners we can overcome our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, a number of measures to combat inflation were introduced in June. These included measures to promote competition and the freezing of prices and charges in a number of sectors. The Government is closely monitoring the impact of these measures, and recent indications are that they are working.</P>
    <P>The next budget will contain a balanced set of measures which will take account of prevailing economic conditions and which will be positive in terms of continued economic development and social progress. I will, of course, have regard to the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the context of the strategy for the budget.</P>

      <P>Any outstanding DIRT liabilities in respect of individual account holders are being met by the relevant financial institutions as a result of the look-back audit undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners. In relation to the question of &lsquo;underlying' tax on bogus non-resident accounts, that is, the question of whether the funds in the accounts have been declared for tax purposes by individual depositors, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, as they indicated in their 1999 <Col N="132" /> annual report published in July 2000, it is their intention to pursue this issue.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have informed me that their present priority is to complete the work arising from the look-back audits of the DIRT liabilities of the financial institutions. The Deputy will be aware that the commissioners are required to report to the Committee of Public Accounts before 1 November 2000 on the results of these audits. I understand that the report is being finalised at present. The issue of &ldquo;underlying&rdquo; tax will then be pursued.</P>
      <P>It will be for the Revenue Commissioners to decide on the scope of the investigation and the manner in which it is to proceed. At this stage the commissioners have indicated that, given the potential scale of the investigation, they will be considering carefully its implications as regards the use of their resources as well as any legislative aspects that may arise. They have informed me also that, while the circumstances in individual cases would have to be considered, appropriate arrangements for negotiations would be included. I understand that in due course they will also be considering the question of issuing guidelines or a statement of practice to assist tax practitioners in processing cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of the vacancies in Revenue are filled by internal promotion arrangements and any difficulties which arise in recruiting replacements at the entry grades have, with the co-operation of the Civil Service Commission, been suc<Col N="133" /> cessfully resolved to date. In the coming weeks, competitions for posts as inspector of taxes and higher tax officer in Revenue will be advertised by the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>Apart from the vacancies referred to above, I have authorised, in response to a request from the Revenue Commissioners, an increase of over 350 posts in Revenue's staffing complement in recognition of the growth in volumes of business and other requirements. The majority of the additional staff will be in the taxes grades, and details of that part of the package are awaiting the agreement of the relevant union. In the meantime, some 100 additional clerical staff have been recruited as part of the implementation of this package.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners keep their staffing levels under review and it is intended to monitor the impact of the enhanced staffing complement once it is fully in place.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the investigation into the tax compliance position of the individuals named in the report of the authorised officer on the examination of the books and documents of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, which began in October 1999, is ongoing. The investigation covers events from the 1970s onwards and, in addition to the individuals named, covers associated persons and trusts. Because of its nature, the investigation is time-consuming and detailed.</P>
      <P>To date, payments on account totalling £4.2 million approximately have been received in cases directly related to the authorised officer's report and a further £1.2 million has been received by the Revenue investigators from other persons with offshore assets.</P>
      <P>Where necessary, the various powers available are being used. For example, High Court orders for the production of information have been obtained in the case of one individual and three institutions. In addition, notices under section 900 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, have been served on 13 persons. These notices formally require the production of documents and information and are used where a person has failed to comply with informal requests. Other powers are or will be used where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The investigation will continue for some time and it is not possible to make any reliable estimate as to when it will be completed.</P>

      <Quest>the number of tax inspectors at senior or higher grade level who have left the Revenue Commissioners in each of the past three years; his views on whether this reflects a low level of morale among senior staff; the steps he is taking to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The following table sets out the number of tax inspectors at senior and higher grade level who have resigned from Revenue in each of the last three years, and this year to date. Separately the number of staff in these grades who have retired or died in this period is shown.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there have been no resignations at senior inspector level in the period in question. The resignations at higher grade inspector level amounting to seven in almost four years is a very small proportion of the 208 serving in this grade. A certain level of loss of trained taxes staff is unavoidable in view of the demand for these skills in the private sector. Loss of trained staff is a feature of life in other tax administrations, in other Departments and in business generally.</P>
      <P>Considering the low turnover rate, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the numbers leaving in this period do not reflect a low level of morale among senior staff. All those leaving have been replaced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current tight labour market, with an increased number and variety of opportunities available for those seeking employment, has undoubtedly impacted on the number of applicants for positions in the Civil Service. Notwithstanding this, I am satisfied that the vacancies situation in the civil service, while not perfect, does not represent anything approaching a crisis. The Civil Service Commission is responding to market challenges, and has eliminated past shortfalls in the supply of clerical officers to Departments. This means that the great majority of demands addressed to the commission by Departments for clerical staff will be satisfied in the very short term.</P>
      <P>At executive officer and administrative officer level, and also in certain professional-technical grades, significant additional demands for new recruits have arisen recently from Departments for which new posts have been approved. The commission has responded to these demands by accelerating the throughput of candidates from competitions already under way, and, where appropriate, holding new competitions. New open recruitment competitions at executive officer and administrative officer levels are expected to be announced within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The starting pay of the two main general service recruitment grades has recently been revised to £12,667 for clerical officers and, depending on age, between £15,536 and £17,880 for executive officers. I consider these figures reasonable, but my Department will monitor their effect on recruitment and retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also say that non-pay conditions are important to many people, and the civil service has much to offer in this area. Family-friendly initiatives such as job-sharing and career breaks, which were pioneered in Ireland by the Civil Ser<Col N="136" /> vice, continue to offer staff flexibility in terms of work scheduling and career planning. Term-time working has also been successfully piloted, and, subject to talks with the unions, a more extensive work-sharing initiative, allowing staff to opt for a wide variety of working hours and working weeks, is expected to be launched next year.</P>

      <Quest>the ethical criteria that will govern the investment of moneys in the national pension fund.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I set out the position on ethical investment of national pensions reserve fund moneys in my reply to the Second Stage debate on the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill on 11 October last.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to the debate, I looked at a number of approaches to implementing an ethical investment mandate during the drafting of the Bill. However, I concluded that the best way to deal with the issue was to proceed with a commercial investment mandate and resolve questions on ethical investment through the accountability provisions of the Bill. The Bill requires the fund commission to report annually to the Minister for Finance and provides that copies of the report be laid before the Oireachtas. It also provides for the appearance of the chairman of the commission and the manager of the fund before the Committee of Public Accounts. These procedures will ensure that information on fund investments will enter the public domain and be subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas. If an investment was not ethically or socially responsible and public pressure was brought to bear, I am sure the commissioners would take that into account.</P>
      <P>There are a number of alternative approaches which I considered in this area. One would be to lay down strict guidelines and rules to be followed by the commission. However, it would be difficult to formulate any such guidelines as the question of ethical investment is only at an early stage of development internationally. In any event, there will always be intense public debate about what is ethically acceptable and there will rarely be consensus on such matters. I am opposed to the issuance of guidelines to the commission on a more general level also. If the commissioners operated subject to guidelines laid down by either the Oireachtas or the Minister, intense scrutiny of the fund's investment strategy, particularly in quarters or years where the fund has a negative return, could due to volume of public pressure, force the commissioners into a more conservative investment strategy. I am fundamentally opposed to imposing any restrictions on the commissioners which would interfere with their capacity to make strategic decisions in the best long-term interests of the fund and thus diminish the overall return on the fund and its contribution to future pension costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other approaches which I considered include the use of the fund's voting rights to put pressure on companies to pursue ethical investments, the setting aside of a small portion of the fund's assets for investment in a separate ethical fund and screening which would exclude certain companies from indices being tracked by the fund. There are, however, drawbacks to all these approaches. The effective<Col N="140" /> ness of a voting rights approach is debatable given that the fund's holding in any one company will be relatively small. The investment of a small portion of the fund's assets in a separate ethical fund would be largely tokenism and there would be significant operational difficulties with the screening approach.</P>
    <P>Having considered these issues I concluded that the most effective and practical approach was to proceed with the commercial investment mandate and deal with ethical issues through accountability of the commission to the Oireachtas. This is the approach provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Following publication, last April, of my outline proposals for dealing with dormant accounts in financial institutions, I initiated a consultation process with various organisations on the detailed basis for the operation of such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Since then, I have considered a number of modifications to my initial proposals and these were circulated recently, by way of a draft memorandum for Government, to the relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>I expect to submit a final text of a memorandum, together with draft heads of a Bill, to Government in the near future. Subject to Government approval, the draft heads will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and I will issue a press statement outlining the proposals.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I attach a high priority to bringing forward legislation to deal with dormant accounts and I would be hopeful that a Bill can be published by end-2000 or early 2001.</P>

      <P>I am a little surprised that the Deputy feels there is a budgetary need to encourage the sales of cars given the phenomenal growth in such sales this year. The figure for net registrations to end September 2000 of new cars is 217,237 as opposed to a total of 172,456 in 1999. The Deputy will also be pleased to learn that the net registrations for used imported cars is falling &ndash; 15,244 to end September 2000 as opposed to a total of 30,550 in 1999.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on a previous occasion, following the abandonment of the ACC-TSB merger-flotation, I made it clear to all concerned in ACC Bank that the <i>status quo</i> could not continue and that it was more important than ever that the bank addresses the need for change in order to face the increasingly competitive marketplace. A change in the ownership structure is vitally important to secure the long-term interests of ACC Bank and I have asked the board to review its position with a view to bringing forward proposals for the future. The board has endorsed a strategic plan for the future development of the bank and I have received details of this. I have informed the board of ACC Bank through the chairman that it will have my full support in preparing firstly to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive market place and secondly in preparing the bank for a change in ownership.</P>
      <P>Legislation is currently being prepared which will include provisions to establish an ESOP for the staff of ACC Bank, an increase in share capital if required and also enabling provisions which will allow for the sale of the bank in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, on 20 June last, the Sub-Committee on certain Revenue matters of the Committee of Public Accounts carried out a full review of the progress made to date in relation to the recommendations contained in its report on the DIRT inquiry. The sub-committee had a further meeting on 11 July in relation to a number of specific issues and intends to revisit all issues at a special two day meeting to be held on 30 November and 1 December next. The Government is committed to implementing, where possible, the recommendations made by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the DIRT inquiry. I have ensured and will continue to ensure that work in dealing with the recommendations will be given top priority in my Department. The up-to-date position in relation to the main recommendations contained in the report for which my Department has direct responsibility are as follows.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 2000, implemented a number of recommendations made by the sub-committee in relation to the audit powers of the Revenue Commissioners, the reporting by Revenue to the Committee of Public Accounts on the results of the DIRT look-back audit currently under way and the appointment by Revenue of outside auditors. In addition, the Act provides for the enhancement of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to publish settlements. A small number of the recommendations of the report could not be implemented in the Finance Act for legal reasons. The Attorney General advised that there would be difficulties in making provision to implement a limited number of the recommendations of the sub-committee where this would involve the retrospective introduction of penalties. This advice is founded on Article 15.5 of the Constitution which prohibits retroactive penal legislation. The Attorney General also advised that there would be difficulties in introducing a provision which would affect a narrow class of taxpayer, DIRT inquiry financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> I set up a steering group following a recommendation by the sub-committee in its report, to carry out a general review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The report of the review, which was noted by Government, was submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts on 1 September and was published by it on 5 September. The sub-committee also sought submissions on the report through public advertisements in the national newspapers which were placed by my Department at its request. The sub-committee will examine the report in detail on 30 November. Following this examination and any recommendations the sub-committee may make, I will submit proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that future financial services legislation will incorporate appropriate provisions incorporating the sub-committee's proposals for ensuring that the regulatory authority for the financial services sector is formally empowered to promote high standards of corporate governance, probity and transparency in the financial services industry. In the meantime, the Central Bank itself has taken a number of initiatives in this area. It has requested all credit institutions to submit their corporate governance framework and their procedures for reporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements to their board. These are being reviewed as part of the bank's ongoing supervision. In addition, the Central Bank required all credit institutions to send it their internal codes of ethical practice and the practical implementation of these codes is now included as a routine element in its inspections and review meetings. I also understand that the Irish Bankers' Federation is close to finalising its code of ethics and practice for publication.</P>
    <P>Under the Finance Act, 1999, the Revenue Commissioners have direct access to the financial institutions by way of audit. In examining the case of such access both the Department and Revenue considered whether the UK system of an independent auditor was to be preferred. The view was taken that it was better to provide for direct access by Revenue so that Revenue could be fully satisfied that the inquiries were complete and comprehensive. Nonetheless, in the light of the Committee of Public Accounts report, provision was made in the Finance Act, 2000, to allow the Revenue Commissioners to appoint persons whom they consider to have relevant qualifications-experience to carry out audit work, but only as an adjunct to, and not an alternative to, direct access by Revenue itself. The provision is to be used at Revenue's discretion.</P>
    <P>Following the Government meeting on 11 April, I published my outline proposals for dealing with dormant accounts in financial institutions. I also initiated a consultation process with representative bodies on those proposals. These consultations have concluded and I have circulated revised proposals by way of a draft memorandum for Government to other relevant Departments. I would hope to be able to submit a final <Col N="144" /> memorandum, together with heads of a Bill to Government in the near future for consideration and decision. The scheme, as approved by Government, would then be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting of the enabling legislation. I hope the Bill can be published by end-2000 or early 2001.</P>
    <P>I will shortly submit proposals to the Government in response to the sub-committee's recommendation for the establishment of an Oireachtas commission.</P>
    <P>A draft code of conduct for civil servants has been prepared and will be submitted to Government for approval in the near future. The proposed code includes provisions which are aimed at avoiding a conflict of interest where officials accept an outside appointment or consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement from the Civil Service. Following consideration by Government the code will be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Finance and the Public Service and discussed with the Civil Service unions.</P>
    <P>The post of parliamentary legal adviser was sanctioned and an appropriate competition held by the Civil Service Commission earlier this year. The successful candidate has recently taken up duty at the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I will shortly submit proposals to the Government in response to the sub-committee's recommendation that the Houses of the Oireachtas be empowered to appoint a parliamentary inspector from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that the existing range of powers available to the Oireachtas committees is sufficient to allow the chairmen and chief executive officers to be held accountable for the strategies being pursued by their companies and the achievement of performance targets. My Department is currently finalising an updated code of practice for the governance of State bodies, in consultation with State-sponsored bodies and parent departments. The guidelines represent an updating and expansion of the guidelines issued by the Department in 1992. In contrast to the earlier guidelines, it is proposed that the new guidelines should be made mandatory. In the light of the concerns expressed by the committee, I intend, when issuing the guidelines, to indicate clearly that chairmen and chief executive officers should fully co-operate with Oireachtas committees as they carry out their inquiries and that all information sought should be made available, unless it is genuinely commercially sensitive, or involves a bona fide confidence.</P>
    <P>I will shortly ask the Government to take decisions on the sub-committee's recommendation in regard to the direction of witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>I will shortly submit my proposals to the Government for consideration in relation to the sub-committee's recommendation that the ordinary work of the Committee of Public Accounts should be under direction.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that any <Col N="145" /> such involuntary levy would offend the Consti- tution. The Attorney General has also advised that a levy cannot be introduced retrospectively. This advice is founded on Article 15.5 of the Constitution which states that &lsquo;the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission'.</P>
    <P>A small working group has been set up to undertake the comparative study. Considerable work has been done on the preparation of the base material for the study and further meetings of the working group will take place shortly. It should be noted that only one parliamentary inquiry has been established to date. The fact that there has been several tribunals and only one parliamentary inquiry may limit the validity of the conclusions to be drawn from the study.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that other recommendations made are the functional responsibility of other Ministers and some recommendation are for the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves.</P>

In addition, my Department has been consulted by the Department of the Environment and Local Government during the formulation of the draft strategy. I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, expects to publish the strategy on behalf of the Government in early November.</P>
      <P>Obviously, taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals. We already have high rates of excises on motor fuels and vehicles. I am concerned as Minister for Finance to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy, as is the Government, about the effect that the imposition of an energy tax may have on the consumer price index and how such taxes could impact on the less well off members of the community. Naturally, in all such things there is a balance to be struck in the way in which we secure our environmental goals through fiscal measures.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to cigarettes which account for in excess of 95% of all taxes generated by tobacco sales.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on sales of tobacco stamps, cigarette consumption for the first nine months of this year has increased by 0.85%, from 4.72 to 4.76 billion cigarettes, over the corresponding period in 1999. The provisional total tax take, composed of £463 million excise and an estimated £150 million VAT, has increased by 21.6% in the same period.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to isolate in the figures shown the precise effect attributable to the Budget 2000 VAT inclusive increase because overall consumption levels are dictated by factors other than retail price alone, and the yield attributable to VAT is only an estimate because VAT returns are not completed in such a manner which would enable the precise yield from specific goods to be identified.</P>

      <P>The meeting referred to is in fact the annual meetings of both the IMF and the World Bank group.</P>
      <P>The meetings provide a focal point for discussing current issues relevant to the work of these institutions and also serve, along with the spring meetings, as a means of injecting further political direction into the work of the institutions in the coming year. They also give an opportunity to assess progress since the last such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's meetings, despite being the object of street protests, in some cases violent, did register substantial progress in advancing the work of the institutions. In the case of both institutions <Col N="147" /> there was a greater willingness to engage both with civil society and with each other.</P>
    <P>The IMF covered the world economic outlook with a particular emphasis on the progress of the transition economies one decade into the process. It stressed its central role in strengthening the international financial system to assist all countries in benefiting from globalisation. It also undertook to review its conditionality, including paying due respect to members' specific circumstances and their implementation capacities. It reviewed the current financial architecture and its own role in preventing and resolving crises and welcomed the establishment of an independent evaluation office which should lead to improving its future operations and enhance its accountability.</P>
    <P>The World Bank stressed its role in the ongoing effort to reduce poverty and to harness globalisation to the benefit of all. It laid particular stress on the area of global public goods where its own comparative advantage lies, for example, in supporting actions to mitigate disease, protect the environment and encourage the sharing of knowledge relevant to development, all on a world or global scale. It also addressed the effectiveness of development and development aid through a greater co-ordination of efforts both globally and by the range of agents within individual countries.</P>
    <P>Both institutions laid particular stress on the need to accelerate debt relief, while acknowledging that this was one of a number of ingredients in the development mix. In my own contribution, I laid particular stress on the need for a faster and more flexible implementation of the debt initiative. In this context I supported the call by Canadian Finance Minister Martin for an immediate moratorium by bilateral creditors on debt payments from eligible reforming HIPC countries. I also drew attention to the need to identify and address emerging anomalies under the initiative and to ensure that the initiative is adequately financed.</P>
    <P>I also drew attention to Ireland's recent commitment to achieving the UN development aid target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. I supported the evolving role of the institutions in ensuring a poverty focus on their activities and welcomed the significant increase in the transparency of their operations for which many of us have been calling for some time. On balance I feel that these were successful meetings and that useful progress was made.</P>

To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding land), net of grants, or £7WP extended char 4,17 million for a single project, whichever is the lesser. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least 5 years by the company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period.</P>
      <P>While this relief was designed for a corporate structure, individuals can also invest through a limited partnership structure. However, in regard to such limited partnerships, in general, in the Finance Act, 2000, I had to close-off an abuse of the availability of the relief to individuals involved in a partnership structure. Closing off this abuse restricts the application of the relief to non-active partners in such partnerships. I would like to point out that in the case of such partnerships investment in renewal energy, transitional arrangements were provided for, which allow for expenditure incurred under an obligation entered into before 1 March 2001 to be excluded for this restriction. These transitional arrangements are generous. On this basis until the existing three year scheme for corporate investment has elapsed, I do not intend broadening this relief.</P>

      <P>The board of ACC Bank undertook a fundamental review of the bank, which was submitted to me in May of this year. The bank is improving its competitive position by implementing a programme of restructuring and rationalisation with the ultimate objective being to ensure a change in ownership for the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> In connection with the restructuring of the bank, I have sanctioned the negotiation of an employee share ownerhip plan and I understand that negotiations have commenced between the management and staff.</P>
    <P>The bank itself plans to move away from unprofitable lines in general retail banking which demand scale and to concentrate on business banking, which has proven more attractive for the bank. ACC also plans to change the way it does business by moving away from being primarily a manufacturer of financial products to being an adviser/consultant on and a distributor of financial products. A key element in the plan is to deliver a significant reduction in the cost:income ratio. Successful implementation of this business strategy should improve the bank's financial prospects.</P>
    <P>In 1999, ACC's underlying profits before tax and exceptional items were about £19.3 million. The bank's recent DIRT settlement of £17.9 million is expected to lead to a small net loss for the current year, but the underlying position is still profitable. On the basis of the interim results on 30 June 2000, shareholder's funds stood at IR£128.8 million. Allowing for growth in business, the capital adequacy ratio is expected to be comfortably in excess of the Central Bank's regulatory requirements.</P>
    <P>I have communicated to the board that ACC Bank has my full support in preparing to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive marketplace. I am satisfied that the underlying prospects for ACC, combined with the financial improvements from restructuring will allow it to continue to trade profitably and to prepare for a successful change in ownership. I expect to receive a business plan from the company setting out its strategy to achieve this objective early next year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I will be bringing legislation before the House which will involve an increase in the amount of share capital I can subscribe. It will also provide for an ESOP and enabling provisions in relation to the sale of the bank.</P>

      <P>The recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows a further improvement in the collection of taxes. The balance outstanding, at £1,055 million, is down from £1,167 million last year, despite a very substantial increase in the net amount of tax collected. The arrears have fallen in absolute terms, and also as a percentage of net collection. At 6% of net collection, the arrears are at their lowest level ever, and clearly show how far the system has developed since 1988, when arrears amounted to £3,500 million represented 57% of net collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This improvement has been achieved through a combined approach, removing old, ill-founded and uncollectible charges from the record, while <Col N="157" /> simultaneously improving the collection and caseworking systems to better address those liabilities which are properly due and collectible. Caseworking of individual liabilities is the main collection method employed, and has proved very effective in enabling Revenue to keep pace with a rapidly growing taxpayer base.</P>
    <P>Of the total arrears of £1,055 million, Revenue estimates that some £560 million will prove to be collectible. The difference reflects the fact that much of the older arrear has had to be estimated in the absence of declarations from taxpayers, and that some of the debt arises from business failure, where there is no means of recovering the tax.</P>

      <P>The issues raised by the road haulage sector in relation to increasing fuel prices will be considered in the context of the preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, figures collected by the Central Statistics Office on a nation-wide basis and transmitted to the Revenue Commissioners show that the price of a litre of auto diesel at the pumps rose from 52.9p in mid May 1991 to 67.2p in mid August 2000. This represents an increase of 27.0%. For the same period, the increase on all CPI items was 26.4%. Fuel prices to hauliers for bulk supply are not tracked.</P>
      <P>During the period from mid May 1997, just prior to the taking up office of the current Government, the price at the pumps rose from 56.7p to 67.2p. This represents an increase of 18.5%.</P>
      <P>With regard to VAT, the road haulage sector in general is able to recover the VAT paid on its inputs such as fuel. VAT does not, therefore, impact on the costs to the haulage industry.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, last December I temporarily withdrew ICC Bank plc from sale. At that time, I stressed that the current <i>status quo</i> was not an option and asked the board to explore all the options for the future of the bank, including a <Col N="158" /> change of ownership. In the interim, ICC submitted a strategy document for the bank which is currently being implemented. Meanwhile, the board of ICC Bank is reviewing all its options for the future of the bank and I am awaiting its proposals. I will give any such proposal my full consideration and, if I propose to accept it, I will then bring it to Government for approval. In the meantime, the ICC Bank Bill, 2000, which was published on 23 October, includes provisions allowing me to subscribe additional share capital should this be necessary. It also includes enabling provisions in relation to the sale of the bank. Under these provisions, I will bring forward a motion for approval in the Dáil in the event that I intend to dispose of my majority shareholding in the bank following such a proposal from the board of ICC Bank.</P>

      <P>The 12½% rate of corporation tax was proposed by the previous Government and introduced by the current Government in the 1998 Finance Act. The new scheme provides for the 12½% rate to be phased in so as to apply fully from 1 January 2003. Subject to a small number of exceptions, the 12½% rate will apply to trading income of companies. Non-trading income will be taxable at 25%.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place recently between senior civil servants of my Department and other relevant Departments and bodies on the possibilities that might arise for abuse of the new scheme. Following these discussions a working group, chaired by an official in my Department and containing representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IDA Ireland was set up to examine the matter. The working group is looking at various ways to prevent any such abuse of the new scheme but I am not in a position at this stage to outline them to the House.</P>
      <P>However, I assure the Deputy that, to the extent that any legislative changes might be needed, I would intend bringing forward whatever measures are appropriate to prevent abuse of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The value of the euro has fallen by around 28% against the dollar and 18% against sterling since its launch on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>The latest trade data indicate that import prices increased by roughly 9% in the seven months to July 2000 compared with the same period of 1999. Import prices are higher due to higher international prices, including the increase in international oil prices, and the weakness of the euro. These trade data include goods for final consumption as well as goods for further production and capital goods. Higher import prices for consumption goods add directly to inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, CPI, while imported goods for further production can add to inflation indirectly by pushing up production costs.</P>
      <P>However, it is difficult to separate the exchange rate effects from changes in the international prices of imports. Secondly, a large proportion of the imported goods are not consumed directly, but are rather imputs to production, and it is difficult to be precise about the proportion of overall consumption which imports constitute. Accordingly, it is not possible to accurately assess the impact of the changes in the euro exchange rate on the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>International Monetary Fund &ndash; in 1998 I recommended Mr. Peter Charleton from Central Bank of Ireland for the post of alternate director.</P>
      <P>World Bank &ndash; in 1998 I recommended Mr. Robert Carey from the Department of Finance for the post of adviser to the executive director for the constituency.</P>
      <P>Both the above appointments arise under an arrangement between the Irish and Canadian authorities. The persons concerned are chosen from within the Central Bank and the Department of Finance by those institutions. Appointments are for three years and rotate between the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Bank for Reconstruction and <Col N="160" /> Development &ndash; in June 1997 I reaffirmed the position of Mr. Tony Brown whose appointment as alternate director took effect from 1 July 1997.</P>
    <P>In May of this year I nominated Mr. Tony Brown for director on the board of EBRD.</P>
    <P>In July of this year I nominated Mr. Michael Flynn for director on the board of EBRD to replace Mr. Tony Brown.</P>
    <P>Under an arrangement with the Danish authorities, with whom we share a constituency, Ireland rotates the positions of director and alternate director on a three year cycle. Ireland became entitled to the position of director in May of this year.</P>
    <P>European Investment Bank &ndash; in May 1998 I nominated Mr. Noel O'Gorman for Ireland's director on the board of EIB.</P>
    <P>In May 1998 I nominated Dr. Michael Somers for membership of the EIB Audit Committee.</P>
    <P>In September of this year I put forward Mr. Michael Tutty as a candidate for the position of vice-president of the EIB following the withdrawal of the previous candidate.</P>
    <P>Under an arrangement within Ireland's constituency in the bank, this post is rotated between Ireland, Denmark and Greece on a four year cycle.</P>
    <P>These three appointments are of course made by the governors of the EIB.</P>
    <P>In general &ndash; I have also participated, in the course of my functions as a member of the board of governors of the above institutions, in a range of appointments where the nominations were initiated by other member states or the boards concerned.</P>
    <P>In making the appointments or nominations I considered the attributes of the persons selected in the context of the requirements of the post. I am not currently proposing any particular change in the methods of selection for the above posts.

      <P>I am aware of the comments in question. I have con<Col N="161" /> sulted the Revenue Commissioners who have indicated that they do not agree with them. I am advised by the Commissioners that senior inspectors of taxes in audit areas are normally engaged on management duties and act in a consultative capacity for auditors. Accordingly, they are not normally engaged directly in carrying out audits as such. In addition, the Commissioners have pointed out that it is essential to have an audit presence in each segment of the tax paying population and the Revenue audit programme aims to strike a balance between the audit of various risks and entities of varying size.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been some reduction over the past year or more in the number of Revenue audits, due to the reassignment of auditors to DIRT, Ansbacher and other high priority investigations. This was a factor which I took into account when, earlier this year, I approved a major staffing increase for Revenue to deal with growth in the volume of business and other requirements. This package of over 350 posts includes 166 for taxes audit and investigation work. The details of this package, which includes a number of additional appointments at senior inspector level, have been discussed in depth with the relevant Union and their agreement is awaited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community employment programme, CE, is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. CE is a very popular programme and limited resources do not make it possible to provide places for all unemployed persons. Eligibility for CE is confined to persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows/widowers pension for <Col N="162" /> a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>On the above basis persons in receipt of the carer's allowance are not eligible for CE in their own right and this payment cannot be combined with any other payment towards eligibility for the programme. However, in response to the recent recommendation of the report of the P2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities, my Department is considering the position of persons on carer's allowance with a view to accepting an appropriate period in receipt of this allowance as eligibility for CE. This would facilitate persons on low income whose caring duties have ceased to return to the workforce. I expect to be in a position to make a decision shortly.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in reply to a similar question earlier this week, I am keenly aware that the disease of HIV-AIDS is causing extreme suffering and hardship for many individuals and their dependants in Uganda. Out of an overall population of 21.2 million, approximately 1.9 million Ugandans are infected with HIV according to the Uganda Poverty Status Report 2000. AIDS has been reported as one of the leading causes of death in adults and there were an estimated 1.7 million AIDS orphans in Uganda by the end of last year. Life expectancy in Uganda has fallen from 48 to 42 in the last decade and the HIV-AIDS epidemic has been the major factor in this regard.</P>
      <P>The extent of this problem and the impact it is having on development in Uganda and throughout sub-Saharan Africa requires a substantive and coherent response from the international community and from governments of affected countries. Though now late in the epidemic, there is at this point a much greater global recognition of the extent of the disease and as a result, a substantive volume of international resources has been mobilised for HIV-AIDS prevention and containment.</P>
      <P>The Government of Uganda responded early and comprehensively to the problem of HIV-AIDS in Uganda and the President has never wasted an opportunity to highlight the extent of the problem of HIV-AIDS and the need for a systematic and sustained response. Since the early 1990s, the Government has instituted a multi-sectoral response to HIV-AIDS that has resulted in a very significant decrease in the annual incidence of the disease. Recent data would indicate that the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in Uganda has decreased from over 14% of adults in the early 1990s to approx. 9% in 1999.</P>
      <P>There is a recognition also in Uganda that HIV-AIDS will continue to present a huge challenge to poverty reduction and development for many years ahead and that attempts to control the disease will need to be sustained. Furthermore, the response of the Government of Uganda to HIV-AIDS is now being highlighted by the international community as an example to be followed by other poorer countries being faced with a similar burden of HIV-AIDS.</P>
      <P>A specific HIV-AIDS strategy was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, in January 2000, in response to the huge threat HIV-AIDS presents to the development of countries which benefit from the support of the Irish Government's bilateral aid programme (known as <i>Ireland Aid</i>). This strategy provides for the allocation of a very considerable volume of resources for HIV-AIDS activities across the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Uganda is one of Ireland Aid's six priority countries. Ireland Aid has allocated substantive financial resources in support of HIV-AIDS interventions in Uganda over the next three years, in line with its overall HIV-AIDS strategy and in response to the huge challenge of HIV-<Col N="165" /> AIDS in the country. In addition, very substantial resources have been allocated for the development of the health sector. Clearly financial resources will be directed to interventions that are demonstrated to be effective and that are situated within the framework of the Government of Uganda's National Strategic Framework for HIV-AIDS activities. This framework has been agreed between Government, international agencies and civil society organisations.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this juncture, during the week in which the President of Uganda is paying a State visit to Ireland, to congratulate President Museveni publicly on the excellent leadership he has demonstrated, within Africa, in the wake of the enormous threat posed by this disease. Our Government remains committed to working closely with his Government and civil society in Uganda in addressing this disease and will ensure that support for HIV-AIDS remains an important part of our programme of co-operation with Uganda.</P>
    <P>In addition to support for HIV-AIDS interventions undertaken by the Government and civil society in Uganda, Ireland Aid has a budget this year of £7.37 million available to Irish aid organisations, under its co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations, for development projects which meet basic needs such as primary health care. Following the Taoiseach's recent announcement at the UN Millennium Summit in New York of the Government's commitment to reach the UN development target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007, it is anticipated that funding available to Irish aid organisations under the co-financing scheme will increase from next year.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to refer to the outbreak of the virulent viral disease Ebola in the Gulu district of northern Uganda which presents a further challenge in the fight against communicable diseases. A total of 111 cases have been reported with 41 deaths. Cases were first reported in the local hospital but have since occurred in the surrounding community. The Ebola virus is highly contagious and strict containment is the only viable response in the absence of a specific treatment or vaccine. A rapid response team was dispatched by the World Health Organisation to support its local office in Uganda and to work with the Ugandan national authorities in containing the disease within the outbreak zone. Following a recent request from the Ugandan authorities, the Government has granted IR£75,000 in support of the work of the World Health Organisation in Gulu.</P>
    <P>In sum then, the Irish aid programme in Uganda is using all the means available to it, through focused Government programmes and through NGOs, to assist in the battle against HIV-AIDS and the Ebola virus and to assist in the many challenges right across the health sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The investigation by my Department into the incidents which occurred in the early hours of 10 October 2000 on the vessel MV <i>Francoise</i> en route to Brest, and which resulted in the deaths of a number of cattle being transported in cattle trucks on board, is at an advanced stage. In the meantime, the operators of the vessel have been advised that until further notice it may not carry livestock from Ireland.</P>
      <P>The investigation has involved inspection by Department personnel and others of the vessel in Brest. In addition to the reports of these inspections and related inquiries, full reports were also sought from both the operators of the vessel and the relevant French authorities, who became involved when the vessel berthed in Brest. All these reports are now to hand and are being considered in their entirety by my Department. No firm conclusions can be drawn until this process has been completed.</P>
      <P>Decisions as to whether and under what conditions this particular vessel may again be permitted to carry livestock from Ireland will be taken once my Department has reached its conclusions on the outcome to the investigation as a whole. I expect this to be within a matter of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any incident which gives rise to injury to or the death of cattle being transported from Ireland <Col N="169" /> is a cause for concern and warrants thorough investigation with a view to seeking to minimise the possibility of a recurrence of such incidents. Ireland has a good record in this area, not least because of our attention to ensuring that the proper standards are met, and I am determined that we do all in our power to see that this remains the case.</P>

A review of the statement began in April 1999 and is due to be completed by the end of the year. The safety statement charges managers with the responsibility of taking steps to ensure that staff are familiar with means of escape in the case of fire or other emergency evacuation. A new fire alarm is being installed at the Roscommon office and the Office of Public Works has been asked to examine all fire equipment and replace it if necessary.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that my staff be provided with accommodation of the highest possible standard. For this reason and following a request by my Department, the Office of Public Works has acquired a site at the Convent of Mercy, Roscommon town for the erection of new offices for my staff currently located at Circular Road.</P>

      <P>The sanctioning and delivery of specific projects is a matter for the Departments and agencies responsible for the relevant investment programmes. The Departments and authorities directly responsible for each programme area retain the responsibility for bringing forward specific projects, in co-operation with my Department which is responsible for driving the overall PPP process forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key criteria for selecting the pilot PPP projects announced in June 1999 and the further PPP projects identified under the national development plan are the project's priority at national <Col N="171" /> level and its long-term value for money. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a framework to facilitate the development of the PPP process and to guide the implementation of individual PPP projects is currently being drafted in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>However, substantial progress has already been made in implementing the PPP pilots where the focus is on design, build, finance and operate projects in the roads, public transport, education and environment areas. The purpose of the pilot phase is to help identify and resolve issues arising in relation to any aspects of the projects which may act as obstacles to the accelerated delivery of key national infrastructure and quality public services.</P>
    <P>The PPP programme is at an early stage of development. Two pilot projects in the education sector have reached the market with the pre-qualification documents for the first roads projects expected in the coming weeks. The projects have not advanced to the stage where a detailed assessment of the financing options is undertaken. Hence I am not aware of any difficulties in relation to prospective financing arrangements.</P>

    <P>As the table shows, the five items with the highest annual percentage increases are tobacco, housing, fuel and light, transport and services and related expenditure. Some of these increases are due to external factors outside of our control. For example, the increases in fuel and light and transport components largely reflect oil price increases. Similarly, the increase in the housing component partly reflects increases in interest rates by the ECB.</P>
    <P>However, domestic factors are also contribu<Col N="174" /> ting to inflationary pressures. The Government has already taken wide ranging measures to combat domestic inflation. These included measures to promote competition and the introduction of a price freeze in certain sectors. Additional resources have been provided to our Competition Authority, while the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has initiated a programme of price monitoring and publicity.</P>
    <P>The Government also last summer announced a series of measures to deal with the growth in house prices. These measures focused on reducing demand and increasing supply.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that these anti-inflation policies are having an impact. Alcohol price increases continue to slow and the education and health elements of services showed only marginal increases in September.</P>

      <P>I should explain that VAT is largely governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. It is possible to introduce reduced VAT rates only in respect of the goods and services listed in annex H of the Sixth EU VAT Directive. None of the goods and services listed in annex H refers <Col N="175" /> to either renewable or recyclable products or provide for differentiation on the basis of this criteria. A change in the annex H provisions would require a proposal from the EU Commission and unanimous agreement from the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is not possible to introduce any VAT changes which could differentiate between renewable or recycled products as opposed to competing products which are less sustainable, even should such categories be capable of precise definition. Finally, the Deputy should be aware that any changes along the lines he is suggesting would be subject to scrutiny under state aid rules by the competition directorate of the EU Commission.</P>

However, if the land in question is residential development land a special 20% tax rate applies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the current 20% CGT rate, down from 40%, for residential land, this was introduced in the 1998 Finance (No. 2) Act on foot of the first Bacon report on the housing market. This Act provided that disposals of land with planning permission for residential development would be subject to a reduced rate of CGT of 20% up until 5 April 2002 with a new 60% rate to apply for disposals from 6 April 2002 onwards. This revision of the CGT regime for residential development land was designed to incentivise the early release of land suitable for housing development. This provision was subsequently amended in the 1999 Finance Act to provide that all land zoned for residential development would be liable to a 20% CGT rate when disposed of before 5 April 2002. Later, provision was made in the Finance Act, 2000, to extend the 20% CGT rate to disposal of non-residential development land also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a higher-additional rate of tax were now introduced on any profits arising in relation to rezoned land for housing purposes, it might result in individuals deciding to 'lock' their capital in <Col N="176" /> and would have the effect of discouraging the release of land for both housing and general infrastructural purposes. The present 'carrot and stick' approach is aimed at incentivising the early release of land for residential development while providing for a penal 60% rate of CGT for disposals of such land which take place after April 2002.</P>
    <P>Additionally, under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, there is now, of course, an anti-speculative property tax in place whereby an annual charge of 2% on the market value of residential property &ndash; apart from one's principal private residence &ndash; will be chargeable in each of the years 2001, 2002 and 2003, in respect of the relevant property. Together with the graduated and differentiated system of stamp duties rates as it applies to first-time purchasers, other owner-occupiers and investors, these measures constitute a reasonable attempt to tackle speculative demand in the housing market.</P>

In the year to September 2000 these costs increased by 31.7%, contributing about 0.8% to the headline inflation rate of 6.2%. The increase of 31.7% was due to both higher house prices and the increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank from 2.5% in November 1999 to the current rate of 4.75%.</P>

      <P>The guidance notes issued by the money laundering steering committee, used by financial institutions, are in the process of being reviewed and the operation of customer identification procedures, including the issue of difficulties being experienced by particular social groups, will be examined as part of this process. I have also asked the Central Bank, which is the regulatory authority for the sector, to discuss the specific difficulties raised by the Deputy with the Irish Bankers' Federation and to communicate directly with the Deputy in this context.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, implements the EU Money Laundering Directive in Ireland. Section 32 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a financial institution &ldquo;shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service&rdquo;. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, guidance notes were issued in May 1995 by the money laundering steering committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing the various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant regulatory authorities. These guidance <Col N="181" /> notes recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes state, however, that it may be reasonable to depart from recommended verification procedures in certain circumstances, for example, when the young or the elderly may not be able to provide the documentary evidence of identity which is required of other customers. With regard specifically to young people-students, verification of identity may be obtained from other sources such as a home address of parent(s), school-college authorities or simply, as it is normal procedure for minors to be introduced to a financial institution by a family member-guardian who has an existing relationship with the institution concerned, such an introduction may be relied upon as satisfactorily establishing identity. It is a matter for an institution's management to determine the type of evidence which they are prepared to accept in such cases in order to meet their legal obligations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the basis for the Deputy's contention that many Irish citizens are of the opinion that a euro note is preferable to a euro coin, or for the view that having a one euro coin rather than a one euro note devalues the currency. Indeed I would point out that the unit of national currency in Ireland and in other EU countries is at present in the form of a coin rather than a note. It has long been decided at EU level that the lowest value euro note will be a 5 euro note and that the coin denominations will include a 1 euro coin and a 2 euro coin. Given that the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002 is less than 15 months away and that preparations for it are well advanced, I have no plans to propose that there should be a 1 euro note.</P>

In addition, since the removal of exchange controls after 31 December 1992 there have been no restrictions on the movement of capital out of Ireland and the information sought by the Deputy is, therefore, unavailable. Such expenditures, like other investments, will be reflected in the capital account of the balance of payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, it is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities, to decide on priority services for development in their functional area.</P>
      <P>The Northern area health board commenced a speech and language therapy service to St Joseph's School for Deaf Boys, Cabra, in November 1995, initially on a part-time basis, to specifically meet the needs and provide an intensive treatment programme for boys who had received cochlear implants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1998, the board increased this service to a full-time speech and language therapist post to incorporate the needs of those boys with conventional hearing aids, thus making the service more equitable. This post was filled by two speech and language therapists, both working on a part-time basis. In April 2000 one of the therapists left St. Joseph's leaving a half time post unfilled. The school has looked for this half time post to be made full-time and thus increase the speech and language therapy service to the <Col N="183" /> school. This submission is currently being considered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court Recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for paying the respite care grant in cases where a person is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance or in cases where a person is in receipt of carer's allowance only. The health boards are responsible for paying the respite care grant in cases where a person is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance only. The health board respite care grant is aligned with the criteria used by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which allows for one respite care grant per carer.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is considering the issue about paying a respite care grant in respect of each eligible person in a family in the context of the forthcoming budget. If further improvements are made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the respite care grant criteria my Department would also consider such changes, subject to Department of Finance approval.</P>

There was an overall satisfaction rating of 96/% with the service. There was no significant difference in satisfaction levels between the various locations, other than it appeared that in general there were higher satisfaction ratings in rural locations as opposed to the urban base location. There are other such general practitioner projects in operation in the North Eastern Health Board area, North East DOC and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority's area, DUBDOC, operating from St. James's Hospital. My Department will continue to support these general practitioner led co-operatives and their efficacy and operation will be considered in the review of general practice being undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards which I expect will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below. The data are derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, database which captures information on all discharges from publicly funded acute hospitals. Prior to 1995, HIPE coverage was incomplete and data are therefore not available. In addition, a public-private indicator of patient status was first introduced in 1999. For earlier years, it is possible to use information on the medical card status of patients as a proxy for a public-private indicator, but this does not take into account the extent to which non-medical card holders avail of their entitlement to public hospital care nor the extent to which medical card holders may opt for private treatment.</P>
      <P>The table presents statistics on total elective procedures for 1995 broken down for the Dublin region into medical card holders and others. For 1999, the breakdown is for public and private patients in the Dublin region. National totals for elective procedures are given for both 1995 and 1999. It should be noted that 1999 is the most recent year for which data are available. Elective procedures include surgical operations as well as daycase procedures and diagnostic investigations.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the recent trends in the number of nurses employed in the Dublin health services; and the way in which the reported shortfall of 1,200 nurses is to be made up.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23742/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A nationwide survey of nursing vacancies existing on 30 September 2000 is currently being undertaken by the Health Service Employers' Agency on behalf of my Department. When this survey has been completed, I will transmit the results to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, at this stage I can inform the Deputy that the total number of nursing vacancies in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is 1,137. This deficit is mitigated by the employment of 366 whole-time equivalent agency nurses. The impact of the shortage is further mitigated by overtime working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major Dublin acute hospitals account for 41% of the vacancies. However, the Mater Hospital has been very successful in the recruitment of nurses from the Philippines over the past 12 months, resulting in a dramatic improvement in its position. The position in St. Vincent's Hospital has also improved, following recruitment of nurses from Australia and New Zealand. Beaumont Hospital has also recently had a successful recruitment campaign in the Far East and will fill a significant number of vacancies when the new recruits commence work from the end of this month onwards. St. James's Hospital has recently recruited successfully in South Africa and anticipates that 26 nurses from there will join its staff in the near future, contributing to an improved situation. The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National <Col N="189" /> Children's Hospital, has recruited 42 nurses from Jordan and India, 21 of whom began work this week. It also has 27 nurses from Finland, Norway and Australia on its books.</P>
    <P>In addition to overseas recruitment, new graduates from the nursing diploma programmes will be coming on stream in the next few months. It is anticipated, therefore, that the overall position will have improved significantly by the end of this year.  </P>
    <P>The Deputy should also note that increasing the annual intakes of nursing students is a key element of the overall strategy for addressing the current shortage of nurses. Under an agreement between my Department and the nursing alliance, an additional 300 training places were provided this year, bringing to 1,500 the total number of training places available. The intention is that this level of intake will be maintained in 2001 and 2002.</P>
    <P>Some 1,500 new nursing students commenced training this month at various centres around the country &ndash; 1,000 in general nursing, 200 in mental handicap nursing and 300 in psychiatric nursing. This represents a 25% increase over last year's intake of 1,200 students, which in itself was the highest for several years. Record numbers of students have entered both psychiatric and mental handicap nurse training this year. Because of the high level of acceptances by successful applicants, some centres are oversubscribed.</P>
    <P>There are currently some 3,720 nursing students at various stages of training and we are on target to have 4,500 students in training by the year 2002.</P>

I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I have recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of the north east area.  </P>

      <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation which will address, <i>inter alia</i>, some consumer protection issues in relation to housing, including stage payments. I also understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs proposes to make an application to the High Court under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995, to have certain terms, including excessive stage payments, which are now being inserted into standard building contracts, deemed to be unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 149 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, published on 27 July 2000, considers in detail the merits and impact of various forms of rent control, including indexation to a factor such as the CPI. There was unanimous agreement within the commission that it would not be appropriate to recommend the introduction of a comprehensive form of rent control. The commission considered the appropriate rent to be the open market rate and recommended that rent reviews should occur no more frequently than once yearly, unless there has been a substantial improvement in the property in the interim. I intend to bring proposals to Government for implementation of the commission's report in the very near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to setting down minimum space requirements for rented accommodation, I do not think that this would be appropriate at present. Landlords currently rent units on the basis of a number of considerations, including the size of a particular unit and how many occupants it can reasonably accommodate. Obviously rented accommodation varies in quality, size and location and landlords rent and charge accordingly. Legislation is already in place to deal with overcrowding. Under section 65 of the Housing Act, 1966, local authorities are empowered to require owners to desist from causing or permitting overcrowding. If any tenant feels his or her accommodation is overcrowded, he or she should notify the relevant authority who can investigate and take whatever action is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the first-time buyers' grant, I have no proposals to increase the level of grant at present, as any increase would, in current market circumstances, be likely to be absorbed in higher prices. The question of tax relief in respect of rent paid is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I understand that a variety of issues are currently under consideration by the group including direct access to the Housing Finance Agency for funding for approved voluntary housing bodies, the terms of the voluntary housing schemes, affordable housing, the implications of Part V of the Planning Act for the sector, funding for running costs incurred by housing associations in their projects and the preparation of consolidated guidelines for the voluntary housing schemes.</P>

      <P>Planning applications are processed by planning authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Planning Acts and regulations. Under the Planning Acts, planning control is an executive function of the planning authority vested in the manager. While <Col N="197" /> this function can be delegated to senior officials of the planning authority in accordance with local government legislation, the actual making of a decision on a planning application cannot be delegated to a person who is not an official of the authority. However, there is nothing to prevent planning authorities from using private sector consultants to report on planning applications. In fact, &ldquo;Action on Housing&rdquo; published by my Department in June 2000, indicated that consideration would be given to the use of suitable private sector consultants to carry out development control on a fee per case basis. This is being pursued by my Department as part of a package of measures to increase resources in the planning system.</P>
      <P>Most planning authorities use private sector consultants for a variety of tasks including forward planning work, the preparation of the development plan and the provision of specialist advice, for example, in relation to environmental impact assessment. However, my Department has no information on the number, if any, of local authority planning departments who engage outside consultants to carry out the initial assessment of planning applications.</P>

This investment is divided between the operational programmes for the Border, midland, western region and the south east region.</P>
      <P>These new regional operational programmes have been submitted for approval to the EU. I am not aware of any difficulty in the negotiations on the operational programmes. Once these negotiations are concluded and approval to the operational programmes is received from the EU, allocations of funding will be made to local authorities as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

On receipt of this information his case will be referred to an appeals officer for early consideration. The person concerned is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the weekly rate of £123.00.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to monitoring water levels on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland, a North-South body established under the British Irish Agreement, has statutory responsibility for the management, control and maintenance of the River Shannon for navigation purposes.</P>
      <P>I understand from Waterways Ireland that while it and the ESB hold strongly that the controls operated by both parties do not impact on flood levels on the Shannon, they have agreed shortly to commission a joint study for the purpose of providing independent third party verification in the matter. The study will examine the management of water levels on the Shannon, by both Waterways Ireland and the ESB, for navigation and electricity generation purposes, and assess the impact, if any, of this operational regime on flood levels.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is being undertaken by my Department at present. It is intended that the review will be a comprehensive one, taking into account all relevant questions and situations. Submissions for proposed changes to the scheme have been invited from relevant organisations, including Victim Support, and these submissions will receive consideration as part of the review. My Department is awaiting receipt of a small number of the submissions invited before being in a position to complete the review. I hope to receive a report on the matter shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to specific proposals for changes to the existing scheme, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to make decisions in this regard in advance of receiving the report.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, while the scheme is a non-statutory one, any proposals for changes to the scheme, which may be recommended as part of the review, will require the approval of Government and the revised scheme will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As regards any arrangements for providing information to victims, I remain fully committed to providing substantial funding for Victim Support &ndash; £855,000 this year. My Department continues to maintain close liaison with Victim Support to ensure high standards of victim care.</P>

      <P>Policy in our law on guardianship is contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Status of Children Act, 1987 and the Children Act, 1997. Prior to commencement of the Act of 1997, the position was that an unmarried father could acquire guardianship rights if he subsequently married the mother or if he applied to the court under section 6A of the Act of 1964 &ndash; as inserted by the Status of Children Act, 1987 &ndash; to become a joint guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law in this area was the subject of review in the course of preparation of the Bill which led to the Act of 1997. That Bill was the subject of detailed debate in the course of its passage through the House. The Act of 1997, which came into force in January 1998, makes it possible for <Col N="201" /> a father who has not married the mother of his child to acquire joint guardianship rights by agreement with the mother of his child without having to go to court. In addition, it inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to specify that the court has discretion whether or not to order joint custody.</P>
    <P>In the course of passage of the Bill, amendments which I put forward strengthened it in the area of guardianship, custody and access with a provision that the court, in settling disputes in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals to further amend the law in this area, although I can say that its operation continues to be kept under review.  </P>

Since 1998 funding has been administered under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme.

Capital projects are sup<Col N="204" /> ported under two of the measures, viz.: capital grants for community groups and not-for-profit organisations towards the building, renovation or upgrading of community based child care facilities; capital grant scheme for self-employed providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, providing support towards the building, renovation or upgrading of childcare facilities.</P>

    <P>NB. The programme provides for drawing down of capital funding over periods of up to three years.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>On 18 October last, I announced details of further childcare funding of £26.5 million which has been allocated to my Department to invest in childcare under an anti-inflationary package.  The funding will be invested in a further range of child care initiatives including the provision of capital grants to private sector child care providers catering for more than 20 children. I intend to promote this measure in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, civil legal aid in Ireland is provided, in the main, through solicitors who are staff of the Legal Aid Board. This service is complemented by a private practitioners scheme in relation to certain cases in the District Court.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on the 17 October, the Legal Aid Board is at present considering ways in which its service might be improved, including the matter of how the additional resources that I obtained for the board earlier this year might be deployed to best advantage in terms of managing waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the 8% increase that I made available in this year's grant-in-aid allocation will be sufficient to implement any changes contemplated.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, responsibility for deciding how services should be provided is solely a matter for the Legal Aid Board.</P>

    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that the day-to-day management of the courts, including the deployment of staff, is a matter for the Courts Service and I have no function in this regard. I am informed that the current staff complement in the principal probate registry is 16. Difficulties in filling staff vacancies in the Probate Office have been experienced and have resulted in delays in the processing of applications for grants of probate. All these vacancies have now been filled. I understand from the Courts Service that every effort is now being made to reduce the waiting times for grants from their current period of eight weeks to the previous of ten to 14 days for applications made by solicitors and from 14 weeks to the previous period of five to six weeks for personal applicants.</P>

This represents an increase of 8% on the 1999 allocation.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that it is reviewing the allocation of the additional staff resources I obtained for it earlier this year. The respective needs of the different law centres will also be considered so that it can maximise the use of resources made available to it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I understand from the board that a review of practices and procedures in law centres is being undertaken to seek to improve efficiency. It considers that this review will lead to an increase in the throughput of cases and the provision of services to a greater number of persons.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications has received in excess of 40 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.</P>
      <P>Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are, in alphabetical order: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas, and Limerick. The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin south central, which will include Grafton Street and its adjoining areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city, are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The order in which the remaining priority locations will be undertaken has not yet been decided &ndash; although it is intended to commence the installation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems have been received from the following areas in south Dublin &ndash; Ballyfermot, Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire, Ranelagh and Tallaght. These applications are under consideration by the CCTV advisory committee and their recommendations will be submitted to me in due course.</P>
      <P>Recently the Garda CCTV system in Dublin north central was increased from 38 to 42 cameras. The CCTV system in Dublin south central, when complete, will result in the cameras in the original Temple Bar area being increased from nine to 24 cameras to cover Grafton Street and its adjoining areas.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to remember that Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources. As such, they must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and care<Col N="210" /> fully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges. It only applies to first time, full-time undergraduate students pursuing courses to which free fees apply.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. Similar residency requirements operate in some other EU member states.</P>
      <P>Under the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarships scheme a candidate who is not eligible for free tuition under the free fees initiative may be awarded a full or part grant in respect of lecture fees provided s/he meets all other conditions of the schemes. In order to be eligible for an award under these schemes, a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, academic attainments, means and nationality. In order to fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself must have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course.</P>
      <P>The criteria for eligibility for free fees are of general application and exceptions in individual cases cannot be made. The issue of citizenship, Irish or EU, is not a matter for my Department.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the scheme in regard to age, residency, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>I understand that the student, to whom the Deputy refers, holds a masters degree qualification and now wishes to pursue a course at PhD level.</P>
      <P>The terms of the higher education grants scheme have precluded the payment of a grant to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification. I have this issue under review at present.</P>
      <P>Separately, section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of clause 5 of the higher education grants scheme, maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from the college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college each day, having regard to the journey and available transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant. The schemes of third level student support, since 1995, provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any such grant scheme terms and conditions have, of necessity, to be introduced and it is considered that the 15 mile adjacency condition is a fair and reasonable one. Any proposal to pay all grant holders at the higher, non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant would have significant cost implications and would have to have regard to <Col N="214" /> overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under representation of disadvantaged students. This group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely initial step, pending the findings of the group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>

      <P>My Department recently issued approval to the management authority of the school to which the Deputy refers to commence architectural planning of an extension, which will include a physical education hall of 406 mf7&gt;2 of floor area. When ancillary accommodation is taken into account, the size of the facility increases to in excess of 600 mf7&gt;2.</P>
      <P>The school in question has a long-term projected enrolment of less than 450 pupils and accordingly qualifies for a physical education hall of the size mentioned above. Schools with enrolments in excess of 450 students qualify for larger facilities reflecting the additional demands presenting within such schools.</P>
      <P>The school in question is in close proximity to a further second level school. Ideally, where two or more second level schools operate in close proximity to each other, my Department would prefer that a single enlarged PE hall facility be provided to accommodate the needs of all such schools. In this way, an entire community can derive benefit from a significantly larger facility. The provision of such facilities requires agreement between all parties. Where the schools cannot reach such an agreement the standard size facilities, based on their enrolments, are provided.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): Following discussions with representatives of the health boards, the director of the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; wrote to all schools in June of this year informing them that, pending the expansion of the NEPS, it had been agreed that referrals for urgent psychological assessments of pupils in <Col N="220" /> schools which do not yet have access to its services should be directed to the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>Since the school referred to by the Deputy has not yet been assigned to a psychologist from NEPS, the school should request the relevant health board to arrange for individual assessments in respect of the persons referred to.</P>
