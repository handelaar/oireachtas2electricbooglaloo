      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Sargent. I now call on the Deputy to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to give notice of my intention to seek the adjournment of the Dáil in light of the continuing and escalating disruption to mainline and suburban rail services so that the Government can inform the House of all necessary measures it needs to initiate to ensure resolution of the dispute and to avoid further deteriorating chaos caused by ILDA actions, which Iarnród Éireann is simply calling a staff shortage, leaving its customers angry, perplexed and very frustrated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 50 &ndash; Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 52 &ndash; Town Renewal Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (<i>resumed</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m. and the sitting shall be suspended between 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.; (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 50 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise, <Col N="1346" /> Trade and Employment; and (3) the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4.30 p.m., there shall be no Order of Business within the meaning of Standing Order 26(2) and (3) and, accordingly, the following business shall be transacted in the following order: No. 52 &ndash; Town Renewal Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (<i>resumed</i>), if not previously concluded, and Remaining Stages; No. 8 &ndash; Firearms (Firearm Certificate for Non-Residents) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Remaining Stages; (4) the Second Stage (<i>resumed</i>) and Remaining Stages of No. 52, if not previously concluded, shall be taken tomorrow and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; and (5) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 8 shall be taken tomorrow and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five proposals to put to the House. Are the arrangements for today's sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 50 agreed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On item No. 50, it is proposed to take the Copyright and Related Rights Bill immediately following the Order of Business right through to 10.30 p.m. There is a proposal for a short break between 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. followed by Question Time. Because there is no Private Members' business, I seek the Ceann Comhairle's guidance as to whether, for the sake of the staff and the Minister who will be here continuously from 3.45 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., there could be a short break between approximately 7.30 p.m. and 8 p.m.? There will be only three people dealing with a very technical and difficult Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request to which I think we can agree. Perhaps the Whips could discuss the arrangements being made between 7 p.m. and 7.30 p.m.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had my way I would give everyone a break except the Minister. I would be far less sympathetic than Deputy Owen. This is the second time in a week a Minister has introduced vast changes to a Bill on Report Stage. There are seven lists of additional amendments, some of which reverse amendments the Minister tabled on Committee Stage. It is not an acceptable way to do business. This is the second major <Col N="1347" /> Bill on to which a Minister has grafted legislation on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has amended his own amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste tell the House if she still supports the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the EIB, given that in the course of his interview yesterday he indicated that a degree of <i>ad hoc</i> decision making takes place in the justice system? Our Constitution requires justice to be delivered in the open so the public can see what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will not allow a repeat of yesterday's disorder. The Deputy should ask a brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste still satisfied, having heard the questions raised in the interview given by Mr. O'Flaherty, that there is no need for her to withdraw her support from the Government? I would like a direct answer from the Tánaiste. She supported the Taoiseach yesterday despite his comments that the former judge had questions to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is before the relevant committee next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice must be delivered in public and the judge has refused to accept the findings of Mr. Justice Hamilton. Where does the Tánaiste stand on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is for questions on promised legislation. Deputy Howlin has tabled a motion for the committee and it will consider that matter next week. That is the appropriate forum for such consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no repeat of yesterday's disorder. I allowed the Deputy to ask a question, she has asked it and the matter must now be closed. Members were denied opportunities to raise matters yesterday. If there is disorder on the Order of Business, I will proceed to today's business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats Party satisfied with the replies given by the Minister for Finance yesterday when he said he was speaking on behalf of the Government in respect of the unanswered questions, including the missing bit which the Taoiseach thought should be addressed. Does the Tánaiste, or do the Progressive Democrats Party, believe Mr. O'Flaherty should accept an invitation to appear before the committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair about the relevance of questions on the Order of Business but this is highly relevant to the rest of the State.</P>
      <P>When will the following legislation, which we were promised would be taken before the end of the session and which has not yet appeared, be published &ndash; the housing (Gaeltacht) amendment Bill, the company law enforcement Bill; the national treasury management agency Bill; the standards in public office Bill; the valuations Bill; the health insurance Bill; the opticians Bill; the courts and court officers Bill and the criminal justice (fraud offences) Bill?

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <P>On a related matter, I wish to inquire about three ongoing investigations. The first, which has been in train for ten weeks, relates to the Judge Ó Buachalla affair, the second, which has been in train for 14 months, relates to the McBrearty case&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 35, after &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, Database, Performance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage and attempts to follow the practice common in other jurisdictions whereby this type of legislation is divided into different Acts. Three major Bills, namely copyright, database and performance rights legislation, are incorporated in this Bill. I stated on Committee Stage that the Bill's short title &ndash; Copyright and Related Rights Bill &ndash; does not help people to understand that the Bill covers three major issues. We are proposing that the Minister would change the title <Col N="1355" /> to read &ldquo;Copyright, Database, Performance and Related Rights Bill&rdquo; to encompass its major component parts. That would inform the public that legislation exists which covers databases and performers in addition to copyright.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the term &ldquo;related rights&rdquo; encompasses other issues such as moral and integrity rights but I contend that they are relatively minor. It does the Bill a disservice not to include the words &ldquo;database&rdquo; and &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in the short title. I am aware that these words are included in the long title but the Bill will be known as the Copyright and Related Rights Bill and we believe it would be preferable for it to be known as the Copyright, Database, Performance and Related Rights Act when it is enacted.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I have since double checked the viability of the amendment. My position has not changed. The term &ldquo;related rights&rdquo; in the current title is sufficiently descriptive of the Bill's contents which deal with copyright, performance and database rights. The term &ldquo;related rights&rdquo; also clearly stresses the relationship between the provisions in regard to performance and database rights with the relevant section in copyright. The Bill's long title makes specific reference to databases, performance and performers. The office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed amendment is unnecessary. The Deputy's concerns are more than adequately dealt with in the Bill as it is currently drafted.</P>

      <P>In page 25, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) a service which is only incidental to a business of keeping or letting premises where persons reside or sleep and is operated as part of the amenities provided exclusively or mainly for residents or inmates therein;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was also discussed previously and the Minister made some minor concessions on the issue. However, I am disappointed by his overall timidity. The extent of the ministerial <Col N="1356" /> change in section 94(2) is very mild. Section 94(2) states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Subsection (1)</i> does not apply in respect of any part of the premises to which <i>subsection (1)</i> applies where there is a discrete charge made for admission to the part of the premises where a sound recording, broadcast or cable programme is to be heard or viewed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tabled amendments Nos. 62 and 128 to this section. Amendment No. 62 will only serve to change &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; to &ldquo;special&rdquo;. I am not sure what that means. What is the difference between a special charge and a discrete charge? We discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage and it is disappointing that it has not been tidied up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

      <P>The issue of the free playing of sound recordings, broadcasts and similar facilities, such as radios and televisions, in hotel bedrooms, which were included in the 1963 Act, was omitted from the published version of the Bill. The omission raised considerable concern on Committee Stage and it was in that context that the Deputies tabled their amendments. Following representations from members of the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Irish Night Clubs Industry Association and following the constructive comments made by Deputies on Committee Stage, I changed the legislation and restored the exception outlined in the 1963 Act whereby this type of playing is permissible without the payment of royalties. I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which is now embodied in the text of section 94. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are no longer necessary and I would ask Deputy Rabbitte to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>The exception provided for in section 94 will have to be kept under review in the context of the EU Directive on copyright and the information society. I have responded to the concerns expressed on Committee Stage with a new section 94 and now propose an additional change in amendment No. 62 which seeks to substitute &ldquo;special&rdquo; for &ldquo;discrete&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Would there be anything wrong with incorporating these amendments in the Bill? It might well be a &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; approach but would that not be preferable to ensure clarity in the legislation? The vintners and the hoteliers made a very serious case in regard to their concern that the original format of the legislation would cause chaos. I have examined section 94 <Col N="1357" /> and the Minister's amendment No. 62 which proposes changing &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; to &ldquo;special&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 94(2) seems to be causing some confusion and I would be concerned that some inspectors or others would want to charge a fee for royalties in parts of a hotel or premises which the section would appear to exempt. However, in the absence of amendments Nos. 3 and 4, an argument could be made about who has the right to charge and who is obliged to pay. If the amendments will not damage the legislation but will merely clarify an issue which is quite complicated, the Minister should bite the bullet and accept one or other of our amendments, the wording of which is identical.</P>
      <P>The question of playing recorded music in various parts of hotels will become a source of argument. The Minister should accept this amendment, despite his own attempt to close the loophole in section 94.</P>

However, in this case the organisations mentioned are happy with the Bill. Section 94(1)(<i>a</i>) deals with this issue which was raised by many Deputies and Senators. I am satisfied with section 94 and I have checked the matter with the Office of the Attorney General. I will be happy to accept amendments which help to clarify matters but in this case, having consulted all the interested organisations, I am satisfied that the balance is now correct.</P>

My main concern is to deal with people's worries about the term &ldquo;dis<Col N="1358" /> crete&rdquo;. However, we all know what the import of this language will be.

      <P>In page 26, line 32, after &ldquo;applies,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other third-level institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to clarify the definition of third level institutions. The Bill defines a university as one &ldquo;to which the Universities Act, 1997, applies&rdquo; while any other educational establishment must be prescribed by the Minister under section 54. This problem would be dealt with by inserting the words &ldquo;or any other third level institution&rdquo;. Why must the Minister prescribe educational establishments under section 54? The definition of a third level establishment is more complicated than it used to be. Why must different rules apply to educational institutions? The impact of this definition on various sections of the Bill will be to make special arrangements for educational establishments. It is invidious to distinguish between them. A catch-all definition such as this would be more appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage I accepted an amendment from Opposition Deputies on the definition of an educational establishment, which is now incorporated in line 32 on page 26. Deputy Rabbitte now proposes to extend that portion of the definition to include any other third level institution. While appreciating why Deputy Rabbitte has raised this point, I draw his attention to the Committee Stage debate when I gave a commitment to consider the inclusion of technical colleges and other third level institutions not covered by the Universities Act, 1997, when the regulations are being drafted. Accordingly, this amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Again I give a commitment to Deputy Rabbitte that the question of including technical colleges and other third level institutions will be seriously considered by me when the regulations are being made.</P>

      <P>I recall the discussion on Committee Stage and I have mixed views on the matter. There is now a great variety of third level institutions. What criteria will the Minister use in prescribing third level educational establishments and on whose judgment will the designation be based? The breadth of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment might cause a problem. I could set up a college to train former judges, for example, and call it a third level institution but it might merely be a school for teaching people how to do inter<Col N="1359" /> views. What criteria will the Minister use in designating an establishment as a third level institution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear why the Minister resists this amendment. It does not propose that the legislation should apply to all educational institutions. Its application would be limited to third level institutions which imposes a requirement in terms of educational and other standards. Why must we await the Minister's prescription of the institutions to which the legislation will apply? He said in his formal reply that he will consider technical colleges for inclusion when he is making the prescription. That is different from saying they will definitely be included. Short of receiving the assurance that they will definitely be included, I have to press my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy's Rabbitte's point. It is important that such third level institutions would have guarantees that they would be included here. The thrust of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is to give them that guarantee. The Minister said that the Department of Education and Science would be included and involved, which would be vitally important. It is possibly too late to make changes to it now but if there was some form of dispute between a Department and an institution as to whether it was a third level institution, there could be grey areas involved. Deputy Rabbitte has opened up a very important question. There could be grey areas involved there.</P>
      <P>The Minister has included &ldquo;any other educational establishments prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;. It is important that everything possible be done to ensure that all the third level institutions Deputy Rabbitte has in mind are included in this. There may be third level institutions about which we do not even know. There should be some way by which these establishments could apply to be recognised and some structure set in place for this to happen, and it could happen fairly quickly. Perhaps there is some way this could be done and the Minister could give a guarantee to that effect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> In page 26, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;electronic format', where the written material is made available in a digital format, means material that can be read by a computer;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a debate on this on Committee Stage and the definition of &ldquo;electronic format&rdquo; is not given in the Bill, as far as I know. We propose to define &ldquo;electronic format&rdquo; as &ldquo;where the written material is made available in a digital format, means material that can be read by a computer;&rdquo;. It is a fairly straightforward definition. It is important that it is made clear in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I said on Committee Stage that the difficulty with this definition is that it uses technology specific terms which, although current, could cause difficulties in defining &ldquo;electronic format&rdquo; in light of unforseeable technological developments. I share the Deputy's concern on behalf of disabled people which is the reason behind the proposed amendment, as I understand it, and his concern that material should be made readily available to people with a physical handicap.</P>
      <P>To that end, I point out that section 193(11), which deals with the deposit of electronic books in libraries, together with the provisions on modified works in section 101 and section 245, will ensure that access is greatly enhanced for people with disabilities. Again, the Attorney General's office was consulted about the proposed amendment but felt there was no need to define the term &ldquo;electronic format&rdquo; for the reasons I have outlined. In the context of making changes with regard to disabled people later on, I ask the Deputy to withdraw this amendment as his concerns will be met in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Internet' means any network of computers and the technology which links them to which members of the public have access either with or without charge;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind this amendment is not dissimilar to the one advanced by Deputy Stanton with amendment No. 6, except that this is the generic term and it seeks to give some definition of the Internet. It is extraordinary that, although the Internet is referred to in the legislation, nowhere in the definition section is there an attempt at defining what that means. I do not, for the life of me, understand the Minister's arguments and why we should seek to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing that my definition or rather that of my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, who initiated it, is perfect or the only one but it does make a reasonable attempt at defining the Inter<Col N="1361" /> net as &ldquo;any network of computers and the technology which links them to which members of the public have access either with or without charge&rdquo;. That does not seem to be prejudicial in any way. If we are introducing a Bill to deal with copyright in the year 2000, to avoid defining the Internet seems to be an inexplicable omission. I ask the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to accept this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is remiss in not coming back to us on Report Stage with a definition. On Committee Stage, concerning this amendment, which was amendment No. 9 to section 2 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister gave a commitment to consider the comments made about the definition of the Internet. Modern legislation which will be enacted in the year 2000 should not ignore terms such as &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Web&rdquo;, while even dictionaries are changing all the time. All sorts of what we would have called &ldquo;makey-up&rdquo; words when we were children are now included in dictionaries because they are in common parlance. The Minister of State will find there will be many legal arguments caused by the lack of some element of definition of the Internet.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State thinks this wording is not the right one but he gave a commitment to look at this for Report Stage and I am disappointed he has not included it. I accept that the Bill has to be careful of technology which can very quickly become out of date but if a term is included, the legislation can be amended again. There are ways. The Minister has already told us that in about a year or a year and a half, to our great pleasure, somebody will be back in here debating yet more copyright legislation. Perhaps Deputy Stanton will be the Minister in charge, perhaps it will be Deputy Rabbitte or myself but one of the four people in this House may be the Minister introducing new legislation. We can manage to put in a new definition if technology has raced ahead of us in that short space of time. The Minister would be failing if he does not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Internet is a very new and all-embracing term and I can see the Minister of State's difficulty in trying to define it because it is vague, nebulous and so forth, which he said on Committee Stage. However, that probably is the reason some effort should be made to define it and to put some kind of parameter on it so it will not be so wide as to cause major confusion later on in legal circles when people start debating what is the Internet. It is the Minister's responsibility to try to put some manners on this and to put some box around it so that when people go to court and discuss it, they will have some definition on which to hang their hats. The Minister of State gave a commitment to come back to us and I await his reply with bated breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Deputy Rabbitte's definition <Col N="1362" /> is probably as good as one could get. However, I gave a commitment that I would reconsider inserting a definition of the Internet into the Bill and at that time I mentioned the AG's advice. I sought a second opinion from that office and they still feel that the definition would be inappropriate and I will explain why. The advice is unambiguous. It states that the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is in common usage and is reasonably well understood. The danger in attempting to define the word is that one may end up restricting its meaning. None of us wants to do that.</P>
      <P>I believe that the AG's advice is correct and that to restrict the meaning of the Internet would run the risk of opening a loophole whereby infringement of copyright works could occur and, moreover, if such a loophole did arise, authors would understandably be reluctant to place their works on the Internet. It would be counterproductive from the point of view of both authors and users to include a definition of the Internet as suggested. I gave a commitment that I would revisit this and I have done that. Members will agree that nobody is trying to further complicate matters in regard to the Internet because there are enough complications and litigation in that area. I outlined my advice and I ask the Deputy to accept it in good faith. Clearly, as he correctly stated, Ministers will have to come back to the House in the future to deal with this because there is an ongoing debate at EU level. I was involved in an internal market debate at a recent Council of Ministers meeting. Major and rapid development is taking place in this area. However, I have shared my advice with the Deputy and from the point of view of authors and, particularly, rights holders, it is important that more complications are not created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's argument is not persuasive. If, as he said, he undertook to get advice on whether the Internet ought to be defined in the legislation, the advice was rather skimpy. The totality of that advice seems to be that such a definition might restrict the development of what we know as the Internet and create a loophole that might provide problems in the future. That could be said about a great many things in the information age. It is not likely to be another 37 years before we renovate this law. It is more probable that the explanation is that the Minister of State's advisers say that it would be difficult to define the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and for that reason have avoided it altogether. It has already been pointed out that it is likely that the legislation will have to be revamped in a short period and this was established quite graphically in terms of the debate on the <i>droit de suite</i> issue. Why not, therefore, include a definition of the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; given its centrality in terms of communication techniques, e-commerce and so on? If in two or three years' time it is out of date we can provide for that. I am puzzled as to the reasons for avoiding this issue and I am not persuaded those outlined are adequate.</P>

      <P>The legislation is not in any way weakened by the absence of a definition of the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;. The Attorney General feels it would be inappropriate. I have no problem including a definition but I must make a call based on the legal advice available to me and the fact that there are concerns that a loophole might arise. I share the Deputy's desire for clarity but I am assured that the legislation is in no way diminished or weakened by the absence of such a definition. I accept that circumstances will change in the years ahead and, undoubtedly, amendments will be needed. There may be a need to define not just the Internet but other aspects of the high technology age in which we live and I and my successors will be open to change in this area. That is my advice and my main concern is that a loophole could arise which would create uncertainty about the position of rights holders, in particular, and authors.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 11, after &ldquo;<i>section</i>&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;38,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have come to the one of the issues which was central to our deliberations on Committee Stage. I thank the Members opposite and my three officials, who have been working day and night trying to achieve the right balance on this, for their co-operation and patience.</P>
      <P>I have a lengthy response, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I request the indulgence of the House to go through it painstakingly. We have had a lengthy discussion on this issue and changes have been made, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred on the Order of Business. I accept Members' concerns following the many amendments which were made in recent days. That was a result of many parties having conflicting positions and I kept Members informed to the best of my ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of clarity, I will later move amendments Nos. 16<i>a</i>, and 16<i>b</i>. I will also move amendments Nos. 97<i>a</i>, 97<i>c</i>, 97<i>d</i>, 97<i>e</i> and 97<i>f</i>, which are consequential on the changes proposed in amendments Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b</i>. I do not accept amendment No. 21 which represents an alternative approach to solving the same problem, to which I hope Deputy Rabbitte will agree, nor am <Col N="1364" /> I disposed to accepting amendments Nos. 1 to 3 to amendment No. 16<i>b</i> for reasons which I will outline.</P>
    <P>These amendments, especially amendment Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b</i>, represent the Government's solution to what was without doubt the most serious technical problem to emerge on Committee Stage. They concern the need to replace the section 37(4), which was introduced by Committee Stage amendment No. 21, with a measure which would allow owners of copyright and sound recording and their representatives to receive fair payment for the playing of such recordings in public and their inclusion in broadcast and cable programme services while at the same time guaranteeing fair treatment to the commercial users of these recordings. I will not repeat the extensive discussions on this issue both before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and subsequently. However, given the importance of the matter and its complexity, it is necessary to introduce these amendments in detail.</P>
    <P>Members will recall the difficulty that arose as a result of an attempt to qualify the exclusive right of owners of copyright and sound recording to control public playing of such recordings and their inclusion in broadcast and cable programme services by making it possible for users to satisfy that right through the payment of equitable remuneration. It subsequently emerged that this attempt was based on a mistaken understanding of the legal meaning of the term &ldquo;equitable remuneration&rdquo;, which, according to the Supreme Court, means a payment which is not only subsequent to the supply of the service to which it refers, but also agreed after the event. I outlined much of the legal background in the briefings which I circulated to Members.</P>
    <P>I understand the wish of users to secure fairness of treatment in their dealings with owners of the copyright and sound recording and their representatives in the context of this legislation. However, reliance on the term &ldquo;equitable remuneration&rdquo; exposes sound recording rights holders to an unacceptable level of uncertainty as to their entitlement to payment, their ability to collect reasonable payment for the public playing of sound recordings and for their inclusion in broadcasts and cable programme services. A different approach &ndash; one which would be fair to both owners of the copyright in sound recording and users of sound recordings &ndash; was clearly needed. My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of interested parties, has put a great deal of work into devising this approach which is reflected in amendments Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b</i>.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I want to thank the representatives of the owners of copyright in sound recording and of commercial users of sound recordings for their very positive input into this process. The Government is now convinced that it has devised an effective measure which will enable owners of copyright in sound recording to <Col N="1365" /> obtain the payments properly due to them in relation to these particular uses of their property while allowing due weight to the public interest in allowing sound recordings to be used in public performances, broadcasts and cable programme services without undue restriction. The approach taken is that of introducing a system of licence of right, which will in effect allow the relevant users of sound recordings to use them subject to their willingness to agree to pay, and then to continue to pay, fair payment to the copyright owners or their representatives in respect of this use.</P>
    <P>This will be more meaningful if I explain the proposal in a little detail. Amendment No. 16<i>a</i> undoes the effect of Committee Stage amendment No. 21 which related to equitable remuneration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an excellent suggestion and I thank the Deputy for making it. The new section 38(1), introduced by amendment No. 16<i>b</i>, creates a general licence as of right in favour of persons who propose to play a sound recording in public, or to include such a recording in a broadcast or cable programme service, provided that such a person agrees to make payment to a licensing body in respect of such actions, and subject to compliance with the requirements of the new section in general. The formula of &ldquo;agrees to <Col N="1366" /> make payments&rdquo; is used in section 38(1) so as to tie in with subsection (2)(<i>c</i>), which requires the payments in question to be made at intervals of not less than three months in arrears. It is logical in this context that the right should be triggered by an agreement to make payment rather than actual payment. However, the latter subsection makes it clear that continued enjoyment of the licence of right will depend on actual payments being made.</P>
      <P>The new section 38(2) establishes the principal conditions under which the right to play and to include sound recordings may be enjoyed and may continue to be enjoyed. Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) imposes a requirement that a person intending to exercise the right to play or include, as provided for in subsection (1), must give notice to each licensing body that might have an interest in receiving payments in respect of such use of sound recordings. In practice, this will be PPI Limited in respect of most sound recordings.</P>
      <P>The formulation referring to &ldquo;each licensing body&rdquo; was used to meet a concern of user interests that any regime of licence of right should include, not only collecting societies, such as PPI Limited, but any other body or individual choosing to collect public performance revenues themselves without the intervention of a collecting society. Examples would be an individual collecting on their own behalf or the private record production company of a prominent artist.</P>
      <P>Examples of both situations occur, but are rare. The &ldquo;each licensing body&rdquo; formulation, along with the definition of &ldquo;licensing body&rdquo; for the purposes of this section contained in subsection (14), will allow users to give notice of their intention to exercise the subsection (1) right to any such entity.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of human individuals within the definition of &ldquo;licensing body&rdquo; for the purposes of this section required the change to be made by amendment No. 97<i>c</i>, which will permit the Minister to exclude inappropriate requirements to submit information on applicants for registration as a licensing body, such as memoranda and articles of association or partnership agreements, where the applicant is an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is awfully clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>User interests have argued that their obligation to give notice should be restricted to licensing bodies registered under Chapter 17 of the Bill, in the interests of certainty and transparency. This argument has been carefully considered by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman. It was, however, concluded that the inclusion of such a cross-condition would introduce an undesirable inflexibility in the drafting of the Bill. Furthermore, since other amendments will make the registration of all section 38 licensing bodies &ndash; as well as section 145 licensing bodies &ndash; compulsory, and will require in the case of section 38 bodies that they indicate the rights holders whom <Col N="1367" /> they claim to represent, I suggest that these measures will allow users and potential users sufficient opportunity to be certain as to the bodies or individuals to whom they will have to give notice in order to avail of the right under subsection (1) of the new section 38.</P>
      <P>The proposed section 38(2)(<i>b</i>) introduces a requirement that an intended user inform the licensing bodies of the date on and from which he or she intends to play or include sound recordings which is not time limited. This is because the setting of a specific notice period would involve an undesirable inflexibility from the point of view of users, with no significant benefit to licensing bodies.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) secures a vital interest of both users and licensers in that it stipulates that payments should be made in arrears and at a maximum frequency of three-month intervals. There is, of course, nothing to stop collecting societies and users from agreeing to less frequent payments should this represent a suitable arrangement to both parties. However, the main point is that collecting societies can rely on three-monthly payments if that is their choice, and that liability for payment will always arise in arrears. I know that most us were very concerned about that issue.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) requires persons exercising the right to play or include sound recordings to comply with any reasonable conditions set by the licensing body in relation to payments. This is designed to meet a concern of user interests that the legislation should avoid underpinning any attempt by licensing bodies to set unreasonable conditions as to the actual use of sound recordings in public performance, broadcasts or cable programme services. Such conditions might be, for example, that particular recordings could only be played a certain number of times per night, or that certain recordings could not be played in one venue in the same evening. It may appear improbable that a licensing body would see it in its interests to set such conditions. However, user interests claim that they have experienced difficulties of this sort in the past.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>e</i>) requires users to comply with any reasonable requests for information from a licensing body. Again, it is limited to requests for information connected with the calculation and management of payments, for reasons similar to the points made about section 38(2)(<i>d</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) protects users who are in compliance with the conditions specified in subsection (2) from actions for copyright infringement at all times as if they held a specific licence granted by the owner of the copyright. Subsections (4) to (12) are standard paragraphs governing references to the controller of patents, designs and trade marks, and are not controversial. It should be noted that section 38(4) refers to a failure of a user and a licensing body to reach agreement as to fair payment. The word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; is included in the interests of highlighting the need for fairness <Col N="1368" /> in dealings between users and licensing bodies in this area, which is a matter of specific concern to user interests and, of course, to the Government.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) secures that licences of right will not be available where sound recordings are included in on-line, on-demand services, such as &ldquo;dial-a-track&rdquo; services, or Internet &ldquo;on-demand music stores&rdquo;. It is necessary to do this because article 14 of the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organisation Performances and Phonograms Treaty guarantees producers of phonograms an unqualified exclusive right in relation to the making available of sound recordings in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Subsection (14) defines &ldquo;licensing body&rdquo; for the purposes of this section. In response to the concern of user interests that any conceivable authority or entity that could own and/or exercise the copyright in sound recording should be included, the definition is broader than that applying to authors' licensing bodies under section 145. It includes any organisation having the object of negotiating licences to play sound recordings in public and even any individual who might be entitled to exercise such a right.</P>
    <P>User interests argued that it should be extended further to encompass all corporate entities that might own the copyright to sound recordings, irrespective of whether the negotiation of licences was one of its objects. Having discussed this matter with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department concluded that a change of this nature would be undesirable on policy grounds. Corporate entities wishing to perform an action, such as the negotiation of sound recording licenses, should have that object stated in their constitutions. Therefore, any corporate entity wishing to perform this function should, in any case, amend its constitution to ensure that its stated objects as a company include this activity.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, to amendment No. 16<i>b</i>, tabled by Deputy Owen and Deputy Stanton, I did not have much time to consider the exact texts of these amendments because they arrived recently, but I had some idea that amendments along these lines might be proposed on the basis of representations received from interested parties. My Department, therefore, had an opportunity to consult the Office of the Attorney General about the value of possible amendments on these lines. On the basis of the advice given to me following that consultation, I am not disposed to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2 specifically because they appear to represent &ldquo;to be sure&rdquo; measures, which we discussed earlier, designed to spell out standards of behaviour which are reasonably implicit in the text as it stands.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 might appear to have the advantage of simplicity. However, I do not intend to accept it because the current text is the result of a carefully constructed definition of a section 38 licensing body, which was developed by the parliamentary draftsman in consultation with my <Col N="1369" /> Department and which it would be unwise to disrupt. From our consultation with the draftsman, one problem I foresee with the proposed amendment is that it would soften or weaken the distinction drawn in the current text between licensing bodies, which are humans, and other entities functioning as licensing bodies, which the draftsman was anxious to establish both for formal reasons and to convey precise meaning.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, neither owners of the copyright in sound recording nor users of this material will be wholly satisfied with all aspects of this scheme. However, on the basis of consultations conducted by my Department, I am confident that they will accept that it represents a practical approach that will secure the legitimate interests of both parties. This also needs to be seen in the context of two further measures in which the Deputy is most interested.</P>
    <P>First, Report Stage Government amendments Nos. 140 and 141 propose to re-introduce the power of the controller to appoint assessors to assist him in dealing with copyright references and to time limit the delivery of awards by arbitrators appointed in such references. Combined with the measure already introduced on Committee Stage, allowing the controller power to apply to the court for the removal and replacement of arbitrators who fail to act in a reasonable time, these changes should considerably accelerate the process of dealing with references to the controller of the type envisaged by the new section 38. This should eliminate much of the uncertainty that currently afflicts both users and copyright owners and help to ensure that appropriate amounts of payment are in future determined without unreasonable delay.</P>
    <P>Second, further amendments are being introduced to place registration of all collecting societies, including those envisaged by the new section 38, on a compulsory basis. The Deputy favoured this move and I am glad we were able to achieve it. It will be necessary for collecting societies wishing to register under the new section 38 to supply the controller with the names of the rights holders whom it claims to represent and these will be placed on the public register. This should resolve concerns of users' interests as to the transparency of the collection process in this area.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I believe that we have arrived at a good resolution to this difficult problem. In arriving at that resolution, I was greatly assisted by the work of Deputies from all sides of the House in highlighting the problem in the course of the Committee Stage debate and I express my thanks, and those of the Government, for the contributions of Deputies at that Stage.</P>
    <P>This was the most difficult, controversial and technical part of the Bill. There were 11 committee meetings and much time was spent discussing sound recordings, the position of nightclub owners and hoteliers and how to bring the conflicting interests together in the context of good legislation. As the Deputies know, there has been extensive consultation with all these parties. I <Col N="1370" /> thought at the outset that it would be extremely difficult to find a solution. However, we have reached one and the Members of the House contributed to that process. I also wish to thank my officials. The three of them had to work around the clock to achieve this result. I apologise again to the Deputies for the late tabling of many amendments but that was the result of trying to bring all this technical work together. This is hugely technical material.</P>

      <P>It is the work of technical experts but we, as legislators, must bring it together and we have done our best. The Deputies were anxious to ensure compulsory registration and that has been included. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to deal with these matters at length but they are at the core of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the tremendous efforts made by the Minister of State and his officials in this area to progress the Bill. As he said, we had major reservations about the matter on Committee Stage. There was almost a row at one stage because everybody got annoyed trying to reach consensus on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's points were technical, long and detailed. As he noted, they relate to the heart of the Bill. We are not technical experts &ndash; we represent the people &ndash; and perhaps he could give a rundown of how he considers the provisions will work in practice. If people want to play music tonight or next week, what, in plain, layman's English, will they have to do? Under subsection (5), must they inform the controller every time they want to play music? Will they have to provide a list to the controller of each tape, CD or record they wish to play?</P>
      <P>This is the type of practical issue that will impinge on people. If one owns a hotel, nightclub, dance hall or disco and one wants to play tapes tonight, must one compile a list of them, submit it to the controller and tell him when one wants to start? Must the owner do this on every occasion? This matter is of concern and perhaps the Minister of State could outline the position.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions would only come into effect if there was a dispute between the owner and a licensing body. If one agreed with the licensing body, one would not have to get involved. This point relates to the core of the Bill. Will the Minister of State give a practical rundown of how the section will work? What will happen if a payment is demanded, given that amounts will be paid three months in arrears? The suggested balance could be called the &ldquo;Kitt approach&rdquo;, whereby if both sides are upset he must be winning. I will deal later with the other amendment but I would appreciate it he outlined the practicalities in this area.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Stanton, I pay tribute to the work done between Committee and Report Stages, which I have no doubt was complicated. I know the bodies were concerned about equitable remuneration and the people paying and collecting the money had strong and trenchant views on it. I commend those who have managed to ensure that only a small dispute remains to be resolved. Clarity is being sought by the hoteliers and those who will use and pay the owners for the use of music. That is why we tabled our amendments to the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the frankness of the briefing note we received on this complicated issue. It is not often a briefing note states that people got it wrong due to a heavy workload. Amendment No. 21, which was ill advised, was included on Committee Stage and caused a greater problem than the one we were trying to solve. Perhaps other Departments, when dealing with such complicated legislation, might recognise that they too can make inadvertent mistakes. This would help to ensure that good legislation is passed in the House which would not be struck out by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about subsection (5) of the Minister's amendment and that is why we tabled amendments to it. Deputy Stanton mentioned practicalities. Subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>Where the terms of a proposed agreement are referred to the Controller under <i>subsection (4)</i> a person shall not exercise a right conferred by <i>subsection (1)</i> unless he or she&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) gives notice in writing to the Controller of his or her intention to exercise the right, and of the date on which he or she proposes to begin to do so . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to make it as practical as possible. We want to include the words &ldquo;gives reasonable notice to the Controller that he or she has commenced or intends to commence the playing of sound recordings&rdquo;. We do not want a situation to develop where a person, who is playing <Col N="1372" /> music at a disco, decides at 10.03 p.m. to change the disc of Westlife to the disc of Tina Turner or Chris Rea &ndash; I do not want to mention my favourite music or I will be teased about it &ndash; and then realises he forgot to list it and has to find the controller, wake him up and invite him to the disco to sort it out. I am being slightly facetious but we must ensure this legislation works in a practical way. Otherwise, there will be a mess if disputes arise and people get angry with each other, as happened in one dispute which lasted for four or five years. I do not want discos or entertainment to be disrupted by disputes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the members of the media who are listening to this debate, although they are not in the House. They are taking this debate seriously because they know how important it is. A situation could develop where a person who has studied this legislation in detail &ndash; I am sure one or two people, apart from those of us in the House, have done so &ndash; wants to stop a concert or disco because the full information has not been given to the copyright holder. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what people need to do to ensure they keep the law when organising to play a variety of compact discs and to make digital transmissions at a concert or disco.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Stanton and Owen for their contributions and their acceptance of the fact that a great deal of work has been done behind the scenes by many people. I will accept amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 16<i>b</i> on the basis that it will provide the clarity suggested by Deputy Owen. I will also accept amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 16<i>b</i>. I accept the Deputies are seeking more clarity in these two amendments. However, I cannot accept amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 16<i>b</i>. A great deal of detailed work was carried out by the parliamentary draftsman and the phraseology in my amendment is correct. Perhaps we can make progress on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. They will have a licence of right to play and they must notify the licence body, which I presume is the PPI. The PPI will respond by talking about how much money is involved in terms of royalties. If the owner accepts, matters will proceed from there and the agreement will be put in place. However, if there is a problem because the owner of the disco thinks the payments are too high, he or she will proceed to the controller. It is important to point <Col N="1373" /> out that he or she will still be able to play music while the discussions are ongoing. It is hoped an agreement will then be reached. Arrears will have to be paid and there is a three monthly interval.</P>
      <P>A great deal of this work was carried out by my officials who met both sides and tried to reach an agreement. It was like the work of the Labour Relations Commission or an industrial relations type activity. I instructed my officials to do that in light of our discussions on Committee Stage. As legislators, we should allow them to reach an agreement if they are able to do so. It is important to bring those people on board to ensure we introduce practical legislation.</P>
      <P>We also have compulsory registration which will give better transparency. We have managed to reach this level of certainty thanks to the consultation and to all involved. I know that different parties were in touch with the Deputies. I am accepting two amendments, but not the third.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to the amendment of the Minister. The one difference in that regard is that if I am an individual, not a company, who is the owner of the copyright on a sound recording, how do I proceed? The Minister of State talked about licensing bodies being a society, a company and so on, but he does not include &ndash; perhaps it is somewhere else &ndash; the individual who is not actually a licensing body but who retains ownership of the copyright. That is possibly the difference between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different view. I agree with what has been said about the amount of work that has manifestly gone into it, and the one briefing note I got was very helpful &ndash; I agree with what Deputy Owen said about that &ndash; but I am not sure we have achieved this <i>via media</i> between the rights of users and the rights of owners, that is the timbre of the discussion so far. The pendulum has swung very definitely in the direction of the owners of copyright.</P>
      <P>I have not heard the Minister of State explain what was wrong with his amendment which he proposes to excise by way of amendment No. 16<i>a</i>. What was wrong with his amendment? He is doing a U-turn and he is excising his own work by way of amendment No. 16<i>a</i>, in other words, the essential point of what he had in was the payment of equitable remuneration.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister of State has just said he has done this because it was based on a misunderstanding of the legal meaning of equitable remuneration. That is a bit of a fantastic proposition at this stage of the day. This legislation is under preparation for a number of years. It was a long time on Committee Stage. The officials are very knowledgeable about it and I am puzzled at the simplistic proposition that it was a misunderstanding of the law. A misunderstanding of the law on whose part? Was it on the part of the parliamentary draftsman's office, the officials or the Minister of State? I find it difficult to accept that there was a misunderstanding of the legal meaning.</P>
      <P>Another reason I am not entirely disposed to accept that explanation is that the owners met with me &ndash; they obviously met with other colleagues in the House &ndash; about this matter. One normally does not deal with what transpires in these private discussions in any detail but I must say they got up my nose well and truly. When I drew their attention to the fact that this was not my amendment but the Minister of State's, they told me not to worry about that because they would straighten him out. They were visiting him after meeting with me. I have rarely met such an arrogant&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners. I have rarely met such arrogance in my time in politics. They were not just going to straighten me out, they were going to straighten out the Minister of State also <Col N="1375" /> and it would appear they have done that. They have straightened him out because what we have here is a complete U-turn from the position he had advocated up to now.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Owen said, there is nothing sacrosanct about that. I accept that any of us can make a mistake. We can be put right and we can change it, and there is a frankness about the briefing note, but this is not a mistake by the Minister of State. It is an assertion of muscle by the owners and I do not believe we have achieved the <i>via media</i> that my colleagues have more readily accepted. Maybe they are right but I do not believe we have achieved it. A lot of users will be unhappy with the position arrived at. Protection of owners of copyright seems to be the purpose of what the Minister of State has described as this core section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16<i>a</i> replaces the section to which I have referred. Amendment No. 16<i>b</i> is presumably the one that goes on to set out the new section. I had the same question as Deputy Stanton and I did not hear the Minister of State explain it in terms of how this will work practically, on the ground. Many people will have questions about that. I find it difficult to believe that the office of the controller will be able to deal with this situation.</P>
      <P>It may well be that the owners are happy to have this given expression to in law and that is enough for them. As long as they have it in law, they can choose to assert it in a few high profile cases or whatever else and maybe the office of the controller will not be bunged up, but I greatly doubt the capacity of the controller to operate this measure. Many common or garden users will not know how it is to operate on the ground, as Deputy Stanton suggested.</P>
      <P>This is a dramatic U-turn by the Minister of State on Report Stage. I am not challenging the good faith of the Minister of State, but I greatly doubt this is due to a misunderstanding about the legal meaning of the concept of equitable remuneration. This is straightforward. It is about an influential lobby group getting its way. It will be established in the years ahead that the <i>via media</i> we thought we might have secured on Committee Stage has not been brought forward by the Minister of State on this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is entitled to his view. This amendment was drafted by my officials and they have achieved the right balance in this matter. We have been most transparent in the briefing documents, which I gave a commitment to produce for the Deputies in the period between Committee Stage and this stage. The Deputies requested such briefing documents and they were prepared in terms of the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equitable remuneration was the key issue that Members wanted addressed. Equitable remuneration, compulsory registration and the resources of the controller are interlinked. Considerable representations were made by Deputies and <Col N="1376" /> Senators on the position of nightclub owners and hoteliers, etc. regarding excessive payments being imposed on them for the playing of sound recordings.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day must make decisions based on achieving the right balance and doing the right thing. The Deputy might have suspicions as to my motivations and he is entitled to have them, but I will stand over my motivation in bringing this legislation in its current form to this House.</P>
    <P>We were up-front in telling Members that when preparing the reference to equitable remuneration officials noted that a mistake was made. The former Mr. Justice Blayney in a Supreme Court judgment in the early 1990s referred to a definition of equitable remuneration. He said it means a payment which is not only subsequent to the supply of the service to which it refers but also agreed after the event. That demonstrated to me and my officials that there was an issue that needed to be addressed in the context of how&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the former Mr. Justice Blayney say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it means a payment which is not only subsequent to the supply of the service but he also referred to the fact that it was agreed after the event. Equitable remuneration was a key provision in that judgment. In a situation where parties agree payments the reference in that judgment to &ldquo;after the event&rdquo; raised a concern among my officials and legal advisers.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that intensive consultations and negotiations were made. My officials produced a new amendment, which is before us. It is appropriate that the interested parties in this case, the users and the rightsholders, or the licensing bodies involved, should be consulted. In the times in which we live and having regard to the information available under the Freedom of Information Act, there is no great secret about the fact that officials will meet interested parties. I am pleased we live in such times.</P>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I greatly regret that such language was used by those who approached him. It concerns me if people have a view that they could use their muscle to influence the Minister of the day. Such arrogance displayed by any lobby group is to be deplored and I resent greatly that type of approach. I assure the Deputy, although I do not believe he needs assurance, that I will not be swayed in any direction by the use of muscle by any group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an extensive period of consultation and reflection. We were up-front in our approach on Committee Stage. We told Deputies we would keep them informed of developments and some of that briefing material shows the process of change that took place and I commend my officials on that. I signed off on those briefing documents. I could have easily made them less transparent, but they show a change of thinking <Col N="1377" /> due to the fact that we discovered that a judgment by the former Mr. Justice Blayney was relevant. We have been up-front in our approach and have reached a resolution of this matter. I will accept two amendments tabled by Deputies Owen and Stanton.</P>
    <P>We have achieved the right balance by way of consultation and I make no apology for that. If my officials, in particular, cannot consult the parties who will be affected by this matter, it is a poor day for democracy. Equally, I stress my motivation for doing this is based on getting the right balance. I hope this copyright legislation will prove to be worthy of the House and of our discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in my chasing red herrings. I did not mention the Minister of State's motivation, good, bad or indifferent, and I do not impute any motivation to him, nor did I say that various interest groups do not have the right to make representations about their points of view. I said we have not got the right balance in this matter. I also said we have not achieved the <i>via media</i> between the conflicting rights that are at issue. That is an entirely different matter. I went on to describe my interaction with this representative group, which is a different matter, and how they told me that they would straighten out the Minister of State. What we have come up with seems to be along its line of thinking rather than the line of thinking of the users.</P>
      <P>Having clarified that, will the Minister of State outline the arguments that persuaded his officials and himself that equitable remuneration was not the appropriate approach? Does his case rely on purely the misunderstanding of the legal interpretation of equitable remuneration or is it, for example, about the difficulty in asserting entitlements to equitable remuneration? Is it the view of the Department and the Minister of State that the owners were experiencing difficulty in asserting their entitlements to equitable remuneration in all cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to explain this to us in terms of what brought the Minister of State to take this course. I refer to his briefing note on this matter, the essence of which he put on record. It states that the Department was concerned to ensure that properly structured, practical and fair legal arrangements were put in place to govern the relationship between users of sound recordings and owners of copyright in such materials as regards payment of amounts due for public playing etc. He also said that the Department concluded that compulsory licensing or licence of right approach offered the correct route to achieve this objective. Will the Minister of State explain why the Department reached that conclusion and how that will work in the practical set of circumstances raised by Deputy Stanton? What does that mean for every establishment in the country that purports to play music in the manner prescribed in this section? What exactly do they <Col N="1378" /> have to do? Who sets the level of fees and such matters? How will it operate in practice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the concerns of Deputy Rabbitte on this and we have to divert somewhat. I read the Minister's briefing note as carefully as I could and tried to understand it. I looked at the lines proposed to be deleted under amendment No. 16<i>a. </i>What was wrong with the Minister's amendment No. 21 was that it was put to us that there would be huge disputes over equitable remuneration which was something that was not agreed before playing the music. If it was not agreed before playing the music could the owners collect it? Equally the owners could play ducks and drakes with those who wanted to play it and say they did not believe that what was on offer was equitable. If they asked for £10,000 and were offered only £5,000 that would not be equitable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has managed to spell out in more detail exactly how the person who wants to play the music has to proceed but also limits the rights of the owners in preventing that person from playing the music. I was struck by the note No. 4, JRCRB4, and I read carefully what PPI Limited &ndash; the group with which the Minister discussed this matter &ndash; wanted. Paragraph 11 of the Minister's note reads, &ldquo;It is appreciated that this option [the option we are not accepting] falls short both of the preferences of PPI Limited who would prefer an unqualified exclusive right and the preferences of the user interests who would prefer the right of sound recording proprietors to be satisfied by the payment of equitable remuneration as provided for in amendment No. 21&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Stanton refers to it, the &ldquo;Kitt&rdquo; compromise is probably the best way in which to get a solution. I do not believe the owners should have a complete and exclusive right to stop somebody playing music under certain circumstances. Equally the owners of copyright have the right to expect payment and not to be hoodwinked by fly-by-nights who use the music and disappear. That is also an argument. I am trying to adopt a balanced approach to both sides in this argument because we all enjoy the benefits of people who put their money where their mouth is by putting on concerts, discos and entertainment. I would not wish to see them thwarted but at the same time there is a responsibility on them to pay legitimate amounts to those who have written and recorded the music. This will be more significant when we come to the famous <i>droit de suite </i> issue because people are entitled to some economic benefit for their artistic endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has accepted the two amendments tabled by Deputy Stanton and myself. I am prepared to accept the Minister's definition. Like Deputy Rabbitte, I am also somewhat surprised given the gestation of this legislation, that there could have been a misunderstanding of Justice Blayney's decision made in 1995 where he explained what &ldquo;equitable remuneration&rdquo; meant. It is difficult to understand <Col N="1379" /> why there might have been a misinterpretation. There was a rather quaint line in one of the other briefing documents about the Attorney General's office. I have a vision of Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rutledge <i>et al</i> in the Attorney General's Office &ndash; knowing the Attorney General as we all know and love him. It reads, &ldquo;Following correspondence and discussions that Office [meaning that of the Attorney General] now feels able to take a broader view of the situation and has revised its advice&rdquo;. There is a sense of them saying, &ldquo;Oh, holy God, we have got something terribly wrong here and we can now revise our advice&rdquo;. It is an interesting formulation of words. I wonder how long it took to devise that particular formula of words without making the Attorney General's office look as if it got it wrong, shall we say, that it now feels able to take a broader view. It is a masterful group of words to say, &ldquo;we got it wrong, thanks for explaining it to us. We are only the Attorney General's office and we got it wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fair dues to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for reaching, through correspondence and discussions, the point where the Attorney General's office now feels able to do something. It is a nice formula of words that I will return to in other debates and discussions when the Taoiseach stands up to argue that this is the Attorney General's advice. I will ask him to go back and have some correspondence and discussions with the Attorney General and he might feel able to take a broader view on the issue. It is a wonderful debating line. I would be pleased to give a copy of it to other Deputies if they need it for a debate.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat unusual for a Minister in a matter of four or five months to change an amendment which he had introduced. This seems to be that kind of legislation. It is like a rolling stone gathering moss as it goes, shedding other moss and eventually reaching the point where hopefully it is a reasonably shiny surface on which no flak or unpleasant materials will stick by way of judgments in the courts, etc. I am satisfied that between our arguments and the Minister listening to them and the two sides, the users <i>versus</i> the copyrighters, it is not a bad agreement that has been reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. In regard to the term &ldquo;broader view&rdquo; perhaps we should seek to establish copyright on that language because it is unique. The point is made. It was related to compulsory registration. The strong view of the committee was that we should pursue that. I did that on everybody's behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to Judge Blayney's judgment, the best I can say is that I accept it was unfortunate that we discovered this late in the day. The briefing document shows the trail of events leading to the unearthing of that position. These things happen in drafting legislation. There is the ques<Col N="1380" /> tion of resources which we will have to look at with regard to our staff. As a former Minister of State in this Department, Deputy Rabbitte would know that whereas the intellectual property unit staff has increased, the problem is that other officials deal with design legislation and patent legislation. Both patent and design legislation will be coming through the House shortly. It is a busy area.</P>
    <P>We started out with the exclusive right and moved on to the term &ldquo;equitable remuneration&rdquo;. The judgment of Judge Blayney was unearthed and we simply had to deal with it. With regard to how it will pan out, I explained to Deputy Stanton that fees will have to be paid to the licensing body by the hoteliers, etc. If they accept those fees, that will be the end of the matter and everybody will be happy. However, if they reject them the controller will become involved.</P>
    <P>As I told Deputy Rabbitte earlier in response to his comments about resources, we have improved the controller's position in that decisions can be made with greater speed. He can use the services of assessors and arbitrators. That will help ensure speed in this area, which was one of the complaints that arose.</P>
    <P>The other important point is that there is now a licence of right. This means the nightclub owner or hotelier can continue to play music while the dispute is being resolved. That was an important point for users, that they would not be prevented from playing music. For every improvement for the rights owners there is an equal improvement for users. It has been difficult to do that.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of Ministers at EU level, there was a debate about future copyright legislation in the information age. It was remarkable that some countries such as France held an extremely pro-rights holder position; it was a far stronger position than ours. In other countries such as the UK, the user was more important. One could draw a line between those countries which have a user bias and those with a rights holder bias. In the context of EU developments, successive Irish Governments have tried to get the balance right between rights holders and users and this provision brings into focus the debate about where to strike the balance.</P>
    <P>We have gone through changes in the Bill that ranged from exclusive rights to equitable remuneration to what is contained in this detailed amendment. I thank the Deputies for their contributions and assistance in bringing it together. I accept it will be necessary to monitor the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the controller and to ensure the resources and the new powers given to the controller will result in disputes being dealt with speedily.</P>
    <P>I believe the balance is right in this provision.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister address the sentence I drew to his attention? It concluded that compulsory licensing or the licence of right approach offered the correct route to achieving <Col N="1381" /> the objective. To be able to avail of a licence of right, one must have the licence in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers to the point I made a moment ago. There was concern that people who run discos and nightclubs could be prevented from playing music by the licensing bodies. Now there is the new term &ldquo;licence of right&rdquo; which is a counter proposal in favour of users to ensure they are not prevented from playing music by those who represent the music industry. The licence of right will allow the people who run nightclubs and discos to continue to play music. That is the meaning of the term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference between that and the problem we had with &ldquo;after the event&rdquo; in the definition of equitable remuneration? I do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to ensure those who provide entertainment would not be impeded from doing so. That is dealt with by the licence of right. With regard to &ldquo;after the event&rdquo;, that relates to the position of the licensing bodies. The problem there was that their negotiating position was effectively being removed. This relates to the point made earlier about where the balance lies. On the one hand, we are trying to protect users with the licence of right but clearly the Blayney decision and the interpretation of equitable remuneration would put the owners and rights holders in a difficult position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their negotiating rights.</P>
      <P>The provisions are complex but they are clearly pitched to ensure those who are playing music can continue to do so. Equally, given the Blayney judgment, we have inserted a new provision here. Equitable remuneration was not sufficient with regard to protecting the owners rights. That is the balance we have achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the nub of the argument, leaving aside whatever misunderstanding there was about Mr. Justice Blayney's definition, that owners felt they could not reasonably assert their entitlements under equitable remuneration? Is that the net point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Deputy has been involved in negotiations on behalf of trade unions over the years. In any negotiating position it is preferable that both sides enter negotiations from a basis of equality. The point is that there was a danger of uncertainty with regard to equitable remuneration and the position, in that case, of rights owners. Clearly, that had to be rectified and it has been rectified with this new provision. The approach has been to ensure there is a sense of <Col N="1382" /> fairness and equity with regard to the negotiating rights of both parties.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we were conscious of the excessive demands being made on owners of nightclubs and hotels with regard to payments. I was anxious to deal with that. There was a danger that they could have been prevented from playing music and we have dealt with that in a balanced way. The interpretation of Judge Blayney's decision was that it would lead to uncertainty and the term equitable remuneration would not, in my view, be fair to the owners. There would be an imbalance with regard to the negotiating position of both parties in such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are now calling &ldquo;licence of right&rdquo; ensures that the show can go on, as it were. However, how do we know that excessive demands will still not be extracted? The nightclub operator in Killarney might have a good three or four months of high summer but if demands are asserted in respect of the remainder of the year and the dispute ultimately goes to the controller, what is the capacity of the controller system to deal with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes back to how this will pan out. First, where there is a dispute, the disco or nightclub owner would pay what he or she considered reasonable. Second, I refer the Deputy to section 16(b)(4) which refers to fair payment. It provides that where the person intending to play a sound recording in public or to include sound recordings in a broadcast or a cable programme service and the licence body fails to reach agreement as to fair payment under subsection (2) within a reasonable time, &ldquo;the terms of the proposed agreement shall be referred to the controller&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a lengthy section. The process is clear. We allow for those providing music to continue to play it. If there is a dispute the nightclub owner can pay what he or she believes is reasonable and then the process begins. At the end of the day the controller will make a judgment on what is a fair payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a question to the Minister which relates to circumstances where the licensing organisation would decide to put on a big push as a result of this legislation being enacted in trying to mop up whatever is out there in terms of establishments throughout the country and so on. Where there is resistance to that and where these establishments say that unfair demands are being asserted, and that is ultimately disputed, what can the Minister say to the House at this stage about the capacity of the system to respond to that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that disco owners and nightclub owners will not be obliged to pay fees under the legislation. If they are unhappy with the provision, there is a procedure whereby they can appeal to the controller <Col N="1383" /> to pay what they feel is reasonable and allow the controller to make a judgment. There is also the question of registration and transparency in relation to the type of licensing bodies involved. In my view the process arrived at will ensure that a fair system is in place. I will monitor closely the situation but it is important that the law which is put in place allows for fair treatment for those who provide this service. I accept it is important that position is protected. In my view the law which is being put in place will do that and I assure the Deputy I will monitor the activities of licensing bodies in this whole area.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 13, after &ldquo;including a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;photograph or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to address an omission of the rights of photographers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rights afforded to others under the legislation. I sought to do this by way of inclusion in the interpretation section, specifically in the definition of &ldquo;literary work&rdquo;. At the moment &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; is defined as meaning any work, including a computer program, but does not include a dramatic or musical work or an original database, which is written, spoken or sung. Including a photograph at that stage would confer the necessary rights on photographers.</P>
      <P>I thought there was an informal understanding that we would look at this exclusion. Photographers have the same rights as any other category of journalist and it is not clear to them or to me that they have the same protection under the legislation. We are functioning in a digital age where it is very easy to distort the image of photographers, thereby diminishing their rights in terms of copyright. There was a celebrated case recently of a book entitled <i>Thanks a Million Big Fella</i> where the photograph presented on the cover intended to convey the impression to the public that it was an especially prominent photograph which is in the minds of most informed members of the public. However, it was a distortion or blending of two different photographs. The photographer in question, Eamon Farrell, took an action which was resolved in his favour.</P>
      <P>I would have thought it prudent in the legislation to include photographers. I would like to put on the record of the House a paragraph from a letter I received from one photographer in this regard. It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that you must really reflect on the digital revolution and try to imagine the future. There is every prospect that pictures will become valuable commodities to be traded across vast world-wide databases in the future, to be viewed at will on mobile phones, palmtops and through technologies not yet <Col N="1384" /> invented. Consider the fact that monopolists such as Bill Gates have for several years now been acquiring as many photographs (and paintings) as possible to build up monopolist databases of some of the world's most important images. I realise that this appears a very abstract argument but think again about the common good and ask yourself if it is a good thing that the use (and abuse) of copyright work is taken totally away from their authors and placed into the hands of near monopolies.</P>
    <P>I believe that if newspapers want outright and total ownership of the intellectual and artistic output of their staff for unfettered world-wide use they should say so up front to their journalists and negotiate this through their house agreements with the appropriate trade union.</P>
    <P>It seems a reasonable argument that there could be a number of different ways where the rights of photographers could be protected in the Bill. My amendment suggests that it should be included in the definition section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitt's amendment. It is unfortunate that photographers as a group came rather late to the legislation. Obviously they were busy with their own work and we had reached the end of Committee Stage before photographers contacted our side of the House with any great gusto. I also received the letter from which Deputy Rabbitte quoted. They are now making a case about their rights in relation to copyright and they have been very graphic about the way in which photography has changed over the years. Given the way in which photographs can be digitally transmitted, one no longer obtains the old standard roll of photographs to take to the local chemist or photographic shop to be developed. Photographers who have attended functions at which I was present have shown me on their digital camera all the shots they have taken and I asked them not to show me a particular one. They show the pictures on a small screen and it is possible to use the best one. Photography has changed dramatically from the days of the Box Brownie and the enormous amount of apparatus required for developing. My husband was a photographer and his developing equipment is probably antique by now.</P>
      <P>We want the Minister to recognise that photography involves artistic skill to the same extent as books, plays or films. We owe it to those who earn their living as photographers, and to those who enjoy it as a pastime, to recognise the artistic merit of their work. Deputy Rabbitte has found an ingenious way to do that by including it in the definition of literary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of photography was raised on Committee Stage and, subsequently, the Minister received representations from photographers about their right to the copyright of material <Col N="1385" /> photographed on film provided by their employers. They also want their work to be recognised and protected from distortion because their names often appear with the photographs they have taken.</P>
    <P>I was subject to distortion myself in an edition of <i>Phoenix</i> when I was a Minister. Rather flatteringly, they took a picture of Pamela Anderson in the film &ldquo;Barbed Wire&rdquo; and put my head on to this scantily clad, curvaceous body and I appeared in the magazine in that way. Obviously, everyone knew it was not my body so it was clear I was not being defamed but someone who did not know me might have wondered why I posed in this semi-clad manner for <i>Phoenix</i>. I hasten to add that I did not do it. I saw for myself, however, how photographs can be digitally altered and the join cannot be seen. That can be damaging to professional photographers who produce good work and do not want to see it distorted.</P>
    <P>There will be arguments about photography in other sections but this would be an ingenious way to ensure that it is well protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about two separate issues. Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to include photographs under literary work. Photographs are allowed protection as artistic works and are clearly included in the earlier definition of artistic works in section 2. If we include them in both definitions, it may lead to confusion and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. Their inclusion under artistic work deals with the desire expressed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The separate issue of photographers in the print media was raised but amendments dealing with that subject have not been tabled, although there is one related to journalists. We sent the Deputy some briefing material about photography in general.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Owen's experience with <i>Phoenix</i>, there are provisions in the legislation under moral rights to protect photographers whose photographs are distorted.</P>
      <P>The rights of photographers are contained in section 21 of the Bill, which includes them in the interpretation of &ldquo;an author&rdquo;. In this Bill, an author is the person who creates a work and that includes photographers. Clearly, there are specific protections for photographers as holders of artistic rights.</P>
      <P>The position of newspaper photographers is the same as that for journalists. We tried to strike the right balance between employees in the print media and the owners of newspapers. Photographers working in the print media will be granted an equal right of use of such works for purposes other than inclusion in newspapers or magazines, including on-line versions of those newspapers and magazines. These are the same provisions as for journalists but amendments have not been tabled to deal with employee photographers. We have debated journalists and newspapers at length and we have tried to strike the right balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> We have included photographs in the definition of artistic works and that is the most appropriate way to deal with the issue. It is unnecessary to have a second reference to photographs in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not notice its inclusion under artistic work. Is there a difference between its inclusion in artistic work and literary work? Will any entitlements be conferred as a result of its being included under literary work instead of artistic work? </P>
      <P>The Minister raised a separate point about the equation of photographers with journalists. He says they are included in the definition of journalists. If that is so, we still have a problem because the freelance issue, which was unresolved on Committee Stage, will be as complex for photographers as it is for journalists. A good picture taken by a photographer in a particular set of circumstances is likely to be in demand with agencies across the globe. Where that photographer is not an employee of a particular print medium outlet but is instead a freelance operative, he or she will be curtailed by the legislation in terms of what he or she may wish to do. However, we will deal with that issue in respect of a later amendment.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State in a position to reassure me that entitlements will not be affected and that differences will not arise as a result of inclusion of the word &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; in one section as opposed to another?</P>

      <P>In page 27, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oireachtas copyright' shall be construed in accordance with section 188(2);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I will reserve my position until I hear what the Minister of State has to say. We debated this matter on Committee Stage and I do not know why he appears to have changed the position which originally obtained in respect of Oireachtas copyright. The amendment seeks to ensure that Oireachtas copyright shall be construed in accordance with section 188(2) because the Minister of State appears to have done a U-turn in respect of this matter. I accept, however, that he may have good reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 188(2) states that &ldquo;The copyright in a work to which this section applies shall be known and in this Act referred to as &ldquo;Oireachtas copyright&rdquo;, notwithstanding that the copyright may <Col N="1387" /> be, or may have been, assigned to another person.&rdquo;. It appears that a bureaucratic requirement is being put in place that, provided it is approved by the Civil Service, a work may be assigned Oireachtas copyright and that the system which obtained on Committee Stage has been changed.</P>

      <P>In the interests of clarity I wish to state that I will be moving amendments Nos. 103<i>a</i>, 105<i>a</i>, 105<i>b</i>, 105<i>c</i>, 105<i>d</i> and 106<i>a </i>and I will not be accepting any other amendments in this group.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Members expressed concern that the current text of the Bill relating to Oireachtas copyright is obscure and that it could create practical difficulties in the management of Oireachtas copyright. In response to those concerns I directed my Department to consult the Office of the Attorney General in this matter. The critical final outcome of these consultations is embodied in amendment No. 105<i>d</i>, which sets out an effective way in which Oireachtas copyright can be managed. My other amendments are, in effect, consequential on that change.</P>
      <P>I know Deputies share the view that Oireachtas copyright is a delicate matter and most, if not all, Members of both Houses would be in favour of giving people the widest general permission to copy parliamentary materials in the civil and public interest. I had originally intended to propose an amendment which would amount to an effective waiver of the right of the Oireachtas to restrict free copying except in the event of a motion being passed by both Houses. However, I was advised that this approach could be regarded as inconsistent with the dignity of the Houses because it would represent an excessive restriction on the ability of the Houses of the Oireachtas to manage an aspect of their affairs. Most Deputies recognised that aspect during the Committee Stage deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that it could be an excessive restriction on the ability on the Houses of the Oireachtas to manage their affairs. We were anxious not to confer autonomy on the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of this area.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that some of the amendments put down, particularly amendments Nos. 105 and amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 105<i>d,</i> might be open to similar criticism. Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 105<i>d</i> would be open to the additional criticism that it would excessively inhibit the effective management of the copyright interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate in the Seanad and on Committee Stage I referred to the difficulty of devising a basis for the management of Oireachtas copyright which would be both effective and consistent with <Col N="1388" /> the dignity and prerogatives of the Houses. My current proposal, which was drafted with considerable care, will provide such a basis. I know it will be necessary to operate these arrangements sensitively and I trust that the Houses and their officers will do so. I also have little doubt that in most instances the cause of free availability will win out.</P>
    <P>While I am not in a position to accept the amendments from Deputies opposite, I am again in their debt for their work in committee on this issue which was of real help to my Department and the Office of the Attorney General in developing the necessary new approach embodied in my amendment. I thank Members for their attention in this matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate why amendment No. 105<i>a</i> proposes the excision from section 188 of the term &ldquo;other than a Bill&rdquo;? What is the purpose of changing section 188(3) which, as it stands, states: &ldquo;Oireachtas copyright in a work other than a Bill shall expire 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was made.&rdquo;? The Minister of State did not deal with that point. If members of the public want to gain access to a Bill in the normal way and they observe the rules the House has laid down, why should they not be able to do so? Why is it necessary to delete the term &ldquo;other than a Bill&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>It is important that the public interest should be served in respect of Oireachtas copyright and that interested members of the public, researchers and others should be able to gain reasonable access to instruments and documents produced by the House. That should include access to Bills because, even after a Bill is enacted, the document itself is extant and it may be no less interesting in view of the differences between the originally published version of the Bill and the version which is ultimately enacted.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is aware that our main concern is that Acts and Bills of the Oireachtas and other such material should be made more freely available to the public. The only argument he has put forward against this seems to involve preserving the dignity of the House. We must balance preserving that dignity against the rights of members of the public to have freer access to the Bills, Acts and other documents which affect their lives directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone some way towards allaying our concerns. However, a bureaucratic provision is being introduced under which a citizen of the State will be in breach of the copyright law if he or she photocopies a Bill or an Act without permission from the Oireachtas. The Minister is not allowing the type of freedom we would like to see extended to the citizens of the State, rather he is restricting their freedom through the imposition of a layer of bureaucracy. Which is more important, the dignity of the House or the freedom and right of citizens to gain access to <Col N="1389" /> material which has the effect of imposing all manner of restrictions on how they run their lives? I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and to accept the amendments which have been tabled as being more in line with 21st century thinking.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter previously and the Minister undertook to seek legal advice on Oireachtas copyright with a view to drafting more appropriate amendments. Perhaps the Office of the Attorney General has provided advice to the Minister. I accept that the Minister has tried to take on board the essence of our previous discussion on this issue but, without any disrespect to either him or his advisers, I would have thought that the Opposition amendments were more simple, straightforward and understandable in regard to meeting our objectives. We may not have had all the fancy legal language but I believe that amendment No. 104, for example, which states that &ldquo;it shall not be an infringement of copyright to copy an enactment&rdquo; is absolutely straightforward and unequivocal.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 105<i>d</i> in the Minister's name seeks the deletion of lines 13 to 29 in page 108 and the substitution of: &ldquo;189.&ndash;(1) Subject to <i>subsections (2) </i>and <i>(3)</i>, a permission to copy or to make available to the public any work, Act of the Oireachtas, Bill or other material protected by Oireachtas copyright under the provisions of this Chapter may be granted to any person .&rdquo;  That will make it necessary for a person who wishes to obtain such material to ascertain whether he or she fulfils the requirements of &ldquo;the conditions . imposed from time to time on such materials by the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann .&rdquo;  It would be preferable for people to have the right to obtain such material <i>ab initio</i> and for the Ceann Comhairle to mark particular Acts or Bills should he wish to do so. People would, therefore, have the right to obtain or copy material other than in very rare circumstances in which conditions might be imposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment fails to recognise that Members may also be restricted by these conditions. I would like to think that as a Member of this House, I could openly and freely access any material such as a Bill, Act, report etc. produced herein without breaching copyright. The amendment proposes the insertion of section 189(2) which states: &ldquo;The conditions upon which any work, Act of the Oireachtas, Bill or other material protected by Oireachtas copyright may be made available under this Chapter shall be those imposed from time to time by the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;  I am concerned that my rights to make copies of legislation or parts thereof might be restricted in some way. I have found it very useful in much of the legislative work we are obliged to do to pass copies of legislation on to other people to obtain their advice.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Rabbitte's query on the reasons for the proposed deletion of <Col N="1390" /> the phrase &ldquo;other than a Bill&rdquo; in amendment No. 105<i>a</i>, the amendment reflects the view that there is no valid ground to make the distinction that the copyright pertaining to a Bill should continue when the Bill lapses, is withdrawn or is signed into law by the President. It became apparent that the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;other than a Bill&rdquo; was not appropriate.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that these Houses have the right to reserve copyright where they choose to do so. We have spoken about the dignity and the autonomy of the Houses and I was attempting to reflect the views expressed on Committee Stage. One of the aspects of the Houses' power is the ability to protect their own papers. That appears to be a requirement laid down in Standing Orders and there may even be a constitutional issue here. Following from our Committee Stage discussions, I endeavoured to reflect the independence of the Houses. We have given the matter our best shot on this side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> This amendment relates to protection defeating devices. On Committee Stage we stated that greater consideration should be given to this new technical area. Exceptions are made in other jurisdictions in regard to this matter and I propose to outline some of them. The exceptions include allowing libraries to make good faith determinations on whether they wish to obtain authorised access to work. In other words, they would be able to circumvent protection defeating devices for that purpose. On encryption research, it has been brought to my attention that in some cases exceptions are made to allow circumvention of access control measures and the development of the technological means to identify the flaws in and vulnerabilities of encryption technologies.</P>
    <P>Exceptions can also be made in regard to the protection of minors, which is very important. These allow a court applying the prohibition to a component or part to consider the necessity of its incorporation in technology which prevents minors accessing material on the Internet. I am sure the Minister is aware that in some cases protection defeating devices allow personal information to be collected on the user of material. Technology exists to collect and disseminate personally identifying information about the on-line activities of a natural person. Protection defeating devices, known as applets, have the effect of taking information about a user and disseminating it <i>via </i>the Internet so that other users can access it. The technology to circumvent applets exists. There are also exemptions permitting the circumvention of access control measures.</P>
    <P>I could speak about reverse engineering and so on, but these subjects are extraordinarily technical. The amendments propose that the Bill defines protection defeating devices as including any device, function or product, or component incorporated into a device, function or product, the primary purpose of which is to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent, for infringing purposes, any rights protection measures.</P>
    <P>Another Bill will soon be necessary to bring legislation in this area up to date. Has the Minister of State given further thought to protection defeating devices and does he propose revisiting this area in the future in order to bring the law up to date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Stanton, who has a very fine understanding of applets and other devices about which I confess a great ignorance.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the terms used in legislation are operable. The section would be particularly strengthened by the addition of the words &ldquo;for infringing purposes&rdquo;, the removal of the words &ldquo;without authority&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; for &ldquo;unauthorised&rdquo; in lines 22 and 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not illegal to do something without authority. I stress the need for amendment No. 11 which would substitute the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; for <Col N="1392" />&ldquo;unauthorised&rdquo;. A rights protection measure is defined as &ldquo;a process, treatment, mechanism or system which is designed to prevent or inhibit the unauthorised exercise of any of the rights conferred by this Act&rdquo;. This definition would be strengthened by the substitution of &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; for &ldquo;unauthorised&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;unauthorised&rdquo; is not a strong one and I wonder why it was used. Our purpose is to ensure that people do not break the law.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister of State's arguments on these amendments, particularly amendment No. 11?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Owen and Stanton have raised issues which concern the precise circumstances in which the protection afforded by the Bill to technological measures designed to protect copyright should operate. The first three amendments propose changes to the definition of a protection defeating device while the fourth and fifth amendments propose a change to the definition of a rights protection measure.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept these amendments, for two related reasons. First, the current text of the definitions is correct. For example, the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;or effect&rdquo; as proposed by amendment No. 8 would leave the provisions in the Bill dealing with the protection of technological measures completely reliant on the primary purpose of the protection defeating device, potentially a difficult thing to prove by itself. On the other hand, it is hardly unreasonable for the primary effect of a device to be taken into account where this effect is unauthorised circumvention.</P>
      <P>The second reason for not accepting these amendments is that they could affect the proper relationship between copyright and related rights with the technological means that might be used to protect them. The proper approach is to regard the protection measures as mere means to an end and not to promote them to a level where technological protection becomes something of an effectual property right in itself, independent of its base in copyright. The danger of allowing this to happen is that it could result in a situation where even the most justifiable exceptions to copyright, in education or in the provision of modified works to persons with disabilities for example, could be set at nothing by the claims of an overriding technological protection right. This is the view of most of our EU partners and is a major consideration in current negotiations on the proposed EU directive on copyright and the information society.</P>
      <P>Pending the conclusion of these very difficult negotiations, we must tread carefully in relation to technological protection measures. This is a very live issue and, as of now, these amendments would not be advisable. I am aware of the importance of the issues raised by the Deputies and will bear them in mind, especially in the ongoing process of devising Ireland's position on the directive. I realise the amendments take us into an area which is developing at great speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> Since the Committee Stage I have consulted the Office of the Attorney General on these proposed amendments and it has advised that they would weaken the definitions of a protection defeating device and of a rights protection measure and thus weaken the protection intended to be given in the Bill to owners of copyright who protect their work with rights protection measures. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 28, lines 43 to 46, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 43 down to and including line 46 and substitute &ldquo;and a computer programme;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I see little change in what the Minister has brought forward apart from a more economic use of English. I see no response to the arguments put on Committee Stage. My amendment refers to the definition of &ldquo;work&rdquo; on page 28 and seeks to deal with the restricted definition of moral rights. The question of the definition of &ldquo;work&rdquo; brings me back to the amendment we have just discussed which dealt with the excision of Oireachtas copyright in a work other than a Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not sure in terms of the definition of work, that Oireachtas copyright is encompassed. The definitions of work are literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement of a published edition or an original database. I am still puzzled about amendment No. 105<i>a</i> that we put through proposing to delete the term &ldquo;other than a Bill&rdquo;. Incidentally, computer programme is spelt incorrectly. That will be picked up, no doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage relating to amendment No. 15, I explained why it was necessary to expand the definition of work to include the words which Deputy Rabbitte is now proposing to delete. The Deputies will recall the changes proposed in amendment No. 15 on Committee Stage were necessary because moral rights, that is paternity rights, integrity rights and right of false attribution which are provided for in Part II, chapter 7 of the Bill, only cover works which are literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works and films. Moral rights should not be provided for in a Bill relating to sound recordings, broadcasts, cable programmes, typographical arrangements of a published edition, original databases or computer programmes. Accordingly, these works had to be excluded from the definition of works for the purpose of moral rights. Therefore, I cannot accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which will, in <Col N="1394" /> effect, provide moral rights to companies in relation to sound recordings, broadcasts, cable programmes etc.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall on Committee Stage there was some debate as to whether the moral rights in the Bill should be extended to unnatural people or corporations such as record and film production companies. Deputies will also recall that it was the considered view that it is more appropriate to limit moral rights to human people only. Moral rights protect creativity and not investment and are rooted in the idea that an author's work is an extension of his or her personality. Where corporations are entitled to avail of moral rights, users may find it more difficult or costly to use the material even to find the right person from whom to obtain clearance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to extend moral rights to companies and I trust Deputy Rabbitte will therefore consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputies considered that the wording of the definition of a work was clumsy and difficult to understand, especially in the context of amendment No. 15. On reviewing the matter, I am happy to say that I agree with the Deputies and accordingly, I propose amendment No. 12 which makes this definition clearly.</P>

    <P>Representations have been made to me by <Col N="1395" /> interested parties, in particular, PPI, that because they are not assigned the copyright and sound recordings by their clients, they encounter great difficulties in infringement proceedings because infringement of copyright is actionable by the copyright owner only under the 1963 Copyright Act and under sections 124 and 294 of this Bill.

    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a work, other than a computer program, is made by an author in the course of employment by the proprietor of a newspaper or periodical and is made for the purpose of being lawfully made available to the public in a newspaper or periodical, the proprietor of the newspaper or periodical shall be entitled to the copyright only in so far as it relates to the lawful making available to the public of the newspaper or periodical or to its reproduction for the purpose of its law<Col N="1396" /> ful making available to the public in the newspaper or periodical and in all other respects the author shall be entitled to the copyright subject to any agreement to the contrary.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am trying to fight a battle here which was lost on Committee Stage in respect of the position of journalists, specifically freelance journalists. We clarified on Committee Stage that in the case of journalists who are employees, the first ownership of copyright was vested in the newspaper, their employer. However the position that has obtained up to now in respect of freelance journalists was that they had discharged their responsibility to their employer, the commissioning newspaper, once their article was published and so on but they were quite free to enter into a separate arrangement with a newspaper in some other part of the world in respect of the same material and receive some remuneration for it.</P>
    <P>As I understand from what the Minister has done, that position is changed and the position of freelance journalists is changed. I presume the discussion we had in respect of photographers is relevant here. Photographers would be even more likely to be in a freelance position than journalists and I cannot see the necessity to change the status quo.</P>

There is no reasonable cause to interfere with the<i> status quo</i> and the Minister has not explained why we ought to do so. The National Newspapers of Ireland has made determined representations on this point but, if anything, the world of changing technology makes it more important that journalists retain their existing rights.

      <P>I have followed the debate on this legislation with some interest and I wish to address the arguments presented by Deputy Rabbitte<i> vis-à-vis</i> his amendment. I support the case he put. I want to reflect on one area which he touched on in his contribution, the concerns of the Press Photographers Association of Ireland about section 23, which is regarded as a significant departure from the current situation and a diminution of the rights of journalists, including photo journalists, to retain copyright on their work. By losing copyright in the way proposed, photographers would also lose the right to <Col N="1397" /> stop the digital distortion of their photographic images.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter. There is grave concern about the implications of this section. The PPAI has pointed out that rights which many photographers and other journalists may not have realised they had are being taken away. This has serious implications for the potential of workers in the media to earn a living. Although this is a late intervention, it is the only appropriate opportunity open to me to contribute. I join with Deputy Rabbitte and other speakers in urging the Minister of State at this late stage to take on board the real concerns of print and photo journalists, on whom I lay particular emphasis. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment and the range of arguments offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The PPAI expressed concern about digital distortion and this needs attention because such distortion of photographic records is a serious matter. However, I am not sure it is appropriate to address that in this Bill. The most important and significant point is that a high proportion of print journalists are freelance and they retain copyright on their work. The legislation recognises a balance between the rights of those who produce creative work and those of their employers. However, I add a word of caution. The amendment could lead to a field day for clever lawyers. I do not think there is a floodgate argument whereby free speech will be stopped.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify that a journalist will remain free to make commentary on the expertise he or she assumes in the pursuit of his or her journalistic activities. I am not a big fan of the NNI but the balanced argument it has put forward on the issue of maintaining copyright in the manner which the Minister of State proposed originally is acceptable. We do not go as far in that direction as, for example, the British and journalistic freedoms are protected in a general sense, but the rights of the employer are recognised in regard to something which is written by an employee.</P>
      <P>Digital manipulation of images should be addressed but I am not sure this is the appropriate legislation in which to do so. However, it will undoubtedly be a major issue for those of us in public life in the years ahead.</P>

It would substantially restore the situation in the Copyright Act, 1963, whereby employee journalists in the print media would retain copyright on their work, except for the purpose of its inclusion in a newspaper. Deputy Rabbitte is correct that this wording appeared in an earlier draft. I especially thank Senators Coghlan and Ryan and Deputy Rabbitte and others who have been involved in the debate thus far. I have carefully considered the matter both prior to and since Committee Stage. I remained convinced of two points, first, that the old exception which favoured print journalists over all other classes of employee was anomalous, unjustifiable and could not be continued and second that at the same time, some degree of recognition for the long-established rights of employee journalists should be maintained, in all justice. Accordingly, the present text of section&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wanted to try to ensure that we had this long-established right of employee journalists maintained. Accordingly the present text of section 23(2), which would assign copyright to the employer &ndash; that is, the newspaper proprietor &ndash; in such cases, while giving the employee journalist a limited right of use of the material outside the newspaper's sphere, is a reasonable and honourable compromise between the competing interests on this point. I do not wish to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>In effect, it is a compromise between the 1963 position and the position in the United Kingdom, which as Deputies know, takes all the rights away from the employee journalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the case of the freelance journalist remains the same. To return to what Deputy Roche said, the journalist can <Col N="1399" /> obviously become involved in any other area of journalism or can produce any other work, apart from publication of the newspaper. So, there is a separation between his or her work with the newspaper and other works in which he or she might be involved. I look forward to coming back to this matter at a later stage.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that Irish sheep farmers are getting full market value for lambs at present; the reasons French farmers are getting almost 35p per pound more for their product; the steps Bord Bia is taking in France to overcome blatant renationalisation of the sheep market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The marketing of Irish lamb is primarily the responsibility of the industry. The returns to producers ultimately depend on the extent to which the product can compete on our main markets, and in particular on the French market which is by far our largest outlet. The initiatives of Bord Bia to promote Irish product underpin the marketing efforts by Irish companies. I have no reason to believe that Irish producers are not receiving the appropriate prices, given current returns being obtained from the market, but I am firmly of the view that the existing price differential on the French market can be progressively reduced over the coming years to the benefit of the entire industry.</P>
      <P>Among the factors related to our ability to compete with French domestic production are price, quality and the range of assurances which can be provided to the purchaser and, ultimately, to the final consumer. While prices available to domestic French lamb producers have traditionally been higher than for imported product due to transport costs and a preference on the part of the French consumer for native lamb, this has been exacerbated in recent times by the renationalisation of the market and the development of locally based quality assurance schemes, including the introduction of identification and traceability systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts of Bord Bia in the French market this year have concentrated on promoting Irish lamb using the positive image of the product identified in its research. The initiative is concen<Col N="1400" /> trated in mid-summer, at a time when Irish supplies are at their most plentiful. The promotion involves clearly identifying Irish lamb as a high quality product and marking retail packs with a &ldquo;Lamb from Ireland&rdquo; label. Participating companies must supply lamb according to certain specifications. There is recent evidence that the promotion initiative has contributed to arresting the seasonal decline in prices to Irish producers which had been taking place since early May. The general trend of prices this year has been relatively satisfactory compared to some recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I hope he did not misunderstand me when I asked if producers are getting a return based on current market prices because I am referring to the Irish meat factories. Their actions over the past three or four weeks have been disgraceful. They are in a position to pay at least another 5p or 6p per pound to lamb producers. Will the Minister comment on that aspect? If he accepts the point, what can be done about the factories in terms of advance prices and a record of prices around the world?</P>
      <P>Regarding the French market, the Minister of State went to the trouble of accompanying the agriculture group recently to Rungis market. What is happening in France with regard to Irish lamb is a disgrace. The quality of Irish lamb was as good as anything the French had on the day we visited, but there is still a difference of 30p per pound. In my view, Bord Bia's intentions are sincere, but it lacks the financial resources to get across the message to the 60 million French potential consumers that Irish lamb is as good as any other produce. There is a breakdown at that level and I ask the Minister of State to comment on the matter.</P>

      <P>Bord Bia has made positive moves with regard to the promotion of Irish lamb in Paris and France. The Deputy was present when we visited the market to see what was happening there. Ireland is an exporter and our dis<Col N="1401" /> tance from the market has an effect in terms of freshness of the product. French lamb is on site in its own area. It is tender and fresh and compares more favourably than Irish lamb.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia undertook a special promotion this year on an experimental basis, which took place just before we visited the market. The purpose of this was to improve the promotion of Irish lamb to consumers and to help in every way possible. The outcome of that promotion is not yet known but the indications are that it was successful.</P>
      <P>Regarding Irish, English and French lamb at the market, I agree with the Deputy that there was little or no difference in the lamb from the three countries. We saw lamb at the various stands, but their people look after the domestic operation and they pay those prices. They are more loyal to their produce. Ireland exports lamb which is surplus to requirements here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the arrangements for the distribution of the additional milk allocated to Ireland under Agenda 2000. Ireland received 32 million gallons of additional milk quota under the agreement. Of this, 20.5 million gallons is available in the 2000-01 milk year and the remainder, that is, 11.5 million gallons, in the 2001-02 milk year.</P>
      <P>The role of the milk quota review group is an advisory one and I took its recommendations into consideration in deciding on the allocation of this quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 were set out in my reply to parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999. A total of 15 million gallons has already been allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. The co-operatives have been <Col N="1402" /> notified of the allocation to each successful applicant.</P>
    <P>A further five million gallons is being allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment and to date we have received approximately 3,500 applications. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect. The completed application forms have been received through the co-operatives and are being examined by my Department to establish eligibility and to calculate the quantity of additional milk to be allocated to each eligible applicant.</P>
    <P>My Department will endeavour to have the individual allocations made as early as possible and all applicants will be notified of the outcome of their applications. The additional quota allocated will be available to producers for use within the quota year beginning on 1 April this year. I will announce details in due course for the allocation of the remaining 500,000 gallons that has been set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution. No decision has been made regarding the distribution of quota becoming available under Agenda 2000 during the next milk year.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister take the advice of the milk quota review group, which comprises members of ICOS, ICMSA, IFA, Teagasc and Macra na Feirme, to give restructured quota as a priority to those engaged in temporary leasing and to those with non-renewable leases? Did the milk quota review group not put forward a case for farmers who have shown their commitment to farming by purchasing restructuring quota from the restructuring scheme in recent years and who are now being denied priority access to such quota? Did the Minister accept the recommendation of the milk quota review group which forgot to include an important group of young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The milk quota review group is made up of the main farming organisations. It has been there for some years and it advises the Minister of the day on the allocation of milk quotas. I took its recommendations into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have published the rules for the sale of quota from this year's quota restructuring scheme. In establishing the priority categories under that scheme, it was important to take account of the situation which exists in the current year, which is a transitional one, from one quota regime to another. For that reason, 85% of the available pool is being set aside for those producers who have been dependent on temporary leasing in recent years and for producers who held quota under land leases which, for reasons beyond their control, they cannot renew. It is clear that these are the two categories of producers whose needs are greatest and who would, in the absence of priority access to quota, be the most vulnerable. In setting the priority categories, I took full account of the advice of the milk quota review <Col N="1403" /> group. It is my view that the arrangements which have been put in place for this transitional year are best suited to meet the specific requirements of the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are young farmers who purchased 50% of their quota in the past four years from the restructuring scheme being discriminated against at a time when there are not any tax concessions to enable them to purchase it? What is the position of young farmers who applied for milk restructuring in 1999 and were given so many thousand gallons but when their herds got brucellosis they were advised not to use it but to reapply this year? Will they be thrown to the wolves now that the rules have changed? How did the farming organisations forget to make a recommendation on their behalf? I am baffled by what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of farmers who purchased milk quota similar to those alluded to by the Deputy demonstrates their interest in active milk production. They acquired quota under restructuring and that was additional permanent quota which was made available to them. People depending on temporary leasing were seen to be vulnerable. If they had 15,000 or 20,000 gallons of milk under temporary leasing and that was cut off, they would have no option but to sell it.</P>

      <P>When the announcement was made about the five million gallons of additional milk quota, did the Minister say it was likely that young farmers would get a maximum of 5,000 gallons? From the figures the Minister has given to the House, it looks like young farmers will not get much more than 1,500 gallons, which is the same as they would be likely to get from a lucky bag. It will be almost useless to them. Why were they not notified about this at the beginning of the milk year on 1 April, as they should have been? Is it true there is a new rule in the Department that new entrants to farming will not get a quota from this allocation this year? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to milk quota is fairly straightforward. There are approximately 31,000 milk producers in the country. Ireland received 32 million gallons and 15 million gallons have already been allocated. There was in excess of 21,000 applications for the 15 million gallons. It is relatively easy to divide it into the overall amount available. We can only give out what we have available. As regards the five million gallons, the Department received in excess of 5,000 applications. Approximately 3,000 to 3,500 of these will be eligible. It is easy to divide that figure into five million gallons to find out what is available.</P>

In prioritising the categories to give active milk producers and those committed to milk production as much as is available, the milk quota regulations, apart from the additional milk, are being changed and modified. We want to ensure that committed active milk producers get a fair crack of the whip and get access to quota in so far as is possible.</P>

      <P>Where reactors are disclosed, herdowners are advised immediately, <i>inter alia</i>, of the restrictions on disposing of milk from reactor animals, that they should never consume unpasteurised milk and the other precautions they should take to protect public and animal health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placing on the market of raw milk for direct human consumption in that condition is forbidden. It is not unlawful, however, for milk producers to use it in their own households. My Department does not have figures for the number <Col N="1406" /> of households where unpasteurised milk is consumed but it is estimated that such consumption is quite low.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate in broad terms the expenditure to date on brucellosis eradication, which I assume is fairly high? Is he satisfied that a large number of herds remain infected? Also, since there is a huge cost in terms of medication, health care and quality of life for those infected with brucellosis, will the Minister agree there should be a more pro-active campaign to inform people of the risks associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information on the costs the Deputy has requested but I am sure I can procure them for her. Neither do I have the figure on the people who consume unpasteurised milk. A number of farmers produce their own milk but do not have their own pasteurising facilities and it is possible and probable that those families consume unpasteurised milk at farm level. A leaflet which offers advice to herdowners when brucellosis enters their herds is freely available; I am sure the Deputy has the leaflet.</P>
      <P>This year has seen an improvement in overall levels of brucellosis. Last year there were 458 reactor herds but that figure has reduced to 337. That is a fairly substantial improvement, despite what has been said. The trend is downwards and with good discipline at farm level and control of movement, I am convinced we will bring it down to a manageable level. The country was practically free of brucellosis a number of years ago. I recognise that the cost to the taxpayer and to the farmers, and the nuisance involved, is very high but I do not have the actual figure.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider liaising with the Department of Health and Children for a more pro-active campaign to dispense with the folklore that unpasteurised milk is somehow better for the consumer than pasteurised milk? There should be an active campaign to inform consumers of the critical risks associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk.</P>

      <P>The part of the Deputy's question relevant to the Department of Health and Children was sent to the Department because it is the regulatory authority in that area. I agree with the Deputy that it is important to liaise with the Department of Health and Children to highlight the dangers of unpasteurised milk and the difficulties it can cause for families. I do not have the figure on that but I believe it is at farm level only.</P>

      <P>Clawback of quota does not currently apply under any of these mechanisms. However, I have made provision in the regulations for the introduction of such a measure if I deem it necessary in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 I have made provision for a scheme of farm waste management. A significant level of funding amounting to some £181 million has been allocated for this measure.</P>
      <P>The measure will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western regions and the southern and eastern regions. Clearance to proceed requires the approval of the European Commission. The broad clearance procedure is already well under way, as negotiations with the EU on the community support framework for Ireland necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds have been recently completed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the relevant operational programme required has recently been finalised and submitted to the Commission within a tight timeframe. The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow and there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. The procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail. As it is likely to continue over a number of months, it is not possible to indicate at this stage when this proposed scheme will commence. The Deputy can be assured that I will do all I can to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Does the Minister agree it is outrageous that in the month of June he still does not have any idea when these grants will come into place? Given that protecting the environment is part and parcel of an important duty of care we have been given, it is outrageous that farmers, who are doing their best to prevent pollution of rivers etc. will have to wait almost 12 months for the payment of such grants. Given that some farmers have borrowed money to upgrade their farms, will the Minister agree to backdate grants when they are eventually settled, as he is forcing farmers to pollute the countryside or to be up to their tonsils in debt with their banks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We operate as a member of the European Union. That has considerable benefits for Irish agriculture but it also has some drawbacks, one being the amount of bureaucracy involved and the time spent getting approval for various schemes and programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This farm waste management scheme, for which funding of £181 million has been allocated, <Col N="1410" /> is worthwhile. Even though the European Commission indicated it will process the scheme with all speed, from past experience, having regard to clarifications and various other requirements sought, we realise it will take six to seven months to get EU approval for it.</P>
    <P>To be helpful to the farming community, I approved a national scheme, the control of farm pollution scheme. That is in operation and farmers are availing of it to fill that gap until such time as the farm waste management scheme comes into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the problems with such schemes is that no preparatory action appears to be taken prior to the ending of existing schemes? In other words, if a scheme expired on 31 December 1999, will the Minister agree that the time to set in train the process of negotiating a new scheme should be 1 July 1999 and not 1 January 2000, given that the European Commission takes six months to reply to the Minister's request for approval for such a scheme, it is in recess in July and August and farmers have to wait until September or October for the approval of such schemes and the subsequent payment of such grants?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions Nos. 29 and 44 are similar to this question. This issue is one of the most serious affecting farmers. If a farmer participating in REPS has problems regarding farmyard pollution and a case is brought to court, such a farmer will be liable automatically to a possible clawback of £25,000. If such a farmer does not meet the criteria set for this scheme, he could be liable to a clawback in respect of other elements. The urgency of the need to introduce this scheme cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept that the programme of schemes for this country was submitted to Brussels too late and that is the source of this problem. Other European countries have got approval for their programmes. There is a delay in approving this farmyard pollution scheme, REPS, EU grants and other schemes.

It was subsequently discovered that the butter had been diverted to the Polish market in breach of the conditions of sale. The matter was the subject of an investigation by a mission from the European Commission in 1992. Following consideration of the report of the investigation by the EU Commission, the Commission indicated that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should apply a forfeiture of three million ecu from the security being held as a penalty for the non-performance of the conditions of <Col N="1412" /> sale.

Our experience with the EU and its Court of Auditors and auditing system is that it is overly supervisory. From time to time I get a great deal of criticism about EU payments, inspections, audits and so on. There are two or three inspections and there are spot checks. There is a tremendous degree of accountability there, which is right and proper, but at the same time one wants to run schemes smoothly and so far as farmers are concerned, one does not want to over penalise or over inspect them.

      <P>The Minister will be aware of research conducted by Peter Humphreys, Eileen Drew and Candy Murphy aimed at developing better gender equality to counter the challenge of persistent inequality ascertained in the research. Will he agree that it showed minimal progress towards a balance of men and women in grades above HEO level in the past decade? It indicates that more work needs to be done to support people to combine work and family responsibilities. Is the Department setting clear targets based on its strategy statement to increase the level of participation to ensure the number of women at assistant principal level, which rose by only 1% in the decade 1987-97, will increase substantially in the next decade?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the figures show that a tremendous amount of progress has yet to be made. For example out of 84 at principal officer level, only 16 are women. I would like if the number could be more balanced. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development intends to comply fully with the new gender equality policy for the Civil Service. Targets have been set to have at least one-third of posts at assistant principal level filled by females within five years. It is hoped to make better progress than that. There will be positive action such as a programme of affirmative recruitment, placement and training to ensure an adequate and appropriate gender balance in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and throughout the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Last year was an excellent year for live exports. This year looks set to be even better. In the period from 1 January to 31 May 1999, more than 160,000 cattle were exported, compared with just over 53,000 in the same period in 1998 and 19,000 in the same period in 1997. I am pleased to be able to say that the figures this year look set to surpass even those for 1999. From 1 January 2000 to 31 May 2000, almost 218,000 live cattle have been exported. More than 180,000 of these were exported to high value EU markets and the remainder to the Lebanon.</P>
      <P>There has been another positive development in recent weeks, with the culmination of lengthy, and sometimes difficult negotiations in relation to the re-opening of the Libyan market. In this regard, I spent a week in Tripoli last August, meeting the Libyan authorities on the specifics of a resumption in trade.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also raised the matter with Colonel Gadaffi in Cairo in April, and my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by a number of senior officials from my Department, reached a final agreement with the Libyan authorities on Friday, 9 June. Once the Libyan authorities open tenders and include Ireland as a potential supplier, it will be open to Irish exporters to bid for contracts under this process.</P>

      <P>Farmers and the trade generally deserve the best credit for the vibrancy of the live trade. From 1996 it was difficult due to the BSE problem which we have, even though it is only minimal, and we have only sporadic incidences. Nonetheless it is not easy to maintain our high animal health status and our farmers in the industry deserve tremendous credit for that. In relation to Libya specifically, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterpart in Libya to the effect that in future contracts, Ireland would be able to tender. The precise wording of it was, &ldquo;The import of live cattle and beef will be according to Libyan standards which accord with the accepted OIE international standards&rdquo;. It was agreed that Ireland will forthwith be officially listed as a source country for all tenders opened by Libya for the supply of live cattle. In practice that means that&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if he has concerns at the increasing level of butterfat now evident in Irish milk, and the subsequent super levy penalties which are being incurred; the measures he proposes to deal with this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the provisions for the imposition of a super levy on the volume of excess milk deliveries, the relevant EU regulations also include measures to restrict increases in the fat content of milk deliveries. Penalties are imposed when the butterfat content of milk deliveries during a milk quota year exceeds the national butterfat representative level. Each producer has a butterfat representative level, which is based on the fat content of his or her milk deliveries during either the 1984-85 or 1985-86 milk quota years, whichever is higher. At the end of each milk quota year, milk deliveries of each individual producer are adjusted to take account of the difference between the actual fat content of the producer's milk deliveries and his-her butterfat representative level. The actual milk deliveries are adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.18% for each 0.1 grams/kg difference between actual fat and butterfat representative level.</P>
      <P>Each year every co-operative-dairy submits details of the aggregated total of their producers' actual deliveries and fat adjusted deliveries. On the basis of these figures, the overall totals at national level are calculated by my Department and, in accordance with the relevant provisions in the EU regulations, super levy liability is calculated on the higher of the two quantities, that is, actual or fat adjusted milk deliveries, provided that this quantity exceeds the national quota.</P>
      <P>In the 1997-98 milk quota year, the fat adjusted milk deliveries exceeded the actual deliveries as well as exceeding the national quota. The super levy liability was, therefore, established on the basis of the fat adjusted deliveries. The same situation will apply for the 1999-2000 quota year. For the 1998-99 quota year, even though the fat adjusted figures exceeded the volume figures, no super levy applied as the national quota was not exceeded.</P>
      <P>In most member states of the EU where super levy has been incurred over recent years, the levy has been established on the basis of butter fat adjusted figures. Over the past decade the trend in Ireland in relation to increases in butterfat levels is consistent with the general trend in other member states.</P>
      <P>A decision to take measures to increase or reduce butter fat levels is essentially one for producers themselves. Such a decision would obviously take account of all commercial factors involved.</P>

      <P>Has the Department any idea of the monetary loss farmers have sustained as a <Col N="1418" /> result of EU regulations and the increase in butterfat over the last decade? What penalties have been imposed on individual farmers or is there a method of ascertaining that? What education campaign has been conducted by Teagasc and the relevant State agencies to ensure that farmers are aware of the impact of this new regulation? It applies throughout Europe. What efforts are being made to influence management practices at producer level to ensure producers do not suffer a penalty which they need not suffer if they apply the appropriate management practices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When milk quotas were introduced, our average fat content level was 2.9%. Through better nutrition, breeding and management the level is now at an average of 3.58%. There is a substantial change. I am anxious to encourage less emphasis on fat and more emphasis on protein. That would not impact as badly on producers.</P>
      <P>During the Agenda 2000 negotiations, efforts were made to change the butterfat criterion but the proposal fell on deaf ears. Research is being carried out into measures to increase the protein content of milk without increasing its butter content. Reducing butter content should be encouraged by the industry. Greater protein content is the way forward rather than taking total solids into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister revisit this matter at European level? Our index butterfat levels in 1982 were well below those of our European counterparts. Some countries have over 4% butterfat content at present. Due to breeding and nutrition our cows are now producing a higher content level. There must be a strong case for revisiting this issue. Ireland got short changed on butterfat. We are talking about a curtailment of quota due to the way the butterfat levels have increased.</P>

      <P>A new area based compensatory allowance scheme is to be introduced with effect from 2001 as part of the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations and, in particular, to protect the future of these payments in the context of WTO.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate proposals for a new scheme and to ensure an orderly transition. The task force met on a number of occasions and, having considered a range of options, the group recommended a scheme which would involve a payment per hectare linked to the type of livestock on the holding. The proposals envisaged a one hectare payment for each livestock unit.</P>
      <P>I announced details of the proposed scheme, including an increase in the overall headage grant limit from £4,000 to £5,000, on 29 May last. I also announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments for the period 2001-06. The allocation for sheep headage would almost double to £40 million annually.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with officials of my Department, the European Commission was not satisfied with aspects of the scheme being proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The fact that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment was seen as continuing the link to production.</P>
      <P>The task now is to devise a scheme which is best suited to our requirements and which meets Commission approval. Earlier this week, I raised the issue with Commissioner Fischler and had direct consultations with him on the matter when I attended the EU Farm Council meeting in Luxembourg. My officials are in continuing contact with the Commission with a view to devising an alternative proposal. Further consultation is also taking place with the farming bodies with a view to formulating such a scheme.</P>

There are many mixed and hill sheep farmers in the west and I hope the proposal which has been increased to £5,000 can be increased further to £6,000 or £7,000. Sheep farmers have had a few bad years and have not received much sympathy. Therefore, I hope when the Minister returns to Europe he will try to achieve an increase in the figure of £5,000.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply, we are trying to get the best possible deal for farmers in disadvantaged areas because they are the people who most need support. That is why I indicated a doubling of the headage payments for sheep farmers in particular who have gone through a difficult time. Unfortunately, the scheme we devised with the farming representatives was regarded as linked to production. We argued strongly that we should at least have a transitionary period of five or six years from headage to area based payments. If one goes directly to area based payments, a person with a small holding would be penalised severely and there would be huge distortions between what farmers received last year and what they will receive next year. Following my meeting earlier in the week with Commissioner Fischler &ndash; my officials are in daily contact with the Commission &ndash; I hope there will be a satisfactory resolution to the matter in the next two weeks.</P>

The ICSA made this proposal some time ago and it was laughed out of court. I want to put that on the record as some of the farming organisations may have short memories, even though I have not.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the Commission wants payments in the less favoured areas decoupled from production to make them WTO compatible? Can I be so bold as to suggest that if the French put forward a scheme they will proceed with it. France proceeds with the national interest because renationalisation is taking place there and in other countries throughout Europe. We are too compliant with the EU. It is important that we hammer out this aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year sheepmeat prices in Ireland have been on average 20% above last year's levels, although they have fallen significantly in recent weeks. The fall in prices is due largely to increased competition on the French market arising in particular from an increase in supplies from the UK, New Zealand and Spain. The renationalisation of the French market is also a factor. Prices reported during the past week have indicated that the decline in prices has been arrested.</P>
      <P>My Department has raised the issue of New Zealand lamb imports with the European Commission in recent weeks and the Commission has undertaken to remind the New Zealand authorities of their obligations to avoid disturbing the EU market. I also had discussions with the lamb processing sector to emphasise the importance of securing the maximum returns from the market place. Bord Bia recently launched a promotion campaign on the French market to underpin the marketing of Irish lamb there by our exporting firms.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contribution of the price of lamb in the consumer price index, the survey period for May included the Easter period when lamb prices were at their highest and ended on 9 May before the fall in producer lamb prices which took place later in the month. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has engaged consultants to examine, among other things, the reasons for the differences between producer and consumer prices in the beef sector. The report of the consultants, which is expected shortly, should also be relevant to the lamb sector in large measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The processors could pay up to 10p a pound more; they are part of the problem. The Minister should call them in and bring them to book. Does the Minister agree the real problem lies with the current premium scheme, where the 100 day retention period ends on 28 April and a glut comes on to the market? That the retention period is the same for everyone is a contributing factor. Does the Minister agree it would be preferable to have an earlier, more flexible retention period? It should be open to farmers on any date <Col N="1424" /> between 1 October and 1 February and the retention period should start 100 days from the date the application is lodged as opposed to the final date of 100 days from the closing date.</P>
      <P>This is subject to European Council regulation. Will the Minister go the EU Council of Ministers and argue for a flexible retention period which would do away with a glut coming on to the market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>When the price of lamb was low, why was the saving not passed on to the consumer? Is there another cartel in operation? What is the Department doing about this? It is outrageous that housewives hear farmers complaining about low prices but when they go to the butchers they are charged high prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if there is a cartel. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is carrying out an investigation into the price of beef and the results, which will be published in the near future, will be of interest to the sheepmeat sector.</P>
      <P>The consumer research carried out by Bord Bia indicated that the French had a positive view of Irish lamb. The main thrust of our lamb programme in France for 2000 is to encourage more French people to try Irish lamb. As part of this Bord Bia implemented the first ever nation-wide promotion of Irish lamb in France under the theme <i>L'Agneau de la Saint Jean</i>. The campaign ran for a six week period from 5 May to 1 July and shows Irish lamb at its best in the height of summer with associated events marking the summer solstice in France. The objective is to promote Irish lamb when sufficient volumes are available for a nation-wide campaign and it will position Irish lamb as a natural product through the association with a high profile traditional festival. The building of this foundation will help provide a solid base for Irish lamb in future.</P>

      <P>Negotiations with the Commission are taking place on the plan as a whole, and the entire plan will have to be approved before any of the four individual measures can commence. These negotiations are now in their final stage. Once they are complete, however, there is a standard formal procedure for approval of all plans that has to take place and by its nature this exercise involves a considerable amount of detail and documentation. It is my objective to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time but it is too early at this stage to give any concrete dates for the likely commencement of the new rural environmental protection scheme.</P>

      <P>A large number of first time applicants have been waiting to make an application for some time. As a result of the fall in cattle numbers because of higher milk yield, more farmers will qualify than was the case under the first REPs. The decline in farming incomes makes REPs very important in sustaining family farms. Will the Minister tell the House when the new rural environmental protection scheme will be introduced? Has there been an evaluation of the first scheme, particularly its benefits for the environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural environmental protection scheme is a good scheme. Ireland has the highest <i>per capita</i> availability of this scheme in the EU, with 45,000 participating. In excess of £200 million per annum has been earmarked for expenditure on the new scheme.</P>
      <P>We made our application in December 1999. We have been continuously in communication with the European Commission since then and we are now at the final stage. If that was the end of it, the situation would be satisfactory because we could get going. The overall scheme, however, including forestry and early retirement, has to be approved. I can only tell the House that we are making every possible effort to expedite the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is a good scheme which supports farm incomes. An evaluation was carried out which outlined its importance, especially for sheep farmers, and I will forward it to Deputy Deenihan. It puts additional cash flow into the disadvantaged areas of the State, and will continue to do so with £200 million per annum earmarked until 2006.</P>

      <P>We were discussing amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte which relates to section 23. I concluded my earlier remarks by stating that <Col N="1428" /> my position as outlined on Committee Stage remains the same. Section 23 is a reasonable compromise between the 1963 legislation and the situation which applies in the UK. I reiterate that the position of freelance journalists is in no way impeded by this measure. That is the position I hold in respect of section 23 and I will be glad to deal with any questions Deputies may wish to pose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is somewhat superfluous. I am probably correct in stating that most of the journalists to which the section refers are contracted to their employers. I assume their contracts would take into account many of the issues under discussion. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the provisions in the Bill override a contract between a journalist and his employer or is the opposite the case?</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment states that &ldquo;the author shall be entitled to the copyright subject to any agreement to the contrary.&rdquo;  If that is the case, I am sure proprietors of newspapers and journalists would ensure all matters of interest to them were dealt with in attempting to reach agreements on contracts. Perhaps, therefore, we have no business interfering with that type of arrangement.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask a number of further questions &ndash; the Minister of State addressed some of them, to a certain extent, on Committee Stage &ndash; about the moral and integrity rights of journalists in respect of works they might produce in the course of their employment by newspapers as staff journalists. These people are, perhaps, more concerned about the rights to which I refer than they are about their economic rights. The Minister of State has gone part of the way in trying to address the concerns of both sides and has upset both sides as a result. However, he seems to think that this is a good thing. Will the Minister of State indicate how a person's moral, integrity and paternity rights come into play in respect of the copyright issue?</P>

      <P>When the Bill was published the owners of the national newspapers were upset about the way it was worded, while journalists were quite satisfied on that score. However, when the Minister of State amended the Bill in the Seanad the journalists became less satisfied. The Minister of State has tried to steer a course midway between the positions held by the newspaper owners and the journalists in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion a number of the arguments about people's concerns were raised on foot of a misconception that different kinds of rights existed under the 1963 Act. For example, a number of photographers who wrote to me indicated that they thought they had certain rights, which they never needed to exercise, under the 1963 Act. However, the Minister of State, when commenting on photography, indicated that the effect of the provision in section 9 of the Copyright Act, 1963, which includes photographs in artistic <Col N="1429" /> works for the purposes of affording them copyright protection, assigns the copyright in photographs to the owner of the film or the photographic medium upon which they are taken.</P>
    <P>Under the 1963 Act, if staff and freelance photographers were supplied with the material on which to make their photographs, the copyright automatically belonged to the newspaper which provided such material. I understand that this arrangement was normal at a certain stage but I do not know whether it still applies. My main point is that photographers, staff and freelance, working for particular newspapers surrendered their ownership of copyright when they used material provided by said newspapers when taking photographs.</P>
    <P>I suspect that these people &ndash; a number of them have been gracious enough to admit it &ndash; had very little knowledge of their actual rights under the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>This is my first contribution in respect of this amendment. Under the circumstances, the wording the Minister of State has introduced will not satisfy everyone. However, I am satisfied that the position of freelance photographers and journalists has been clarified. I hope that the right of staff journalists and photographers to submit their work to media outlets other than newspapers and periodicals will be clearly set down in law.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the integrity of photographers' work is preserved. I hope the Minister will inform me that in regard to abuses of photographs such as digital stitching, moral rights will be sacrosanct. Will he confirm that staff photographers will have a comeback on their employers if photographs are manipulated by the employers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold strong views on this issue and cannot understand why the Minister interfered with the traditional position. The Minister summarised that position earlier:</P>
      <P>I remained convinced of two points, first, that the old exception which favoured print journalists over all other classes of employee was anomalous, unjustifiable and could not be continued and, second, that at the same time, some degree of recognition for the long-established rights of employee journalists should be maintained, in all justice.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were in charge in Northern Ireland, we would never witness any conflict there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about this matter. Why can print journalists not be favoured over other employees? After all, they are the people who create the work. The work is not created by the inputter, the in-house clerical employee or the <Col N="1430" /> printer, although with the advent of modern technology, we no longer have printers. To date, copyright was vested in the journalist or the newspaper or publication for which the journalist worked.</P>
    <P>An <i>Irish Independent</i> journalist might be covering the Euro 2000 final. To date, if <i>The New York Times </i>felt the final was worthy of coverage, that journalist could string for <i>The New York Times</i>, be paid for his or her work and retain copyright. The Minister is now changing that position. I am not suggesting that every journalist will be affected as that is transparently not the case. However, a small number of journalists and photographers will be affected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen spoke about the need for photographers to be able to maintain the integrity of their work and that integrity is being unnecessarily put at risk here. Photographers and photographs are included in the authorship section, section 21, but they are not included in the duration sections, 24 to 31. Notwithstanding the Minister's earlier comments, I am concerned that this legislation does not protect photographers to the extent that they should be protected, nor does it protect them to the same extent as other journalists.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about traditional rights and the current position. I made the point on Committee Stage that we are referring here to employee journalists who should be treated in the same manner as employees in any other business. This legislation also deals with other aspects of the Irish economy, particularly the software industry. The employees of a software company work in a similar environment to newspaper employees and they should be treated equally. Many freelance journalists have their own contracts with employers and will not be restricted by this legislation in any way. We are providing that employee journalists will have limited rights to use material outside the newspaper sphere, of which examples were provided on Committee Stage, and I believe that is a reasonable compromise.</P>
      <P>Deputies Stanton and Owen referred to integrity rights. I remind Members that an exception to integrity rights is outlined in section 107. Section 107(b) refers to a work made for the purpose of a newspaper or periodical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of photography, I circulated Members with an explanatory brief on this matter in advance of Report Stage. This is a complex area which requires further consideration in the next two years as we approach the implementation of the forthcoming EU directive on copyright in the information society. I assure Members that I intend to monitor this situation. Issues have arisen in regard to photography which must be <Col N="1431" /> dealt with prior to the implementation of the directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the position which prevailed in the 1963 Act, where the copyright for a photograph was usually owned by the person who owned the physical negative film on which it was taken, photographers will now start from the position of being recognised as authors of their photographs and, as authors, will be entitled to full economic and moral rights under the copyright law. Employee photographers will be in the same position as journalists under this legislation. I believe that certain moral and integrity right issues require further consideration in the context of the forthcoming EU directive and I assure Members that these issues will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the document to which the Minister refers although I am not saying I did not receive it. I have not read the document which may or may not explain the position to aggrieved photographers, who admittedly have contacted me in greater numbers than journalists, and allay their fears.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of someone working for the <i>Irish Independent</i> who may be an expert on Northern Ireland. There would not be anything unusual about such a journalist being able to sell his or her work to a newspaper in the United States as, to date, they have been paid for such work and retained the copyright. Under the new arrangement, they will not be in a position to have their work published in <i>The New York Times </i>or any other publication because section 23(2) states that an author may use the work for any purpose other than for the purposes of making available that work to newspapers or periodicals without infringing the copyright in the work.</P>
      <P>Journalists will no longer be able to make work available to any periodicals or newspapers other than their own whereas they could do that heretofore. A US newspaper which is interested in the Anglo-Irish situation might be very interested in what an expert Irish writer might have to say and would publish his or her article.</P>
      <P>The Minister was being casual when he said he outlined examples on Committee Stage. If I recall matters correctly, he only instanced one example of an employed journalist being able to use material for the purposes of writing a book. For example, Fintan O'Toole who is, presumably, an employee of <i>The Irish Times </i>wrote <i>Meanwhile Back at the Ranch</i>, based on his work covering the beef tribunal. He may use the material for that purpose. However, if <i>The New York Times </i>or <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>wished to publish work by Fintan O'Toole, under the new arrangement he would not retain copyright of his work but would be precluded by this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Why does the Minister wish to introduce this change? The argument that print journalists should not be advantaged over other employees is neither here or there. Journalists who have the ability to create work of substance &ndash; I know some of them have the ability to write fiction &ndash;  and traditionally enjoy the facility of stringing for foreign newspapers will now find their positions changed. I cannot see the reason for this. The Minister clearly cannot see a reason either because my amendment is his original creation. He did not see the reason for the change when the Bill was discussed on Committee Stage and in the Seanad. What has happened to cause him to change his mind? The arguments for change did not come from the select committee or from Members of the House.</P>

      <P>As with the questions of collection agencies, licensing and so on, the Minister has come down predominantly on one side. In this case he has come down on the side of national newspapers and against a small number of journalists, most of whom probably do not realise that their rights are being curtailed. They will know in the future. The only argument advanced by the Minister is that journalists should not be advantaged over other employees. I do not understand the sense in that. The measure will be especially injurious to photographers, given the nature of their work and the usage of photographs, particularly photographs of unique merit.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the traditional position should be changed. The measure I propose had the support of the Minister at an earlier stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 38, line 35, to delete &ldquo;copy&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not include a definition of the words &ldquo;copy&rdquo; or &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo;. I am advised that the word &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; is more widely acceptable than the word &ldquo;copy&rdquo;. If sheet music is photocopied one speaks of copying the music whereas if the music is played and recorded it is said to be reproduced. This provides a loophole for those who may wish to take advantage of it. The word &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; is more all-encompassing than &ldquo;copy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 38, the Minister uses the term &ldquo;reproduction right&rdquo;. The use of the word &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; throughout the Bill or a clarification <Col N="1433" /> that the words &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; and &ldquo;copy&rdquo; mean the same thing would solve this problem. The Minister understands my argument and I ask him to consider the amendments which would close a possible loophole.</P>
    <P>To copy something could mean to make an exact facsimile whereas a reproduction need not be an exact copy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the term &ldquo;copy&rdquo; is inclusive of the term &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo;. It is a larger and more flexible term and better in this situation. The substitution of the term &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo; could undermine the clarity of the term &ldquo;copy&rdquo;. This view is supported by the office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the owner of the copyright having the exclusive right to undertake or authorise others to undertake all or any of the following acts: to copy the work; to make available to the public the work or; to make an adaptation of the work or to undertake either of the previous two acts in relation to an adaptation. The word &ldquo;copy&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My advice is the opposite to the Minister's but I accept his argument. The Minister must take responsibility for the Bill. I am concerned that someone might take advantage of a loophole by reproducing something in a slightly different format and claiming not to have copied it. I do not understand the Minister's argument that the word &ldquo;copy&rdquo; is a looser term than &ldquo;reproduce&rdquo;. I would have thought the opposite.</P>

    <P>(3) A person who satisfies the conditions specified in<i> subsection (2)</i> shall be deemed to be in the same position as regards infringement of copyright as if he or she had been the holder of a licence granted by the owner of the copyright in question at all material times.</P>
    <P>(4) Where the person intending to play sound recordings in public or to include sound recordings in a broadcast or a cable programme service and the licensing body fail to reach agreement as to fair payment under <i>subsection (2) </i>within a reasonable time, the terms of the proposed agreement shall be referred to the Controller for determination of the amount and terms of payment.</P>
    <P>(5) Where the terms of a proposed agreement are referred to the Controller under <i>subsection (4)</i> a person shall not exercise a right conferred by <i>subsection (1)</i> unless he or she&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) gives notice in writing to the Controller of his or her intention to exercise the right, and of the date on which he or she proposes to begin to do so, and</P>

    <P>(7)  Where no request for payment has been made by the licensing body, or where the amount requested by the licensing body is disputed by the person exercising the right then, pending the making of an order by the Controller under <i>subsection (6)</i>, the person exercising the right shall pay to the licensing body such amount as he or she considers reasonable, and shall notify the licensing body and the Controller of his or her intention to do so.</P>
    <P>(8)  A person exercising the right conferred by <i>subsection (1),</i> or who has given notice to the Controller of his or her intention to do so, may also refer to the Controller the question of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) whether any licence condition, notice of which has been given to him or her by the licensing body in question, is a reasonable condition, or</P>
    <P>(b) whether any information required by the licensing body is information which the licensing body can reasonably require him or her to provide.</P>
    <P>(9) Where a reference is made under <i>subsection (8)</i>, the Controller shall consider the matter and make such order as he or she may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>(10) A person exercising the right conferred by<i> subsection (1)</i> or a licensing body may apply to the Controller to review any order under <i>subsection (6) </i>or <i>(9).</i>(11) An application under <i>subsection (10)</i> may not be made except with the special leave of the Controller&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) within 12 months from the date of the order or of the decision on a previous application under this section, or</P>

    <P>(12) Where an application is made under <i>subsection (10)</i>, the Controller shall consider the matter and make such order confirming or varying the original order as he or she may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances and any order made under this subsection shall be for such period as may be specified by the Controller.</P>
    <P>(13) This section shall not apply in any circumstances where sound recordings are <Col N="1436" /> made available to the public by wire or wireless means in such a way that members of the public may access the sound recordings from a place and at a time individually chosen by them (including the making available of copies of sound recordings through the Internet).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 39, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) There shall be a presumption that material which was published on the Internet may be copied accurately and with an acknowledgement of its source, without formal permission, unless a statement to the contrary is published with the material on the Internet site.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are back to the Internet, the information on which is being added to by the minute. We propose that if a person puts information on the Internet, there should be a presumption that the material is public property and can be copied, unless a statement to the contrary is published with the material on the site. Obviously, if a person copies material accurately he or she should acknowledge from where it was obtained, but it can be difficult to find out who puts information on the Internet. It may not be easy to obtain the formal permission that might be required to copy it.</P>
      <P>Another problem with material on the Internet is that it can be transient, here today and gone tomorrow. If people come across material on the Internet that is extremely useful to them in their jobs or professions, or in education, they should presume they can copy it unless there is a statement on the site stating that permission is required. That permission can then be obtained by certain procedures and making contact with the copyright owner.</P>
      <P>Given the growth of the Internet, this is a useful amendment and I am interested to know the Minister of State's views on it. I hope he has reflected on it since we last spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. We had a discussion earlier about inserting a description of the term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; in the legislation. The Minister said the advice was that he should not. It is incredible that we can have new copyright legislation in the year 2000 without some reference to the Internet. It will be difficult for people to exercise their right of copyright for anything that appears on the Internet. On balance, people who put material on the open channel must assume others will read it and use it if necessary. One pays one's money and takes one's chances if one puts material on the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of material on St. John's Wort and ginkgo biloba and many other fascinating materials which I copied from sites on the Internet when we were debating the issue of herbal medicines. There were no alarm bells or flashing lights telling me I should not copy the information because it belongs to somebody else. The legislation must be clear so that people are not subject to major international legal cases when a <Col N="1438" /> person discovers somebody else has used information he or she had placed on the Internet. One could end up being sued for copying another person's material from the Internet.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this is the existing position and, therefore, it ought to be given expression in law. Otherwise, theoretically, any of us could be sued without our knowledge. Our children access the Internet regularly without any fuss. The amendment is tight in the sense that it requires that an acknowledgement of the source would be made and that unless there is a particular signal that it may not be drawn down, there is a presumption of the right to publish. We should pass this amendment in the public interest and I hope the Minister will be able to accept it.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the references to what we and others, especially young people in third level colleges, copy from the Internet. That is provided for under the legislation because we deal with this under sound recordings where we refer to private and domestic use. We had very lengthy debates about time shifting on this issue and about people recording music on tapes or taping television programmes, with which we will deal later. Use for domestic purposes or private use is covered, which I welcome as one who wants to support the consumer in that case.</P>
      <P>At the time of our discussions, I indicated that such an amendment would effectively require rightsholders to observe a formal requirement prior to the access of their copyright rights, which in this case would involve the placing of a statement or notice on the relevant Internet site. I pointed out that imposing formalities of this sort would be contrary to Article 5.2 of the Berne Convention. This is the first time we mentioned that today; the Deputy was probably waiting for me to say that.</P>

      <P>This article prohibits formalities in respect of the enjoyment and exercise of rights. I subsequently raised this matter with the Office of the Attorney General, which agrees that the proposed amendment would be an unjustifiable restriction of the reproduction rights and would infringe Article 5 of the Berne Convention. The downloading of information for private domestic use is allowable as far as we are concerned. This amendment would introduce a formality which, from the point of view of the rightsholder and of the user, makes the situation worse. Therefore, I ask the Deputy to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to make. I welcome the Minister's statement which I think means that people who use the Internet for private and domestic purposes can copy material <Col N="1439" /> from it for their own use. That is to be welcomed. If, for example, a person in the medical field discovers new and useful information on the Internet, which is used increasingly as a tool for disseminating such information, is the Minister saying he or she will not be allowed to copy this information without obtaining permission from the source, unless there is a statement on the site stating it is copyright protected? This is the kind of clarification we are seeking.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State, who also has special responsibility for consumer rights, make it known to the public at large that they will break the law if they copy material from the Internet? </P>

This is a very serious issue especially where the Minister is saying, and rightly so, that schools, towns, business and the public at large should use the Internet. However, we are still tied with copyright in this case.</P>
      <P>We do not want people to be prosecuted. Will the Minister clarify the requirement? He has acknowledged that people do not know the position and are probably breaking the law all over the State as we speak.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy referred to this because I can confirm there is an exception for people who copy material for educational or scientific purposes, but I agree this area may change in the years ahead. I refer back to the point I made earlier about the debate at EU level where some countries hold a strong position in regard to rights holders. The Irish position put forward by me and my predecessor has always been to keep the balance between rights holders and users. There are exceptions which relate to private and domestic use and to people who use material from the Internet for educational and scientific purposes.</P>

      <P>A constituent of mine in his 70s called me when a new IT product came on the market and he complained about not being able <Col N="1440" /> to access it and about not knowing the costs involved. The Minister of State does not recognise that between now and the conclusion of the negotiations before something more is done in this area, anybody innocently downloading material from the Internet could be subject to a legal action.</P>
      <P>Section 38(2) provides a reproduction right to the copyright owner. There should be a right of the owner to copy a work or to authorise others to do so which shall be known as the &ldquo;reproduction right&rdquo;. However, anybody who trawls through the Internet to find out who wrote an article on St. John's Wort, for example, does not call the author in a university in Outer Mongolia or Malaysia to ask if he or she can download the article because there will be a debate on the subject in Parliament. That is work related and is not educational. The wording in this section does not cover an individual downloading material form the Internet, unless a statement to the contrary is published with the material. The Minister of State may think he has a few years to play with this but this is a pressing issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for her realistic assessment of what is happening. If an individual published something on the Internet, there is a presumption that it will be downloaded. I agree that the Internet is a tremendous development because people who need such information quickly have access to information, whether they are politicians or students. It is a tremendous facility. As Minister of State with responsibility for a number of areas, including consumer affairs, I support that right and will ensure on behalf of the Government that it is protected. I was trying to look ahead and flag the issues which will be raised at EU level, to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>For example, there are many possible developments regarding the downloading of music in terms of implementing rights protection measures. The music industry is availing of the Internet and the rights of the rightsholder, the artists, etc. must be considered. That will need to be addressed. There is a huge ongoing debate in the music industry. The Government and I seek to maintain a balance between the consumer and the rightsholder. I am highlighting possible issues that will be addressed in future.</P>

    <P>This amendment was also discussed on Committee Stage. The Minister of State stated that reference to copies would include the originals. Some people feared that originals could be used or abused in some way. If the Minister of State assures the House that copies and originals are the same, I will be happy. Music was referred to earlier. It is possible to create compact discs which are replicas of the originals. We want to make clear that copies include originals. If many copies are produced, where is the original? These are then made available to the public. I will be happy if copies and originals are considered to be the same.

      <P>The advice I was given on Committee Stage following consultation with the office of the Attorney General is the same. He advised that in law the term &ldquo;copy&rdquo; includes the original which in effect is the first copy. The term was used in the Copyright Act, 1963, without any difficulty arising, and I do not consider it necessary to accept the amendment. In any event section 39(2) specifically provides that: &ldquo;References in this Part to the making available to the public of copies of a work shall include the making available to the public of the original of the work&rdquo;.

      <P>In page 40, line 19, after &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;retains control over the copies so made available&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 39(4) states: &ldquo;..where a person who provides facilities referred to in that subsection is notified by the owner of the copyright in the work concerned that those facilities are being used to infringe the copyright in that work.&rdquo;. An individual could use a photocopying machine at work but copies could be made elsewhere in the same building. This refers to people retaining ownership and control over the copies and inserted in the subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger of the wording in this subsection is that if I provide copying facilities and I am not looking over the shoulder of the person making the copies, when he or she leaves the copying room they become infringing copies and I carry the can and am blamed. We wanted to make sure that in putting the blame on the person who is providing the facilities, that person maintains control over the copies, and that they equally have responsibility for the copies. If the person left the building, however, one could have a situation whereby a totally innocent person who, in the words of subsection (4) &ldquo;fails to <Col N="1442" /> remove that infringing material as soon as practicable thereafter, that person shall also be liable for the infringement&rdquo;. The amendment seeks to keep the person who is making the facilities available married to, or in touch with, the copies so that they would end up becoming a party to an act of infringement. It is in fairness to the person who is providing the facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the kind of situation the Deputies are referring to, but we are talking about the electronic media here, not a photocopier. The subsection refers to the &ldquo;notify and take down&rdquo; provisions of the Bill, which are designed to allow a rightsholder to place an effective obligation on a person in control of a computer facility, such as a website, to remove infringing material from it, or become liable for infringement themselves. Since the act of taking down the infringing material would both satisfy the requirements of the subsection and effectively place it beyond the control of the person with obligations under this provision, I do not believe this amendment is necessary to protect innocent parties, although I appreciate what Deputies have said in relation to that matter. I would be afraid that it would confuse the meaning of the subsection with no real benefit in return and, therefore, I would ask Deputies not to press the amendment.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the electronic media. If somebody photocopies infringing material, they should be pursued legally, perhaps under another section of the Bill. This section, however, deals with the &ldquo;notify and take down&rdquo; provision.</P>

If Eircom receives notification from the owner of the copyright that they must remove the work and they fail to do so, they are liable for prosecution &ndash; that is provided they retain control over the matter, but the web is so interactive that it can go from one service provider to another. This brings us back to the issue of technology. I can see what the Minister is getting at, but will he clarify whether we are talking about Internet service providers more than other matters?</P>

      <P>In page 43, line 27, after &ldquo;making&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the issues of copies thereof to the public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a clarification. The section deals with importing material into the State. Section 43(2)(<i>b</i>) states that a copy shall be an infringing copy where it has been or is to be imported into the State, and its making in the State would have constituted an infringement of the copyright in the work concerned, or a breach of an exclusive licence agreement relating to that work. We have been told that it was important to introduce that provision, and that not just the making of it but the issuing as well would also have been an infringement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify this, my understanding is that these amendments aim to impose copyright sanction on distribution of books in the State, which does not take place within the normal channels of supply. I am advised that this point was raised by CLE, the book publishers association, at the hearing in November last of interested parties, hosted by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. My Department sought legal advice on this point from the Office of the Attorney General. It advised that the distribution right in physical copies of work is governed by particular provisions of EU law. The office took the view that changes along the lines suggested in the amendments could infringe EU law regarding the distribution right, which does not permit the Internal Market of the EU and physical copies of works to be partitioned by copyright law provisions. Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>The amendments could breach EU law on distribution rights. If work is made available in one state, it is legally available in other member states. This is the conflict. An EU regulation on distribution rights would be infringed by the insertion of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 30 seeks the insertion of &ldquo;or exhibits in public or distributes&rdquo;<Col N="1446" /> in page 44. There is an old adage that there is more than one way to skin a cat. Section 44 states:</P>
      <P>A person infringes the copyright in a work where he or she without the licence of the copyright owner&ndash;</P>
      <P>(d) otherwise than in the course of a business, trade or profession, makes available to the public to such an extent as to prejudice the interests of the owner of the copyright.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert, after &ldquo;makes available to the public.&rdquo;, &ldquo;or exhibits in public or distributes&rdquo;. There is a difference between making material available to the public and exhibiting material in public. A person could exhibit material in public which people will not buy or take away with them. However, the showing of material in public could be of help to the copyright owner. There is a subtle difference between making material available to the public and distributing or exhibiting material in public.</P>
      <P>The provision must be clear. I would assume the phrase &ldquo;makes available to the public&rdquo; meant material was available in a shop or was being handed out to members of the public. Has the Minister received good advice on this matter? Is he satisfied with the position? Will he explain the position with regard to European law? Is it the case that a work of art or literature brought from another EU country could not be made available to the public without infringing the copyright? Is the Minister suggesting that the inclusion of the amendment would prevent it being made available to the public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that distribution rights are covered under EU regulations and copyright law cannot be used to interfere with those rights. There would be an exhaustion of rights in the context of distribution rights. The amendments attempt to deal with distribution through copyright legislation, but an EU regulation governs this area. My advice is that cannot be done.</P>

      <P>We accept the Minister's expert advice on this matter. However, a question arises if, for example, a person has access to a bootleg printing press abroad, produces books, brings them into the State and distributes them. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if that person would be in breach of some distribution law but not necessarily copyright law. Would copyright law not come into play? The main concern of CLÉ is that people would not get away with printing a book abroad, bringing it into the country and distributing it. This is the type of query that has been raised.</P>

My problem is that the amendment relates to a different area of law in terms of the legal importation area and parallel <Col N="1447" /> imports. The amendments do not fit into copyright legislation which is complex enough already. My advice is that the matter relates to a different area of legislation regarding distribution. The amendments would interfere with legal aspects in that area. However, it is important to protect rightsholders with regard to bootleg productions and this is covered under Irish copyright law.</P>

      <P>In page 45, to delete lines 39 to 45, and in page 46, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to excise section 49(3) which relates to fair dealing and stipulates that the copying by a person is not fair dealing in the circumstances prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b). One relates to more than three copies while the other relates to more than one copy. It is an entirely unnecessary restriction. It goes too far in terms of what the Minister is seeking to do. The regulation is so carefully prescribed in terms of all the detail that I do not understand why it is necessary to include it again and the amendment seeks its excision.</P>

      <P>We are going over ground covered on Committee Stage, but I gave the matter considerable thought since the last discussion. Deputies should be aware that the Bill introduces exceptions in favour of librarians for the first time in Irish law. However, these exceptions must be limited and in line with the three step test outlined in Article 9.2 of the Berne Convention &ndash; I am reminded of &ldquo;The Three Steps to Heaven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the three steps are that exceptions must be specific and limited; they must not conflict with the normal exportation of a work; and exceptions must not unreasonably prejudice a legitimate instrument of the author. This is the position and I am not convinced that opening up the fair dealing provisions to librarians beyond that proposed in section 49 (2) would be acceptable within the <Col N="1448" /> terms of the convention. In any event, these exceptions will be kept under review. If significant problems arise for librarians in the future, I will reconsider the matter. I assure the Deputy that I will monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the reasoning behind constraining librarians or archivists in this fashion. The Minister mentioned the Berne Convention.

      <P>In page 46, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;reasonably justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;which will not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the owner of the copyright&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Copyright Act, 1963, uses the term &ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; in relation to certain copyright exceptions but does not define that term. In the interests of clarity, the definition of this term has been included in the new Bill at section 49(2). This definition was based on wording used in the EU database directive. However, having considered this matter further, I am of the view that this definition which includes the phrase, &ldquo;to an extent reasonably justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved&rdquo;, could be deemed to be too restrictive, especially in the case of fair dealing for the purpose of criticism or review which arguably has a commercial aspect to it. This is also the point raised by Deputies Owen and Stanton in their amendment.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I propose amendments Nos. 32, 120 and 138b which I consider clarify the meaning of the term &ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; for the purposes of the relevant exceptions of copyright, performers' property rights and database rights, respectively, and which is not overly burdensome on the user, while protecting the interests of rightsholders. I am responding to points made by Deputies on Committee Stage and I thank them for their suggestions. This will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;52.&ndash;The copyright in a work is not infringed by its publication in the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section before the part of the Bill dealing with education. The section would state: &ldquo;The copyright in a work is not infringed by its publication in the public interest&rdquo;. The origin of this idea is a submission we heard from RTE. It is common nowadays for a particular document to leak into the public domain. Whatever else might be said about the merits of the leak, it could also be a breach of copyright. This amendment seeks to enter a public interest defence. It seems the merits of the controversy that would ensue, the type of circumstances I have postulated, will look after themselves. However, that an action for infringement of copyright might be a consideration is unreal.</P>
      <P>There should be a public interest defence. For example, there have been a number of celebrated cases where documents came into the public domain and where it was manifestly in the public good that they did so. The common good demanded it and benefited from it. In that sense, there is a public interest defence. Will the Minister take on board that an action for infringement of copyright should not be one of the considerations for publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall our discussions on this matter on Committee Stage. I have a great deal of sympathy for Deputy Rabbitte's position. This <Col N="1451" /> issue is quite common, particularly in the media if quotations and various documents are leaked to them. Issues of privacy and confidentiality might be more appropriate to this area.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage I outlined that such an exception has not any basis in either EU or international law and that such a defence would appear to be open to serious abuse. One could have unmeritorious defendants claiming to have committed infringements in the public interest in order to frustrate or delay rights holders seeking to uphold their rights in law. Since Committee Stage I have raised the matter with the Attorney General's office which advises that copyright is a valuable form of property and the person entitled to the copyright in a work may suffer severe injustice if this right is unduly restricted. The office agrees that such an exception is open to abuse. Accordingly, while I appreciate the Deputy's concern, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a case of trying to strike the right balance and to protect property rights. My view is supported by EU and international law and by the Attorney General's office. The position I am taking on copyright does not interfere with what is common in journalistic practices.</P>

      <P>I do not know if a person would hide behind copyright law to prevent something from being put into the public domain in the public interest. However, I would be concerned if that happened. In other words, if copyright law was the only defence that someone could use to prevent a document or whatever from entering the public domain, that would not be right. I understand the Minister's problem. There are other issues here. I do not see where privacy or confidentiality comes into it or how this proposed amendment could possibly be abused, but there is an issue here. If somebody could hide behind copyright law as a last line of defence to prevent some document entering the public domain, that should be examined, especially if examples of that occurred in the past or are likely to occur in the future. I am not aware of any such examples but perhaps others are so aware.</P>

      <P>The objective here is not to take away the property interest from whomsoever might have copyright. The objective is to merely ensure that the person concerned would not be open to an action for infringing copyright by virtue of publication. The history of the public service, perhaps more so on the neighbouring island than here, may not be peppered with examples but there have been some dramatic examples of documents that came into the public domain that were in the public interest. I am not sure if the Minister's position is informed by anything more than the natural caution of the bureaucracy to protect itself. In the early days the same arguments were made about the Freedom of Information Act and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sometimes puzzled by the weight the <Col N="1452" /> Minister has attached to representations made to him from, say, the national newspapers but when RTE comes to him with an argument that is researched and well based and so on, he does not seem to think that any weight attaches to it and that it is covered by privacy and confidentiality. This amendment is seeking to do no more than say there can be a public interest defence against an action for infringement of copyright. Surely public interest dimensions are foreseeable in terms of that kind of proposition. I am disappointed if the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of as much information as possible getting into the public domain under the Freedom of Information Act, as the Deputy mentioned, and the regime that has been in place for some years. There is a provision for that greater degree of openness but I am simply making the point that the Attorney General has advised me that the copyright owner &ndash; and it is a valuable form of property &ndash; is entitled to the copyright in a work being protected and he or she may suffer severe injustice if the right is unduly restricted. That is the argument made to me by the Attorney General and I accept that advice.</P>

      <P>In the interests of clarity I am taking amendment No. 43 with No. 123, and I will not accept the other amendments in this group.

    <P>On amendment No. 45, I recall considerable discussion on this subject on Committee Stage. In particular, Deputies were anxious to ensure that, for example, this section would cover small <Col N="1454" /> specialist libraries and archives to which only limited members of the public have access. At that time I advised that the concept of an establishment to which the public has access is one which is broadly defined in law. Since then, the office of the Attorney General has confirmed to me that the section, as it is currently drafted, is open to broad interpretation and would cover situations where only a limited number of the public have access, whether just by invitation of the owner or with his or her permission. A number of examples were given on Committee Stage. That situation will be covered by this exception while libraries that are run for a commercial purpose are not. I trust that this clarifies the matter. I have endeavoured to accommodate the concerns of Deputies raised in the course of our Committee Stage discussions.</P>

Subsection (2) of this amendment states: &ldquo;The Minister shall prescribe the educational establishments and the establishments to which members of the public have access for the purposes of subsection (1)&rdquo;. Are educational establishments and establishments to which members of the public have access for the purposes of subsection (1) the same, or will the Minister of State prescribe something as an educational establishment and something else as an establishment to which members of public will have access? In other words, will he prescribe schools and colleges as educational establishments and cinemas, shops, etc. as establishments to which the public will have access? This is the point about which I was confused on Committee Stage. When I asked the Minister of State if he knew the purpose of this section, he said the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; qualifies the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;. I asked him what it refers to and whether the educational aspect of public access will be specified. I would be pleased if the Minister of State can convince me that the two types of establishments are same. Will the Minister of State prescribe establishments that are educational establishments to which the public will have access, but not prescribe establishments that are educational establishments to which the public do not have access? That is the point I want clarified.</P>

      <P>Confusion could arise about this aspect. I understand the intent of the section a little better now that it has been redrafted. The Minister of State is saying he will get a list of places that are educational establishments. That is straightforward because one assumes people have access to such establishments. He will also have to get another list of establishments to which members of the public have access for the purposes of education or obtaining information. What about establishments to which members of the public have access through a library or educational establishment? The Minister of State referred to a library in a solicitors firm. I understand that members of the public, through other libraries, have access to such libraries. If a member of the public requires a copy of the fourth volume of the road traffic Acts published in, say, 1986 and a public library contacts a library in a solicitors firm for that volume and it is made available to the public library, that constitutes public access. A member of the public may not be able to walk into the library of a solicitors firm and request a particular book, but he or she may get access to such a book in another way. There is an arrangement for the informal lending of expensive and rare books among academics. Has the Minister of State given consideration to the meaning of public access in terms of the lending of books? Public access is not confined to access in terms of members of the public going to a library and requesting a book.</P>

      <P>This amendment refers to section 39. Section 39(1) states &ldquo;References in this Part to the making available to the public of a work shall be construed as including all or any of the following.&rdquo;. Section 39(1)(<i>g</i>) states &ldquo;lending copies of the work without the payment of remuneration to the owner of the copyright in the work,&rdquo;. Is the Minister saying certain establishments do not have to pay remuneration to the owner of the copyright in the work, provided that such establishments are educational and members of the public have access to them? What is the position regarding establishments that do not fit that category, which I presume would include the Oireachtas Library?</P>

      <P>With regard to establishments to which only some members of the public have access, the Deputies have raised important matters regarding the regulations that will be implemented. I mentioned the example of private libraries in solicitors firms which are run for commercial purposes. The Oireachtas Library is for Members of the Dáil and Seanad and is limited. What we are looking at here is a place to which a limited public would have access. It will vary from case to case. I ask for trust in the Minister of the day to take account of that aspect. I am not sure about the Law Library but the King's Inns would have access to a limited public, barristers and students.</P>

These photocopying machines should not be made available unless a licence from a licensing body authorising such copying is held or there is no such licence available.

      <P>I did not realise the amendment was included in that group of amendments. I adverted to it in passing but it is the substantive amendment of the group. The outstanding remaining grievance that librarians and archivists have with the Bill is that the Minister is imposing a restriction on interlibrary borrowing, which is crucial to the functioning of the library system. Librarians believe the Bill will constrain their ability to carry out normal business among themselves. Frequently when Members go to the Oireachtas Library, the staff have to go to a library outside to get the particular book or report we are seeking.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister wishes to take a stand against this. Whose rights are being damaged as a result of section 39(1)(g) not applying to this limited area of interlibrary borrowing? I cannot see an issue of property rights of any significance involved. There is an issue of the public good. People who use libraries are entitled to get information. This practice is a convention in the library system. The Minister will have received a submission from the <i>ad hoc</i> librarians group which makes a great deal of sense. The librarians have no vested interest or axe to grind. They are merely trying to retain the freedom to conduct their business as they always have without leaving themselves open to allegations of infringing copyright legislation.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. It is one of the few matters that still worry archivists and librarians. If this amendment is accepted, they say it will remedy a deficiency in Part II of the Bill at section 57. The deficiency arises from the fact that in the case of lending, the exemption does not cover borrowing and in all such exemptions for educational establishments there is currently no power conferred on the Minister to prescribe other categories of libraries apart from the establishments open to the public.</P>
      <P>This is the point I made earlier. Lending takes place from libraries which are not open to the public but from which other libraries and archivists borrow. Private libraries are an example. People might have inherited fine private libraries which would not be open to the public but whose books can be borrowed for study or other such reasons. The Minister has not dealt with this deficiency.</P>

    <P>The Minister and I might be at cross purposes on this matter. There could still be a situation where a document in the circumstances envisaged by subsection (2) may not be appended to a report. Take, for example, a Committee of Public Accounts report. If the work was previously and lawfully made available to the public, it could not be published as an appendix to a Government <Col N="1463" /> report or a parliamentary committee report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be confusion about the purpose of section 72(2). This is designed to prevent the necessary exception in favour of certain communications by the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas from being abused, in particular by reprinting under their imprint works which have already been published or made available through the normal, usually commercial, channels.</P>
      <P>That might appear unrealistic but I am advised that discussions on this matter have taken place in the context of the negotiations on the EU directive on copyright in the information society which suggests that the enactment of a provision along the lines of section 72(2) is necessary if the section 72 exception as a whole is to be regarded as compliant with EU and international copyright law.

      <P>The international legal position is a powerful argument. However, take the example of the DIRT report and a document which is lawfully available to the public in the manner prescribed here. Could that be published as part of the report? Section 72(2) provides that the Government or either or both Houses of the Oireachtas shall not make available to the public copies of a work referred to in subsection (1) or cause the work to be copied or made available under this section where the work has previously been lawfully made available to the public otherwise than under this section.</P>
      <P>There are any number of circumstances where the work could have been previously lawfully made available to the public and a parliamentary committee might wish to publish its report with that work appended to it by way of explanation. I am trying to establish whether section 72(2) permits that. Does it constrain the Houses of the Oireachtas, either House of the Oireachtas, a parliamentary committee or the Government from engaging in what might be considered conventional practice up to now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This would relate to a book, for example, or a document published outside which would be given to the committee. This is effectively trying to give some degree of protection to that author in the context of the use of the material. This would not affect the DIRT report. I referred to work made available through the normal commercial channels. A better example from the point of view of my argument would be that the committee in question would not reproduce the book without the permission of the owner. That is the angle I am pursuing. I am trying to give some degree of protection to the individual from outside to protect that property right. This may not happen in many cases but the issue has been raised at EU level and I believe it <Col N="1464" /> should be included here. However, I do not want to introduce legislation which would restrict the concerns of the Deputy and the types of publications to which he referred. The report of a committee will not be restricted. There is just the element of someone from outside producing a book, for example, which is commercially available. I am concerned about that possible use of an individual's work and I feel it is necessary in the context of EU discussions to deal with that issue from the rightsholder's point of view.</P>

      <P>The Minister's assurances are on the record. In conclusion, I will give a hard example. The Minister of State instanced the case of a book or article. In his closing submission to the DIRT hearing, the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, on behalf of Allied Irish Banks, adverted to a number of authorities the members of the sub-committee ought to read. Let us say a particular article was an authority on some aspect of the law with which he was concerned on behalf of his client. May the committee append that or part of that to the report by way of illustration of a particular point or whatever?</P>

      <P>I am advised that situation is covered in section 72(1). I presume the author would have anticipated that situation arising. I accept the validity of the Deputy's case. The case I am making is based on possibly unrealistic situations. Many aspects of the legislation stem from international obligations and experiences elsewhere. The situation the Deputy presented would be dealt with and covered in section 72(1) where the author would have anticipated such a situation arising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was discussed on Committee Stage when the Minister stated that commercial and non-commercial purposes are included. If he gives that assurance I will withdraw the amendments. The amendments were tabled to ensure that programme makers would not be infringing copyright if the reading or recitation of poems or literary or dramatic works were part of a programme that was used for commercial purposes. The Minister gave an assurance that that was the <Col N="1465" /> case. He will allay the fears of these people if he gives that assurance again.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) This section does not apply if or to the extent that there is a licensing scheme in force providing for the granting of licences to authorise such copying.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arise here. Section 88 reads, &ldquo;Where an article or a scientific or technical subject is lawfully made available to the public .. it is not an infringement of the copyright in the abstract or in the article to copy the abstract or to make available to the public copies of the abstract .&rdquo;.  The fear is that very often abstracts contain the main salient points in the actual publication. One can make use of and obtain the information just by having the abstract. There is a fear that abstracts may be reduced in size as a result of this. There is also a fear that people's work may be exploited as a result of this section if abstracts are copied without permission being required. The amendment seeks that this section does not apply if or to the extent that there is a licensing scheme in force providing for the granting of licences to authorise such copying. That will tighten up the section. I know the Minister had reservations about this issue and I would like to hear what he has to say.</P>

      <P>It is amazing how we are moving from the interests of users to copyright holders. Perhaps this reflects the fact that this is balanced legislation. This amendment would restrict the ability of the publishing and scientific communities to disseminate copies of abstracts of scientific and technical works where licensing schemes aimed at controlling such copying existed. Copying of this nature may be particularly advantageous not only to the scientific community but also to publishers of scholarly works in drawing the attention of scholars to the published work of their peers. I would not favour the adoption of this amendment at this time since it would be inconsistent with the particular balance which I wish to strike between the rights, in particular, of users of such material and its publishers in the Bill. Deputies will appreciate that it is implicit in my comments both on Committee Stage debate and in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad that I regard the role of scientific and technical copying as highly sensitive. In consequence, I will be keeping this balance under active review and will not hesitate to propose legislation to adjust it <Col N="1466" /> should this prove necessary. For this reason, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment and I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 60, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>90.&ndash;(1) In this section&ndash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;artist' means the author of an original work of art;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;artist's resale right' means the right of the artist granted in this section;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;artist's resale royalty' means the percentage of the proceeds of the sale of the work to which the artist is entitled under this section;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;original works of art' means works of graphic or plastic art, including pictures, paintings, collages, drawings, engravings, prints, etchings, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, and copies of works of art which have been made in limited numbers by or with the authority of the artist, and &lsquo;original work of art' shall be construed accordingly;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;registered licensing body' means a collecting society representing artists which is registered under the provisions of <i>Part III, Chapter 8 </i>of this Act;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;sale price' means the price at which the original work of art is sold, exclusive of all taxes and seller's commission;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the intermediary' means the agent or agency acting as intermediary between the purchaser and the seller, such as organisers of public sales and auctions, art galleries and in general, any dealers in works of art;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the seller' means the person or persons entitled to receive the sale price of an original work of art.</P>
      <P>(2) The author of an original work of art shall, subject to the provisions of this section, have the right to receive a percentage of the proceeds of all sales of the work subsequent to the first sale or transfer of ownership thereof.</P>
      <P>(3) The artist's resale right shall be inalienable and incapable of waiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) The artist's resale right shall apply to all acts of resale of original works of art involving sellers, buyers or intermediary art market professionals, such as salerooms, art galleries, and in general, any dealers in works <Col N="1467" /> of art, which take place from the date or enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>(5)(a) The artist's resale royalty shall be payable by the seller within three months of the date of sale of the original work of art.</P>
    <P>(b) The levying and payment of the royalty to a party specified in<i> subsection (9) </i>shall be the responsibility of the person who engages in the sale of, or who serves as the intermediary for, original works of art.</P>
    <P>(6) (a) The amount of the artist's resale royalty shall be determined, from time to time, by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b) No artist's resale royalty shall be payable in respect of a sale where the seller shall prove that the resale price of the work does not exceed the purchase price paid by the seller.</P>
    <P>(c) No artist's resale right shall apply to the particular situation of art galleries which acquire works directly from the artist, providing the resale takes place within three years of the acquisition.</P>
    <P>(7) The artist's resale right shall endure for the same period as the copyright term.</P>
    <P>(8) The artist's resale royalty shall be payable to the artist, and after his or her death to any of the following parties: the artist's personal representative; the beneficiary of the artist's resale royalty under the will of the artist, it having been admitted to probate; the heir at law of the artist in the event that the artist died intestate and no grant of administration to her or his estate has been extracted.</P>
    <P>(9) It shall be a sufficient discharge of the seller's obligation to pay the artist's resale royalty if the seller or the intermediary shall pay the same to a registered licensing body or to an agent appointed to act on behalf of any parties specified in <i>subsection (8)</i> hereof.</P>
    <P>(10) In the event that the person entitled to receive an artist's resale royalty cannot after reasonable enquiry be ascertained or identified by the seller of an original work of art, and there is in existence no registered collecting body, then the amount of the royalty shall be held in trust by the seller for the person entitled to receive it for a period of three years from the date of sale, and thereafter the obligation to pay the artist's resale royalty shall be at an end.</P>
    <P>(11) (a) The seller of an original work of art shall be obliged, upon receipt of a request in that behalf, to furnish to any of the parties specified in <i>subsection (8)</i> or <i>(9)</i> hereof, details of the sale price of such original works of art and the date of sale of same.</P>
    <P>(b) An agent or representative of sellers of <Col N="1468" /> original works of art and an organiser of a sale of original works of art shall be obliged, upon receipt of a request in that behalf, to furnish to any of the parties specified in <i>subsections (8) </i>and <i>(9)</i> hereof, details of the sale price and date of sale of all sales of original works of art conducted the preceding year in which the party requesting the information has an interest. In the event the artist's resale royalty has not been paid within the period specified in <i>subsection (5), </i>the agent shall be also obliged to provide the name and address of the seller on receipt of a request for such information.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment. Since and during Committee Stage, there have been major moves in Europe in this area. At the moment if an artist produces work which is a once-off painting, sculpture or whatever and that work is sold on for, say, £100, if five, ten or 20 years later that work increases in value and is resold for £1,000 or £10,000, the original artist gets no recognition for the work in this jurisdiction. In other jurisdictions artists have a legal right to receive a percentage of the resale value. This is included in copyright law.</P>
    <P>When the artist dies, his or her work often increases in value because no more can be produced. The artist's heirs, however, get nothing from this increase in value. We have done much for artists in this State but if the Minister accepted this amendment it would be a sign that we support them in their work. The Artists Association of Ireland is anxious for moves to be made to recognise this right in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The last time the Minister discussed <i>droit de suite</i> he refused to introduce it to the Bill. Major interests in Britain were anxious to stay out of any agreement but the British Government has since moved and reached agreement with Europe. We must show artists that we want to help them and their heirs. I know artists who live from hand to mouth. This would be of practical help to them &ndash; in the event of their work increasing in value, they would get a percentage of the resale value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a modern concept and I do not understand why the Minister has set his face against including this in the legislation. On 16 February there was an article in a British newspaper by Neil Buckley in Brussels which stated that Britain was to agree a deal on resale rights for artists. The British Government has pulled back from its opposition to <i>droit de suite</i> being included in the next EU directive. My argument on Committee Stage is even more relevant now. Why can the Minister not put this element into the legislation with the proviso that the timing will be determined by a Minister? Within a year of the enactment of the legislation, an EU directive will cover <i>droit de suite</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first recorded case of copyright infringement relates to the visual arts in sixth century <Col N="1469" /> Donegal. St. Finnian accused St. Colmcille of copying the illuminated text from the Book of Durrow without his position. High King Diarmuid studied the case and decreed, &ldquo;To every cow its calf and to every book its copy.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to malign St. Colmcille. Diarmuid's judgment led to a huge battle in which thousands died, and Colmcille was banished and exiled to Iona, with many years passing before he returned to Ireland. That was copyright in the sixth century. Can the Minister imagine the battles in the 21st century when the artists' association realises that he has refused to do what High King Diarmuid did in the sixth century &ndash; to recognise the artist's right to <i>droit de suite</i>?</P>
      <P>Many artists are not that famous when they first sell their work. Suddenly they become popular and everyone wants to buy their work. Something sold for £1,000 is being sold for £250,000 within a short space of time. The artist is left in his garret unable to replace his brushes because someone else has walked off with £249,000 profit on his artistic endeavour. The Minister understands this &ndash; he is a musician. If other creators are benefiting from copyright and getting some recompense for the endeavour they put into their work, it is incredible that visual artists are not.</P>
      <P>Now that the British have decided to accept<i> droit de suite</i>, we should set an example. The Minister should put it into this Bill. He may not be there in a year to insert it once the directive comes into force. Deputy Stanton, Deputy Rabbitte or I will be in his job in a matter of months and we will receive credit from artists for the rest of our lives for introducing <i>droit de suite</i> into the copyright legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have the courage of his convictions and accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour <i>droit de suite</i> and I want to see this legislation coming into being. On taking up my position, however, I saw both sides of the argument. The last Government had concerns about the introduction of <i>droit de suite</i> and the arguments were well balanced. I said on Committee Stage that it is unrealistic for us to introduce it in the context of this comprehensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Irish <i>droit de suite</i> is on the way on foot of the EU directive which recently received a common position at the Internal Market Council. I was glad to be there to support that. The text of the directive will be subject to a Second Reading in the European Parliament and, doubtless, members of Fine Gael will be involved in that. The final text may not be known to member states for some time to come and that is another reason to refrain from introducing a <i>droit de suite</i> into this Bill. It would be more opportune to wait for the finalisation of the terms of this directive <Col N="1470" /> so a settled scheme of artists' resale rights can be introduced.</P>
    <P>I noted the points raised on Committee Stage and I will contact the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to discuss the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to examine <i>droit de suite</i> in a manner consistent with the terms of the directive, once they become clear.</P>
    <P>The examination will have to give full weight to the views of all relevant interests, including those of the professional art trade, the economic health of which is of great benefit to artists. Any consequent action will be based on clear Government decisions following the conclusion of this process.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for tabling this detailed amendment. I also thank Deputy Owen for the history lesson about High King Diarmuid and I will respond to her concerns on this matter in due course. The next step in the process will involve my working closely with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Following that, I will communicate with the Deputies in respect of this matter at the earliest opportunity. I acknowledge the work the Deputies have done in drafting this amendment but my position has not changed since Committee Stage. However, I have made it clear that I favour the introduction of an Irish <i>droit de suite</i>.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's indication that he has changed his position, that he favours the introduction of <i>droit de suite</i> and that he is in the process of initiating the drafting of legislation in this regard. I hope that legislation will appear, provided it is still in office, on the Government's legislative programme in the autumn. I will not revisit the arguments in respect of this matter because the Minister of State is already familiar with them. I congratulate him on making this major concession.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for adopting a more positive attitude to the concept of <i>droit de suite</i>. Europe has moved on in this area and Ireland has lagged behind. When Tony Blair came to Ireland he stated that the British would assist us in respect of grants for farmers provided we reciprocated in respect of the <i>droit de suite</i> issue. A total of 50 countries worldwide, 11 of them in the EU, have introduced <i>droit de suite</i> legislation. I thank the Minister of State for conceding the point but I intend to press the amendment.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage Deputies raised concerns about the use of the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; in these sections. Having considered the matter further, I have decided to return to the wording used in the Copyright Act, 1963, which, to my knowledge, did not cause any difficulties in this regard.

      <P>No, but it is the Minister of State who is proposing to substitute the word &ldquo;special&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo;. On Committee Stage we made an attempt to arrive at a definition of discrete. It is a word which conjures all sorts of images in terms of one being in a grubby hotel late at night and being told that if you pay a discreet charge one might gain access to a particular form of entertainment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's amendment, which has given rise to great interest in the Members' bar, proposes the substitution of the term &ldquo;special&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo;. I want to be able to give guidance to people who instead of paying a discrete charge will be obliged to pay a special charge. I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to the trouble of consulting the dictionary because I did not know the difference between the words &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; and &ldquo;special&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; used in the section is different from the word &ldquo;discreet&rdquo; to which Deputy Rabbitte referred. The &ldquo;discreet charge&rdquo; to which he referred involves slipping a few pounds to someone in order to gain entry to a place. Such charges were levied on those who wanted to gain entry to a speakeasy in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the dictionary, the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo;, as used in section 94(2), means &ldquo;separate and distinct&rdquo;. However, the amendment proposes that this be replaced with the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;distinguished from others of its kind&rdquo;. Therefore, section 94(2) will now read &ldquo;where there is a charge distinguished from others of its kind&rdquo;. Does this mean that an hotelier, for example, could be informed that he or she must pay copyright fees in respect of music being played on their premises if a &ldquo;special charge dis<Col N="1472" /> tinguished from others of its kind&rdquo; is being levied on people listening to that music?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State received legal advice in respect of this matter? Given that the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; is defined in the <i>Collins' Pocket English Dictionary &ndash; Colour Edition</i>, as meaning &ldquo;special and distinct&rdquo;, it appears it would be better to use it in the section than the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;.</P>

I do not recall in detail the Committee Stage debate on this matter but concerns were expressed about the possible connotations which might attach to the word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo;. Deputy Owen has now provided us with a definition of discrete as meaning &ldquo;separate and distinct&rdquo;.

      <P>In page 61, line 31, to delete &ldquo;or are otherwise&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and are solely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Concerns were expressed to us about the use of the term &ldquo;or are otherwise&rdquo; because people believed it was too vague. It was suggested that the section should read &ldquo;and are solely concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare&rdquo;. Clubs, societies and other organisations are granted exemptions provided they are concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare. In my opinion the term &ldquo;or are otherwise&rdquo; is not specific enough and replacing it with the phrase &ldquo;and are solely&rdquo; means that clubs, societies and other organisations to which the section refers must be concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare. Will the Minister of State indicate his views on this matter?</P>

      <P>This amendment follows on our Committee Stage discussions. My position on the amendment is that it would impose an exclusive requirement that beneficiaries under the clubs and societies exception be conducted solely for the advancement of religion, education or social welfare, in addition to being charitable in their main objectives. In view of the complex legal meaning attaching to the concept of what is charitable, such a change would make this exception too complex and inflexible to work. The somewhat more flexible formulation incorporated in the present text is preferable and should be retained. Accordingly, I would prefer not to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I hope not to have to commence this section at all if I receive sufficient undertakings from PPI Limited, which represents sound recordings proprietors, that it will refrain from pursuing royalty payments from genuine non-commercial clubs and societies which are the intended beneficiaries of this exception. My Department is in correspondence with PPI and IMRO in regard to the playing of music at genuine non-commercial school concerts and similar school events. While the pressure of work on this Bill has not permitted my Department to finalise this correspondence, the present indications are that both organisations are strongly sympathetic to my objective of lifting the burden of paying royalties from the playing of music and sound recordings in genuine non-commercial cases by an informal route. That was the committee's wish and I am confident of a positive outcome to the correspondence with both collecting societies in the near future. I hope our objectives on this important issue can be realised.</P>

      <P>There is a concern that some clubs and societies might exploit this exception. I am aware that the phrase &ldquo;and is not established or conducted for profit&rdquo; is included in the text. Some societies run events to raise money and make profits which are used to provide changing room facilities for young people, club houses etc. but such profits could also be used to build an establishment which could become a full-time bar which could take business away from an adjacent bar which pays rates and copyright fees.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to proceed cautiously here. I do not want clubs and societies to be exploited in any way by the PPIs of this world but, equally, I do not want people who are entitled to copyright payments, such as poor artists, to be denied copyright payments by clubs which could exploit this exception.</P>

If someone were to establish the &ldquo;Tom Kitt Church of Copyright&rdquo; to spread the religion of copyright across the world, he or she could argue that the church was set up for religious purposes and that people should pay money to join it. Does the use of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; mean that an organisation can be either charitable or religious? Some cults exist which are not very charitable and they are specifically set up to cater for the financial interests of the cult leader.</P>

      <P>Deputies Owen and Stanton proposed this amendment on Committee Stage because of their concern that the current wording of the section restricts the benefit of the copying exception to broadcasters who copy using their own facilities and, as such, excludes broadcasters such as TG4 which contract out such work. The Deputies also pointed out that the equivalent provision in the UK, section 86 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, provides that broadcasters can copy or authorise copying for the purpose of their broadcasts but does not state that the broadcasting organisation must use its own facilities.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns raised by the Deputies but, having raised the matter with the Attorney General, I have been advised that this amendment would go further than what is permitted by EU international law, namely, the Rome Convention, or the EU Directive on rental and lending and should, therefore, be opposed.

      <P>In page 62, line 7, to delete &ldquo;6&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputies Owen and Stanton suggested an amendment to the effect that any copies made by broadcasting organisations or cable programme service providers, by means of their own facilities and for the purposes of their own broadcasts or cable programmes, should be destroyed within 28 days of first being used for broadcasting or being included in a cable programme service rather than the six months provided for in the Bill. I am aware this is the practice in some European countries and in the UK. However, a similar provision already exists in section 12(7) and (8) of the Copyright Act, 1963, although that Act referred only to RTE and its broadcasts. A time limit of six months was provided for in the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>Having considered this matter further and while appreciating the rights of rightsholders, I am of the opinion that the reduction of the time limit to 28 days would result in a radical undermining of this exception which is currently enjoyed by broadcasting organisations. However, in a spirit of compromise, I am proposing a time limit of three months in an effort to bridge the gap.</P>

      <P>This may appear to be no more than a drafting amendment but it would change the meaning of the section which deals with video recording of television programmes.

      <P>Only a very limited use is allowed. If the Minister is serious in making that intervention he should change the wording of the section from &ldquo;private and domestic use&rdquo; to &ldquo;private or domestic use&rdquo;. The imposition of the requirement that recordings be for private and domestic use is an entirely unnecessary constraint. I may want a recording of a programme for my private viewing but it may not be possible to meet the second part of the requirement and <i>vice versa</i>. Compliance with this sort of prescriptive detail before one can record a programme for one's private use is an unreasonable intrusion into the way we live now. If one cannot see one of the matches in the European football contest, one must now be careful in what circumstances one causes it to be recorded and subsequently viewed.</P>
      <P>The Bill places a heavy emphasis on the rights of owners of copyright. My amendment seeks a modest concession to the societal consequences of what we are doing. Whatever advice the Minister is being given, I ask him to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment. How can this section be policed? It will be of interest to Members whose children can tape anything they wish at the touch of a button. When this Bill becomes law, if their children make, for private but not domestic use, a fixation of a broadcast or cable programme solely for the purpose of enabling it to be viewed or listened to at another time or place they will break to the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It conjures up the vision of a great many 12 and 13 year olds who are fixating &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;, one of my favourite programmes, on their videos but who perhaps are doing so for domestic use but not for private use. They might be doing it so that they can show it to their friends. Is that still <Col N="1477" /> a domestic use or once the friends come and watch it, does it cease to be a private use?</P>
    <P>That is the difficulty with the term &ldquo;and&rdquo; in this section. It has to be &ldquo;or&rdquo;, otherwise one will have the nonsense, perhaps, of that van going around with the detector swinging around on its roof, identifying where the televisions are, then trying to find some way of identifying where the videos are, pouncing on a house and grabbing a load of videos. There will be many houses where they will find those videos, all of them decent with nothing naughty I hope, but they will pounce on them and then they will find they have been used for reasons other than domestic and private together. It is a very small word to change, although a little word can mean a great deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's second amendment concerns doing this solely for the purpose of enabling it to be viewed or listened to at another time or place. Again, how does one police that? That is <i>ad infinitum</i>, one could keep it then forever. I do not think there is any time constraint on it. It strikes me that this is a real intrusion into people's homes and it is not policeable. We have heard the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment saying she will take eight or nine gardaí and set them up in the company law enforcement agency. We have not been able to convince her to get the Garda Commissioner to assign a number of gardaí to help with the Competition Authority where they really are needed. We would have to ask the Garda Commissioner to have some video policing gardaí. I can envisage them now with their visors and their special uniforms as they come roaring around the housing estates of Dublin and elsewhere, looking for timeshifters who have been taping videos, perhaps solely for private use or solely for domestic use but not for private and domestic. I ask the Minister of State to take a risk and go for this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will concede that I have accepted some of the amendments today and on Committee Stage. I assure the House and the public at large that there is no problem with people recording their favourite programme or whatever, the obvious example being &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, and viewing it at another time, in other words practising time-fixing. That is what we are trying to achieve. On the use of the term &ldquo;private and domestic&rdquo;, it is common copyright terminology to describe private personal copying. Having listened to the Deputies today and to the Committee, I would like to try to obtain a better definition but when one introduces the term &ldquo;or&rdquo;, one is making, as the Deputy said herself, quite a sizeable change and then that allows effectively for private copying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem there from the rights owner's point of view is that one is then entering a new area. For example, at the other extreme of the <Col N="1478" /> argument where an individual would record a particular programme &ndash; let us get away from the term &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; and use up to date language &ndash; and then go on a lecture tour or address seminars using that programme&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be private use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that person should be paying royalties to the rights owners because he is using it for commercial use. If Deputy Nora Owen produced a documentary or gave a lecture which was on television in relation to copyright law, for example and someone else used that material, it would be wrong. I would be glad to accept this amendment but my problem in doing so is that effectively it could allow for that situation because it would involve a person recording something privately but who could use it for commercial benefit. Therein lies the difficulty.</P>
      <P>I accept that there may be better language available. I give the Deputy one commitment. I know there will be an amendment to this Bill and it might take some time but I or whichever Minister is in this Department at that time will ask the officials to examine it during that period. We have consulted with the Attorney General on the terminology that Deputy Rabbitte suggests. Using the term &ldquo;or&rdquo; would give too much latitude to this section.</P>
      <P>We want to try to allow for the person to personally copy something for private use. The term &ldquo;private and domestic use&rdquo; is used in copyright law. Deputy Rabbitte referred to a nursing home situation or a private hospital. All of those situations are covered by this legislation. There is no question of creating any police force for this purpose because we do not deal with legislation in this way. We deal with it from the other end and I mentioned the example of a person privately recording something and using it commercially. As the Deputies know, the legislation is geared towards that person paying royalties to the rights owners. That is the way in which this law is placed. We are not interested in knocking on the doors of people's homes as they press the video button. It is ludicrous to suggest that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is the term &ldquo;and domestic&rdquo; and again using Deputy Owen's dictionary, domestic means &ldquo;of the home or family&rdquo;. The Minister is saying that this is restricting the making of fixations to be used in the home or family. If somebody wants to record a programme in their office while they are at a meeting in order to view it when they return to their office later, it does not involve a domestic situation. This is the problem with the term &ldquo;private and domestic&rdquo;. It is not possible now for people to record programmes in their offices while they are at meetings.</P>

      <P>This is just one example. The Minister put forward the example of people who make recordings and then go on tour. We are proposing that the making for private or domestic use is covered anyway. That does not arise, it is a spurious argument. I suggest that by not allowing this amendment, the Minister is really restricting this to the family home as the term &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; clearly involves the home and the family. That is the only place one can record for private use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Acting Chairperson, I will clarify that because Deputy Rabbitte referred to an office situation involving a Deputy or any member of the public recording a programme. There is no question of that person breaking the law. I appreciate the Deputy's point about the term &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; and I have acknowledged that there may be better language available but I suggest that we do not go as far as using the term &ldquo;private or domestic&rdquo;, because then we will encounter some trouble as this will progress the matter into a potentially commercial area. However, I repeat what I said, that when amending the Bill at some future stage, I will ask those who have drafted it to examine it again. I give that assurance to the Deputies because anybody recording in an office situation in the context of a private, personal copy is very much protected in this legislation and that is my advice.</P>
      <P>We cannot go down the route of allowing private copying and the Attorney General's advice is along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>People may be reassured by the Minister of State's remarks and I acknowledge the spirit in which they are made, but he knows that they do not carry weight. In the event of his provision ever being challenged it would be of almost no significance to say that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, assured us in June 2000 that this was not intended. The section will be interpreted by the courts and what was in the mind of the Minister of State will be of peripheral significance.</P>
      <P>This legislation has been in gestation for years. As a result the Minister of State and, more particularly, his officials have been immersed in every detail of it until they must be sick to their teeth of it and are becoming more intolerant of those of us, who have happily long forgotten its detail, continuing to raise questions which they have disposed of a long time ago. However, unfortunately, it is an issue of concern in the community, even though it does not know we are enacting this legislation. That is the way we live and people use these fixations as a part of everyday life. I cannot understand why every time a judgment call has had to be made in terms of the rights holders and their interests and the public good and society, the Minister of State has invariably come down on the side of the rights holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, John Cleese has acquired a reputation in Britain apparently as a business consultant making videos relating to some aspect of <Col N="1480" /> communications and so on. Does the Minister of State suggest if I go home and record the John Cleese programme for private use that I could go around the country peddling it? His officials may think I might be better watching &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo;, but anybody who is minded to record programmes can do so anyway. That is straightforward piracy. &ldquo;Private&rdquo; has meaning. Deputy Stanton provided the dictionary definition of &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; which is its clear use but &ldquo;private&rdquo; does not mean recording something and peddling it for commercial advantage. I do not understand how one is exposed to that. Instead, restrictive phraseology, &ldquo;private and domestic&rdquo;, is used. The Minister of State seems to suggest that if I want to record the news in my office because I am in the House, my office is regarded as a &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; setting.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point but one of these days the Minister of State should take a risk and come down on the side of the hoi-polloi and see if the sky falls. I do not think it will. Such a good job has been done by him and his officials in policing the interests of the rights holders in this legislation that it is no wonder we are heading towards a monopoly where Mr. Gates will control the world. There is also a public interest dimension to this argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; is &ldquo;for the use of one person or a group only, personal, unconnected with one's work&rdquo;. The Minister of State has given verbal assurances that this will not prevent people from recording programmes in their offices but I challenge him to put his money where his mouth is and include the wording in the legislation. The section includes the wording &ldquo;the making for private and domestic use&rdquo;. Domestic refers to the home and families, not offices or statements in the House. If this phraseology is not amended, it will mean that private recording will not be allowed because it is not a domestic setting. The word &ldquo;private&rdquo; refers to something which is unconnected with one's work, is not commercial and is for the use of an individual or a small group of individuals. The Minister might examine it again.</P>

      <P>Before the break I was setting out the reasons for the exclusion of family members as stated in amendment No. 72. In keeping with the approach I have adopted on this matter, I also seek the insertion of the words &ldquo;for reward&rdquo; in amendment No. 73 because that is the sense of it. It is obvious that the sale, rental, lending or offering for sale of a fixation to members of the public would be for reward. One would find it difficult to understand how a person would engage in pirating a fixation and then go out of his or her way to give it away to members of the public.</P>
      <P>In the interests of clarity, amendment No. 73, which seeks the insertion of the words &ldquo;for reward&rdquo;, should be accepted by the Minister. This would make it clear, if a copy is ultimately deemed to be an infringing copy for these purposes, that it was made for reward and was being exploited for commercial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with amendment No. 72. This matter arose on Committee Stage when there was a discussion about what it means to loan a fixation, tape or copy to another person. We were anxious to exclude lending tapes to a person, family member or friend for private and domestic purposes.</P>
      <P>However, I am less inclined to agree with amendment No. 73 because there is a possibility that infringing copies could be made available to the public for free. The effect of that might be to, in some cases, flood the market with infringing copies. A person who is well off could do that and the rightsholder's copies would be left on the shelf. They would not be purchased. The words &ldquo;for reward&rdquo; are not necessary because a person's commercial interests could be damaged by below cost selling or something being given away. This would have an even more damaging effect than selling it. However, I agree with the proposal in amendment No. 72 and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

There is merit in both arguments but in respect of amendment No. 72, it is necessary for the situation to be explicit in relation to family members and friends. We all engage in that practice and we should not be liable to prosecution for infringing copyright because of something that is now habitual and practised every day within the narrow meaning of the phrase in parenthesis.</P>

    <P>During Committee Stage Deputies Owen and Stanton suggested an amendment to section 107 regarding exceptions to integrity rights. This would have included a provision whereby the integrity right would not be infringed by anything done for the purposes of avoiding interference with constitutional rights or avoiding an action in common law. The Deputies considered that this amendment was necessary to ensure broadcasters could make changes to copyright works in such <Col N="1484" /> circumstances without infringing the integrity right.</P>
    <P>At that time I considered the amendment would create a sweeping exception and would be vague in comparison to the specific scope of the paragraph as it stands. However, I agreed to give it further consideration. Since then, I sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General which shared my concerns and agreed that the proposed amendment was too vague. However, the office suggested an alternative wording which forms the basis of my amendment and which should address the concerns raised by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 76:</P>
      <P>In page 72, to delete lines 32 to 40.</P>
      <P>Section 124 deals with the situation where a copyright owner, when an action has been infringed, may take action as appropriate and is entitled to the usual relief in damages, etc. The relevant person is entitled to the same rights that apply to the infringement of any other property right.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I have with it relates to subsection (3) where such an action for infringement gets under way and the defendant does not admit the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright. As I understand it, the court is satisfied to take evidence on the basis of an affidavit. That is a departure from normal procedure where the person asserting that claim would have to defend it under cross-examination in court. We are shifting the burden of proof. There could be a vast amount of money involved in such a case. I query the wisdom of taking evidence on affidavit alone.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 74 the Minister seeks to broaden it from any contravention of criminal law to &ldquo;any contravention of civil or criminal law&rdquo;. Litigants in other walks of life would give a lot to broaden it in that fashion. I query whether the person asserting the ownership should not also be required to defend it in the normal way and subject himself or herself to cross-examination.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I advised Deputies that section 124 as currently drafted explicitly provides that cross-examination will be allowed where a reasonable <i>prima facie</i> response to a plaintiff's claim of copyright is made. As the text of subsection (3) states, the court may order <Col N="1485" /> that oral evidence be adduced if it is satisfied that &ldquo;any conflict of evidence between the affidavits may not be resolved other than by hearing oral testimony&rdquo;. However, as a result of the Deputy's concerns, I consulted the Attorney General's office and it advises that apart from the provision in the text, Order 40, Rule 1 of the rules of the Superior Courts clearly states that the court may, on the application of either party, order cross-examination on affidavit accordingly. While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, I consider these amendments unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We expressed concern about this issue on Committee Stage. Our amendment seeks to cross-examine the person giving evidence. Section 136 creates a presumption of ownership without proof. There should be the possibility in any court case of cross-examining the person giving evidence. The Minister of State did not convince me on Committee Stage that it was not necessary to include this provision. Section 124(3) states that &ldquo;evidence in relation to ownership of the copyright be given on affidavit and the court may decide the issue having considered any affidavit presented to it unless it is satisfied that any conflict of evidence between the affidavits may not be resolved other than by hearing oral testimony in which case the court may order that oral evidence may be adduced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the court decides there is a conflict, it will allow oral evidence but not cross-examination. However, oral evidence does not have the same meaning as cross-examination. Did the Minister of State have an opportunity to talk to the Attorney General about the points we made on Committee Stage on including this necessary safeguard? Many of the companies which will have to implement this legislation are extremely cross about section 136. Section 124 indicates how a court case will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State said that courts may order oral evidence if they so wish. Section 124(3) states, &ldquo;.unless it is satisfied that any conflict of evidence between the affidavits may not be resolved other than by hearing oral testimony in which case the court may order that oral evidence may be adduced&rdquo;. The Minister told us our amendment is superfluous, yet he has included a similar phrase. If the Minister can include it, why can we not do so when it has the same effect? We are hinting to the courts that the Legislature would be happy to see cross-examination. We want to include this in the Bill. I do not understand how it could do any harm.</P>

I consulted the Attorney General and he reminded me that, apart from the soundness of this section, Order 40, Rule 1 of the Superior Courts states that the courts may, on the application of either party, order cross-examination on affidavit. I recall we had lengthy discussions on the issue of presump<Col N="1486" /> tion on Committee Stage. I would like to have the opportunity to clarify that. This is central to our discussions. The advice I have is that the section is appropriate. The amendments are, therefore, unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unsatisfactory situation in the sense that the Minister is saying he has been advised by the Attorney General's office this is the way it is. I am wary of legislation where we are generous to copyright owners in protecting their property rights. Depending on one's point of view, we will either go too far or just far enough, if one is the Minister. As regards the remedies being offered to copyright owners to assert these entitlements, in what other walks of life do we change the evidentiary rules to facilitate an owner of property to assert his or her rights and entitlements? We do not do that in too many cases.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Owen said, if a person says he or she owns my farm, that will be the case until it is proven to the contrary. That situation would not be tolerated for long in rural Ireland. However, it is suggested it should be tolerated here. The least that is required in that situation is that the person so asserting should be subjected to cross-examination in the normal way. I am a little uneasy about this. There are a few areas where we are shifting the burden of proof and it is of concern. The next amendment, which is not yet before us, relates to subsection (4) where we are making hearsay evidence admissible. That is quite a change from any laws of evidence I half learned many years ago.</P>

      <P>I accept we are introducing a new element into law but, as I said on Committee Stage &ndash; we will deal with this when we come to section 136 in relation to presumptions &ndash; I consider it necessary in the context of the way events have been happening in the whole area of copyright. We are strengthening the law. Deputy Rabbitte said that, overall, we are favouring rightsowners. That would be appropriate for us as legislators introducing copyright law but this section deals with the position of the defendant, not the plaintiff. This is about trial management and I am satisfied from my consultations, especially those with the Attorney General, that the law is sound. We will deal with presumptions later in the debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> This is more of the same. This simply states that hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purposes of any hearing under subsection (3). It is very unusual that hearsay evidence in this fashion is admissible. Most of us in recent years have become aware of <i>In re. Haughey</i> and the groundwork it has laid down in this area in terms of constitutional rights. That is probably not very different from Article 6 of the European convention which protects the same rights. It is very unusual. In what other area of law can hearsay evidence be accepted for the purposes set out in subsection (3)? The very notion that hearsay evidence can be used for the purposes of the affidavit and is dependent on the court ordering that one be subject to cross-examination is fraught, and I am unhappy with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with it also. We have discussed at length the complete shift in this legislation where, for the first time ever, a person will be guilty until proven innocent as opposed to being innocent until proven guilty. A copyright owner is presumed to own the copyright under section 136 in this amended Bill, and all he or she has to do is use hearsay evidence which can be accepted for the purposes of a hearing under subsection (3). I know that hearsay evidence is a terminology used in the courts but in most cases hearsay evidence cannot be used to support a person's claim to copyright. If it said that hearsay evidence may be given for the purposes of any hearing but it must be supported by other substantial evidence before it can be used, that might be acceptable, but it does not state it has to be supported with anything else. Conceivably a judge could listen to this hearsay evidence and make a decision based on hearsay evidence only. I realise this is not a justice Bill but that is my fear. I hope the Minister has taken advice on this matter from the Attorney General and that he will read it into the record to satisfy us.</P>

      <P>I recall this debate on Committee Stage and I was anxious to have the matter examined again to see if it was necessary or desirable to delete the subsection which explicitly allows the courts to accept hearsay evidence in civil hearings for breach of copyright. I have consulted the Office of the Attorney General and it has informed me that explicit exceptions to the rule against hearsay of the type we have here are not contrary to proper legal principles. I am informed they do little more than reflect the broad practice of the courts in civil cases where hearsay evidence often will be admitted but only subject to the strict evaluation of the court as to its value as proof. I am further advised that securing this exception to the rule is in the interests of flexibility and efficiency in the conduct of civil trials for breach of copyright. While considering it a policy matter, the Office of the Attorney General would prefer to see the subsection retained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the circumstances where application may be made to the District Court and where seizure of the alleged infringing copies may take place. In subsection (4), the normal procedures are departed from where a witness or the deponent shall not be obliged to indicate the source of the information upon which that witness formed the belief that material may be found in a particular location. I would rather that the Minister would explain to us why, in this particular area of pirating copies of material that could be encompassed by this section, the practices are such that it is necessary to insert a section like that where the deponent is not obliged to indicate the source of his or her information. That is an unusual leniency that one would not get in other <Col N="1489" /> areas of the law. Perhaps the Minister would set out his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that. I recall the Deputy making the case in other legislation in regard to the whistleblowers' charter, although that was a different situation. The Deputy wanted to delete subsection (4). I pointed out on Committee Stage that there may be some misunderstanding as to the purpose of this subsection. It is a strictly limited witness protection measure. The idea is to protect the identity of persons such as employees who might bring evidence to a rightsholder or his or her representatives of an infringement of copyright. Where the rightsholder acquires a search warrant to secure evidence of this infringement, section 129(4) would allow the rightsholder to swear an affidavit indicating his or her belief that infringing material was present on particular premises based on the evidence of the informant without revealing the name of that informant. It is very much in line with the Deputy's thinking on another area.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that such a provision is particularly important to allow rightsholders to obtain search warrants against companies indulging in, for example, software infringement where employees would be subject to a legitimate fear of dismissal should they do their public duty in the fight against copyright infringement. That is the reason behind this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>It is not remarkable that this type of provision surfaces for the first time in this Bill. The country is awash with all kinds of scandals, big or small depending on one's point of view and, in most case, they are not suffering from an absence of exaggeration, but nonetheless they are serious matters.</P>
      <P>Protection for the whistleblower is introduced in this Bill. If there is not a statue erected to the Minister of State in digital form on the top of Liberty Hall, where we can all see it, by the rightsholders after the enactment of this Bill, he is getting less than his due. The Government did not introduce such protection for the Revenue Commissioners. Tens of thousands of employees throughout the country have known there has been major tax evasion for the past 25 years but did successive Governments introduce such a measure to protect an accountancy clerk in an office to enable him or her to come forward and reveal the Exchequer was being cheated of X hundred thousand pounds? They did not, but the Government will introduce such protection for the people who are being so expertly represented here by the rightsholders societies. I do not know what type of society we will become. There seems to be many areas of law where this type of protection ought to be afforded that is not afforded, yet it can be introduced in this area.</P>

The requirement that registration is compulsory will tidy up the legislation and, hopefully, there will be fewer reasons to resort to the courts.</P>

If one told people in any other section of civil society that as long as a man in a smart suit comes along and asserts ownership of a person's car, land or site on which to build a house, that man would probably suffer personal injury, not to mention facilitating his claim in court on the basis of a presumption that he is the owner of what he says he is. I do not know what the effect of this section will be in practice. I do not know if the Minster of State knows. It is a deviation from the normal rules of evidence. Normally one is required to come to court to prove one's case. In this case, there is a presumption that one is who one says one is and one owns what one says one owns, and the contrary must be proved. That is an extraordinary change. Maybe there are characteristics of this industry that make this necessary, but on Committee Stage the Minister of State failed to persuade me that was the case.</P>

      <P>We had major reservations about this matter, as the Minister is aware, and it appeared in the 1998 Act as well. At the time we talked about competition but we let it through because there was an international difficulty. As presented initially it was a major change in thinking and in law and it caused much panic among certain people. As a result of the Committee Stage and Seanad debates he has put certain safeguards in the last part we discussed about the affidavits. Another issue is pertinent here. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned lobbyists and so on. The Minister and his Department have a fantastic staff, a matter to which we alluded earlier, and officials who are working hard on this but obviously they need more assistance. I urge the Minister to seek that assistance because this is an important technical area. When the Minister is in Opposition and on this side he will have no back-up.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to make the point that the Opposition's role in legislation such as this is not political; it is to offer an alternative view and to tease out the debate. Unlike other parliaments, in this Parliament the Opposition has no back-up service. This is getting away from the debate but it is pertinent because this is a major change. We are depending on lobbyists to advise us but that is not the way it should be. The parliament should be independent of that. As parliamentarians we should have access to our own independent advice but we have not got it. I advise the Minister to prepare the way for himself when he is on this side and to put in a good word to the Minister for Finance. We had reservations but many of them have been allayed. We hope this will go through and that it will work. We will keep our fingers crossed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give an assurance that we are doing the right thing. Some of what I have to say may be going back over old ground but it is important to put it on the record. During Committee Stage I outlined that the presumptions contained in section 136 included rebuttable presumptions of the subsistence of copyright in a work and of ownership of copyright in favour of the plaintiffs in copyright actions, whether civil or criminal. These presumptions are, in fact, already in force for civil actions for breach of copyright under the provisions of the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, which passed through the House with some speed. The <Col N="1493" /> Deputy's amendment would delete the second of these rebuttal presumptions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will understand that I did not include this section in the Bill lightly since it involves a significant shift in the evidentiary burden in copyright actions onto the defendant. There is no doubt about that. However, this was done for very pressing reasons. The position under the Copyright Act, 1963, was that in order to defend a copyright action, a defendant needed to do no more than deny, point blank, the points of claim made against them. I do not know whether I said in the House before that it reminds me of the general who just stared at the wall and denied or whatever. Maybe that is a dramatic comparison. Given the facts I have heard in regard to the background to this matter, the position of the defendant was an important matter we had to deal with. This approach &ndash; that of putting the plaintiff or prosecution on proof of the detailed points of their claim &ndash; is the usual one in many classes of action as pointed out by Deputy Rabbitte. In the case of copyright, however, it can cause particular difficulties. These occur principally where the protected material that is the subject of the case is the product of an international copyright industry, such as computer software or music recording. Under the Copyright Act, 1963, plaintiffs in such actions could be faced by defendants with blank denials of such basic matters as the subsistence of copyright in a modern song and of the plaintiff's ownership of the material, without the need to show any basis for these denials whatsoever. While we are shifting power in the plaintiff's direction, clearly there was a deficiency in that area.</P>
      <P>In view of the complex chains of ownership which often characterise the intellectual property of the international copyright industries, this in itself can be a substantial barrier to rightsholders considering legal action to protect their rights. The position is made even more burdensome to rightsholders by a finding of the Supreme Court &ndash; the case of PPI <i>v </i>Cody &ndash; in which the court effectively held that affidavit evidence alone would not be sufficient to overturn denials of this sort, however unreasonable; that the deponents of the affidavits would have to be available to be cross-examined directly in the courts on the content of their affidavits. This presents holders of complex, international copyright interests with a situation in which they would need to marshall witnesses, in some cases, from a number of countries at very great difficulty and expense in order to overcome even the most transparently baseless denial of, for example, the subsistence of copyright in a song. Deputies will appreciate that this situation represented a very substantial barrier to justice for some rightsholders and, as such, it amounted to a serious breach of Ireland's obligations under the TRIPs Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that the section 136 presumptions represent a shift in aspects of the burden to adduce evidence only rather than a shift in the burden of proof, and that the pre<Col N="1494" /> sumptions will be rebuttable. It will still be necessary for plaintiffs and prosecutors to prove their case. All that the section will really require of plaintiffs is that if, for example, they wish to deny that a particular plaintiff owns a particular copyright, they will have to produce some reasonable argument or <i>prime facie</i> evidence to support this denial. This would then be considered by the court and, where the court considered that a reasonable denial had been made, the matter would then be tried in the normal way, with full examination of witnesses, giving the defendant every opportunity to rebut the presumptions included in section 136 in favour of the plaintiff. With these points in view, the legal and constitutional aspects of this section have been carefully considered by my Department and by the Office of the Attorney General. That office has advised that these presumptions are legally and constitutionally sound.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputies expressed serious concern that the enactment of the section 136 presumptions, taken in the overall context of the Bill, could disturb the balance between the interests of copyright rightsholders and those of commercial users of copyright material in particular to the unfair disadvantage of users. I recall the clear suggestion that Members of the committee would have been happier if the overall balance were further adjusted in the interest of the user in particular through subjecting copyright collecting societies to a requirement of compulsory registration. We will shortly come to Government amendments which respond to the concerns of the committee on this point. That is an important relative connected point.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in one of the more sensitive areas of the relation between copyright proprietors and commercial users &ndash; that of sound recordings &ndash; a scheme of licensing of right, carefully devised, to safeguard the proper interest of both parties will be enacted by the new section 38, introduced by amendment 16<i>b</i>. In all the circumstances Deputies will agree that the Government has been able to go a long way towards meeting the concerns as to the effects of section 136 presumptions on the overall balance of the Bill. In this connection I thank Members for their contributions.</P>
    <P>The importance of the international copyright industries to Ireland's modern economy is very great. These industries would continue to face serious difficulties in obtaining effective access to justice if this amendment were to remove the rebuttable presumption in favour of their ownership of disputed material contained in section 136(3). In view of this &ndash; I appreciate it has been a long explanation &ndash; I ask Deputies to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is a weighty repost from the Minister. I would have been far more comfortable if we had been able to take evidence to this effect on Committee Stage. Our beloved and esteemed Chairman is in the <Col N="1495" /> Chamber and I would say to him in public what I said to him in private, that lining up the various interest groups for eight hours on a single day is not the ideal way to take submissions on complex legislation. It is one of the great prerogatives of chairmen that they do not have to struggle with it line by line afterwards. The Minister said the presumptions in this case are rebuttable and that is important in law. However, adducing one case is not necessarily conclusive. There might be any set of circumstances in that case about which we do not know. We heard the rightsholder's side of the story. I heard the same arguments that the Minister has now put on record and if they are true, they must be addressed.</P>
      <P>However, I would have been more comfortable if we could have managed our affairs in such a fashion that the alternative point of view, if there is one, might be heard. These are far reaching and draconian measures compared with anything else, aside from the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation, in our legal code and I would like to have had the opportunity to weigh up the evidence for myself on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another caveat. The Minister said the defendants will have the opportunity to bring forward evidence and so forth to defend themselves against the presumptions. It might be difficult for some defendants to do that. The defendant might be the owner of a small pub in a rural area who is battling against an international organisation with almost limitless resources. That is the David and Goliath difficulty in that regard.</P>
      <P>Compulsory registration will remove the danger of cowboy operators moving into the system. The rightsholders will be represented by reputable people and organisations. The controller's role has also been strengthened. As a result of the work on Committee Stage, much has been done to allay people's fears. However, what type of evidence would the defendants be expected to produce to defend their claim to be the music owners? What would be required for them to go to the next stage of a hearing or court case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this on Committee Stage and the situation where there is no copyright in a song, for example, an Irish traditional song. They could also argue that somebody else owned the rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the seriousness of this change. Deputy Rabbitte held my office in the past and he will be aware that one must look at the evidence and facts available and take advice from the Attorney General, who tells me this provision is constitutionally sound. I was particularly swayed by the case where a defendant simply makes a point blank denial and repeats it. Rightsholders would have to bring witnesses from all over the world. If a song was produced and recorded in Nashville, for example, one might have to bring the engineers and everybody who was present when the <Col N="1496" /> CD or record was being compiled. There were important facts to indicate that this issue had to be addressed, although I accept that it is a major shift.</P>
    <P>We are introducing compulsory registration which has regularly been advocated in this House. There is also the new section 38 inserted by amendment No. 16f2&gt;b. I accept that we are making a major shift but it is necessary on the basis of the facts and evidence available to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 84:</P>
      <P>In page 80, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this section &lsquo;loan' means a loan for reward and in particular does not include a loan to a family member or friend for private and domestic use, and &lsquo;lends' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the offences section of the Bill, section 137. A person may be guilty of an offence if he does what is in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), all of which have a commercial purpose. This is the distinction I am seeking to make in the amendment. The phrases &ldquo;make for sale, rental or loan&rdquo;, &ldquo;sells, rents or lends&rdquo;, &ldquo;imports into the State&rdquo; and so forth have a commercial business focus. I am seeking to deal with circumstances where the loan might be made without reward to a friend or member of the family. The amendment reads, &ldquo;In this section &lsquo;loan' means a loan for reward and in particular does not include a loan to a family member or friend for private and domestic use, and &lsquo;lends' shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the section stands, a person can be guilty of committing the criminal offence of infringing copyright in the manner envisaged in the section, which is designed for a commercial situation, because the section does not encompass circumstances where one can do it for entirely harmless reasons to a family friend or member of the family. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The legal position was that the definition of lending in section 41(2)(b), which clearly refers to lending &ldquo;through an establishment to which members of the public have access&rdquo;, would exclude this type of private lending.

      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputies pointed out that the Bill did not deal with a situation where a false claim is asserted in respect of copyright and the legislation should deal with a person who asserts such a claim for financial gain, knowing it to be false. The office of the Attorney General had advised that such a situation is already encompassed by section 137. I subsequently wrote to that office to emphasise the concerns raised by Deputies and the office replied that the situation is largely covered by section 137 but the proposed amendment might catch a number of factual situations which section 137 would not.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am proposing amendment No. 85 which inserts a new section in the copyright and performance Part of the Bill. However, the penalties have been amended to coincide with those contained in sections 137 and 252. Whereas I have not gone as far as Deputy Rabbitte, I hope I am moving in the right direction.</P>

    <P>I am not sure where I stand in relation to amendment No. 138<i>a</i> and the discussion we have just had. It seems to me that the licensing body means not just a society or organisation as stipulated but one which has been registered as such under the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another important aspect of the legislation which has been debated at length. In the interests of clarity, I will be moving amendments 98<i>a</i>, 135<i>a</i> and 138<i>a</i>. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 89, 90 and 91.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the question of compulsory registration of licensing bodies in the context of the presumptions under section 136. This was one of the most serious policy issues to arise in the course of debate on the Bill in the select committee. The present text of the Bill would provide the facility for collecting societies formed to effect collective management on behalf of rightsholders in the copyright, performers and database fields to register with the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks on a voluntary basis. These provisions were included in the interests of promoting transparency in the activities of these organisations. My Department's contacts with the societies suggested that they appreciated the purpose of this initiative and that it was probable that all four of the collecting societies currently operating in the copyright area in Ireland would, in fact, have registered on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>I was, however, impressed by arguments made by members of the select committee as to the desirability of making the registration provisions compulsory in order to ensure that the interests and operations of collecting societies would be laid open to public view through a public register. I also took note of indications from the collecting societies that they might prefer compulsory registration, because it would create a more certain environment for their operation. Finally, the introduction of the new section 38 by amendment 16<i>b</i> effectively requires that PPI Limited be registered compulsorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these points in mind and since I preferred to see all collecting societies treated equally as far as registration requirements are concerned, I directed the Department to approach the Office of the Attorney General again for further consultations in relation to its advice that authors' rights societies such as the Irish Music Rights Organisation could not be registered compulsorily under the terms of the Berne Convention. Following correspondence and discussions, I am happy to say that the office now feels able to take a broader view of the situation and has revised its advice. The advice is that the office does not believe there is any legal impediment to adopting compulsory licensing on the basis that it seems improbable that collecting societies were contem<Col N="1500" /> plated in the drafting of Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the representations which he has received in the matter, and supported by the revised advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I have now decided that registration, subject to the conditions of registration already specified in the Bill, should be made compulsory in respect of all collecting societies operating under Parts II, III and V. This requirement will be supported by suitable criminal sanction in the event of non-compliance. This is the effect of Government amendments 98<i>a</i>, 135<i>a</i> and 138<i>a</i>.</P>
    <P>As regards the conditions attaching to registration, I gave consideration to adding to the conditions of registration along the lines suggested in amendment 91. My conclusion was that the conditions outlined in the Bill as they stand would be unduly burdensome, not only to the collecting societies but also in some cases to the registration authority which, at least for the time being, is to be the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks. The present scheme, in combination with the general schemes of reference of licensing schemes to the controller and the supervisory function of the Competition Authority, will secure a high degree of transparency and public accountability in the operation of collecting societies. I believe this is likely to prove sufficient. I stress that I share the concerns of Deputies that collecting societies operate in a manner fully consistent with the public interest while fulfilling their proper functions on behalf of their members. Accordingly, I will certainly keep the question of the conditions of registration of collecting societies under ongoing review and I will not hesitate to bring forward amending legislation in this area should that be required.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which the contributions of Members on all sides during the Committee Stage debate were of the greatest value in assisting me with the development of an important area of policy. I wish to convey my thanks to all the select committee members who contributed to the debate for their assistance in this difficult matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and thank the Minister of State for what he is doing with amendment No. 135<i>a</i>. This makes it compulsory to register as a licensing body. We pressed the Minister of State very hard on this issue on Committee Stage. I am glad to see a broader view has been taken following the advice of the Attorney General. It is particularly welcome in the absence of the Minister moving to a tribunal. He has not taken that idea on board and is leaving the adjudication in the hands of the controller but he has moved some way by bringing in assessors and limiting the time for an arbitrator to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registration of collecting societies is very important because in the past it was informal. Very few people knew of the 1963 Act &ndash; even those involved in sectors in which copyright was important. Unless there was a court case, no attention was paid to the Act. It was far too com<Col N="1501" /> plicated so people trusted their luck. Registering collection societies will make the business respectable. I am not saying the licensing bodies already in place are not respectable, but the danger is that they might become complacent and arrogant in an uncompetitive atmosphere. At present a person could set himself up as a licensing agent and exact money. Now people will have to have a certificate of registration on the wall and identification to show they are bone fide licensing agents. That is good for the industry.</P>
    <P>The music and literary industries are growing all the time. If people think there is money to be made, they will move into those areas. There was an article in a newspaper recently where a young man advocated people going into the patent industry because there was money to be made. He was not interested in the patents, he was interested in the financial cut and thrust of buying and selling patents.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister has been so sparing in the conditions laid down. He is not as punitive as we suggested he should be in amendment No. 91. Amendment No. 135 is light on detail but there is a stronger section later in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded that the conditions outlined in the Bill as they stand would be unduly burdensome. He added that in some cases the registration authority is to be &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; controller of patents, designs and trademarks. What does &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; mean? The note mentions additional resources for the controller who must deal with the legislation. The Minister says he cannot give the controller the additional resources he says he needs. It is like the sword of Damocles hanging over his head. If the registration authority was changed to become a tribunal, I would not object. Does the phrase &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; indicate that the Minister is considering legislation to change the person who will deal with this ultimately? </P>

However, under this amendment, bodies will automatically be allowed access to the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What powers will be conferred on the controller to allow him or her to investigate the background to an application? This is important because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently considering ways of registering and certifying companies which provide security services. When I served as Minister for Justice, I established a working group to investigate this matter and I received its report just before I left office. It has taken a long time <Col N="1503" /> for action to be taken in this area. However, the recommendation of the group was that companies which provide security should be registered.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to achieve in this section in terms of registering bodies may be used as a template in the drafting of other legislation. We must ensure that a mechanism is put in place to allow the controller to consider the character and standing of an applicant. For example, could a person who served a five year prison sentence for a crime they committed apply to become a collector? Is there a provision under which certain people can be prevented from becoming collectors? We must remember that these people will be collecting money and passing themselves off as the owners of copyright and, therefore, we will be dependent on their honour. Deputy Stanton is correct, the controller does not appear to have power to investigate these people's bona fides.</P>

      <P>In addition, section 171(6) states that the information to be prescribed by the Minister shall include the name and address of an applicant, the names of the chairperson and other members of the board, a copy of the memorandum and articles of association and the details of a scheme.

    <P>I wonder whether this amendment is still relevant in view of the impending introduction of compulsory registration for licensing bodies.

      <P>In addition to certain educational copying exceptions, it was originally intended to allow two additional categories of exceptions to be overridden by a licensing scheme certified under section 169. These were the copying of abstracts of scientific or technical articles under section 88 and copying for the purpose of providing modified works to disabled persons by non-profit bodies under section 101. This decision was subsequently reconsidered and it was decided that very minor exceptions of public benefit could be granted out and out unqualified exceptions without fear of significant damage to the interests of rightsholders. Accordingly, these categories were removed in the Seanad from the scope of the certification provisions. Amendments Nos. 94 and 97 are technical amendments to section 169 which are required as a consequence of this change and which were overlooked in the Seanad.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> In page 98, line 30, to delete &ldquo;it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 are designed to meet a concern expressed by the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, the collecting society operating collective management of reprographic copyright rights in Ireland. The ICLA was concerned that the present text of section 169 could exclude its schemes from certification under that section because it routinely collects royalties from persons not affiliated to the organisation, a fact which raises doubts as to the possibility of identifying the works to which its licensing schemes are applied with sufficient certainty to meet the tests set by the current section. I am indebted to Members from all sides of the House for helping to draw attention to this difficulty on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While I remain less than convinced that the present text would have presented a reasonable Minister with any real difficulties in certifying ICLA schemes, it is not my wish to entertain any possibility of setting unreasonable barriers in the way of any collecting society going about its normal, legitimate business. Accordingly, I am happy to make the change embodied in amendment No. 96 which shifts the emphasis from the ability to identify a body of works with reasonable certainty to the Minister who must satisfy himself or herself that the licensing body in charge of the scheme is representative of a substantial proportion of the relevant rightsholders.</P>
    <P>I am not disposed to accepting amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 96. I have considered representations from the ICLA on this point and appreciate its wish to be doubly sure about this matter. However, I do not believe that changing the word &ldquo;proportion&rdquo; to &ldquo;number&rdquo; will help. It could be argued, for example, that a substantial number will only be judged by reference to a total number. It is the impossibility of knowing the identity and overall number of people it represents which caused the ICLA's problem with the current text.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when the ICLA's international confederate body made representations to me seeking to change section 169, it indicated that a test based on the ability of the collecting society to show it represented a &ldquo;significant proportion&rdquo; of the rightsholders concerned would be satisfactory. Under amendment No. 96 as it stands, a reasonable Minister would be even less likely to have a difficulty certifying ICLA licensing schemes under section 169 than he or she would under the present text. With due respect to the ICLA, I do not believe there would be any benefit to amending amendment No. 96 as proposed in amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 96. I ask the Deputies concerned not to move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recognition that a problem existed in regard to the ICLA which was concerned about its eligibility to be a licensing body. The ICLA remains concerned <Col N="1508" /> about the use of the word &ldquo;proportion&rdquo; in the new wording because it feels its openness to interpretation could prove problematic. The ICLA believes that the phrase &ldquo;substantial proportion&rdquo; implies a need to know the total number of rightsholders in the relevant category of works to which the scheme applies as a prerequisite to judge whether it actually represents a substantial proportion of rightsholders. The ICLA, for example, holds mandates from most Irish book publishers of note but the organisation goes on to explain that the word &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; includes publishers of once-off books and those who publish on the Internet. It also holds mandates from a handful of publishers of journals.</P>
      <P>How does one determine a substantial proportion of an unknown figure? Fifty is a substantial proportion of 100 but not of a larger number. If the word &ldquo;number&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;proportion&rdquo; in the section it will not be necessary to know the total number. That is the kernel of the submission from the ICLA to the Opposition and the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>He may have received a submission from the international body recommending the use of the word &ldquo;proportion&rdquo; but discussions and conversations can lead to people taking a broader view. Clearly the ICLA has looked at this document and decided to take a broader view and recommend the word &ldquo;number&rdquo;. The ICLA represents about 300 people who are members of the Irish Writers' Union but no one knows how many Irish authors exist. Two hundred is a substantial proportion of 300 but not of 1,000 and there may be 1,000 Irish authors who are not members of the Irish Writers' Union.</P>
      <P>The amendment would not have an adverse effect on the Bill and I hope the Minister of State will accept it.</P>

      <P>This Government amendment is really a management provision in relation to the keeping of the register of copyright licensing bodies registered under sections 38 and 145 of the Bill. Its terms are really implicit in the section as it stands.

      <P>As independent licensing bodies are much less likely to be an important feature in the performers' rights or database right areas, I have not felt it necessary to carry this particular provision forward into the later parts of the Bill.

      <P>I refer to my comments in our discussion of compulsory licensing following amendment No. 89. I do not think it would be reasonable at this stage to place burdens of verification of this nature on the controller nor do I think that imposing the burden of satisfying them on licensing bodies would be necessary or fair. I prefer the approach taken in Government amendments Nos. 98a, 135a and 139a but I will keep the question of conditions of registration under active review and will not hesitate to amend them should later developments show this to be necessary or desirable.</P>

      <P>What avenue is open to the user if charges are deemed to be excessive or inequitable? This amendment would allow a fast method of decision by the controller in such <Col N="1511" /> cases. What can the user do if he or she thinks charges are inequitable or excessive? Is there any way of appointing a person who can move in and examine the situation and decide whether the rightsholders are justified in asking for this money? Then somebody would be able to indicate what amount of money would be fair without having to go to court. It would be useful. The Minister keeps saying that he will not put the burden on the controller but it surely comes back to resources where the controller is concerned. The Government should provide the resources for the controller so that he or she can do the job he or she is being asked to do. Similarly, the resources should be supplied to the Department section and possibly to the opposition.</P>

He may be able, in what he is prescribing, to lawfully include some indication that if the scale of charges proposed to be levied is excessive or inequitable, the controller could examine that and adjudicate on it.

      <P>This is essentially a technical amendment required to ensure that the provision of section 178(5), dealing with joint authorship, also applies to works qualifying for the protection of Irish copyright law by virtue of their connection with convention countries to whom the protection was extended by an order under section 183. I am advised that no similar provision is necessary in relation to works connected to Irish copyright law by an order under section 184, as the lack of a general obligation to such countries under international law and the drafting of section 184 would allow such matters to be dealt with in the context of the section 184 order itself.</P>
      <P>There are no current proposals to make copyright treaties with non-convention countries on a bilateral basis and any possible need to make such a treaty is being rapidly and progressively reduced by the fact that more and more countries are joining the Berne Convention and the World Trade Organisation.</P>

      <P>In page 104, to delete lines 38 to 45.</P>
      <P>This amendment would excise lines 38 to 45, essentially section 183 (3). My net point is that power is conferred on the Government here to unilaterally amend the Act, change the scope, make fundamental renovations to the legislation without coming back to the House, purely on the basis that whatever multilateral or international conventions are entered into are automatically imported into the law here. This is not a good principle. As it has been 37 years since we last brought the law up to date, I fail to see the urgent necessity for it either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House, feel that subsection (3) gives the Government a degree of flexibility in responding to the emergence of new international agreements in the area of copyright and importantly, in adjusting the scope of national treatment to the particular scope of new agreements which may only address particular elements of copyright protection rather than its whole scope. We feel it is necessary and I regret I cannot accept this amendment to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, in general, international or multinational treaties or conventions to which Ireland might become party in years to come, need national legislation to implement them. Am I correct in saying that this just gives the Government the power to add to or delete from the list of agreements to which we are party <Col N="1514" /> but if we were adopting, or at European level, agreeing another convention or a directive, generally they would have to be imported into Irish law by legislation. From that point of view, there is the protection that the Dáil is not being bypassed. We might agree to an agreement but it might not become operable until we have passed legislation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right. These are international agreements. This gives us some degree of flexibility in that area. As the Deputy knows, there is always some scope within the provisions of directives to make adjustments, but the Deputy is right in suggesting that is the import of this section. We feel it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is straightforward and simple enough. Copyright legislation or intellectual property generally is not the only area where this country must enter into multilateral agreements and subscribe to international conventions. What is the practice in other areas? Is this a shortcut by the Minister and his officials to ensure that they do not have to return to this House again with primary legislation by providing an enabling section in this Bill that will permit the automatic importation into Irish law of new agreements or parts of new agreement that might be concluded in the future? This a straightforward point. Since we joined the EU, for example, there have been many such instruments and in most cases they require primary legislation or a certain process must be undertaken in terms of regulations to be made and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has an opportunity to comment on them, etc. I still do not know, following the Minister of State's remarks, what exactly is the situation in respect of the amendment and section 182(3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It does. This is very much a management issue also in that flexibility is given to the Government of the day with regard to international agreements. The Deputy is correct. The Minister of the day would not have to come into the House every other month or year to effect new legislation based on international agreements and, therefore, it provides flexibility in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the Attorney General again supports this view. I referred earlier to the fact that there will be developments at EU level on copyright. We are coming into the House after 37 years and it will not take that long again before the broader issue of copyright will be revisited but this clause provides space and time for the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a peculiar subsection. I assume that if the Government makes an order, it must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way and approved <Col N="1515" /> before it takes effect. That provision would be there. Sometimes such orders are laid before the Houses and are not debated, which is Deputy Rabbitte's point. We have all discovered how important and weighty legislation such as this is and how far-reaching it can be; therefore, we are a little wary of short cuts. We have already witnessed the benefit of detailed debate on this legislation in both Houses. We would be loathe to agree to this, especially when lists of international agreements can be deleted or added. If they are factored into the legislation, the Act could be totally changed by an order of the Government of the day and that is not acceptable. Perhaps the Minister will inform us whether that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been discussion and banter all day about different people on different sides of the House. Were it not for the last EU Presidency, the Minister of State would be on this side of the House. I do not mean that in any personal sense. The last EU Presidency took up so much of the time of the then Cabinet that other matters were not focused on and nobody cared much, yet one had to do a good job because if one did not, one would hear all about it. I am a little concerned about a scenario where the Minister of the day attends meetings of the Council of Ministers, new legislation is agreed in this obscure area and it can be more or less automatically imported into Irish law without this House scrutinising it or having any say in it or knowledge about it or input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> With all due respect to the Minister of State's overworked officials, it is not good practice. The Minister of State said there were precedents but he does not know what are they. There may well be precedents but it is still a bad idea. Earlier, Deputy Owen correctly referred to the fact that nobody knew the detail of the Copyright Act, 1963, but one can bet one's life that very few people, other than those in the Public Gallery, will know the detail of this legislation. It is not a good democratic principle to include a wide, catch all, enabling section to permit legislation enacted in Europe to be imported automatically into Irish law. This legislation may not be widely known or understood but it is terribly important in the context of an economy in the information age. It is a bad principle and I cannot understand the reason for it. The Minister of State has more or less told us on a number of occasions and, latterly on Deputy Stanton's <i>droit de suite</i> amendment, that he or whoever is in his position, is likely to come back to the House in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>We have waited 37 years for this renovation. Why must this enabling clause be included? It is anti-democratic and I am unhappy about it. I would like to know what are the precedents elsewhere. I cannot believe that they would be extensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 107:</P>
      <P>In page 110, line 4, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or, in the case of the authority specified in paragraph (<i>a</i>), the publisher of any book published in the State,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the statutory book deposit scheme rather than to copyright proper. It is designed to allow the National Library of Ireland only to seek delivery of all books published in Ireland within the meaning of this section, which is to say, all books commercially circulated in Ireland. It is understood that the National Library would use this power to strengthen its referenced collection of works of Irish interest, irrespective of their place of first publication. This change follows from consultation between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and I am happy to endorse it.</P>
      <P>I should remind Deputies that the book deposit scheme is associated with copyright only in a historical sense. Deposit of books, in particular in libraries, was once a requirement placed on persons wishing to enjoy copyright protection for their works. However, this has not been the case in either Irish or UK law for a long time and would now be forbidden by the Berne Convention as a formality precedent to the enjoyment of copyright.</P>
      <P>The book deposit scheme is now quite simply a levy on publishers which is justified by educational and national heritage considerations rather than anything much to do with copyright. The present scheme has grown in a rather unstructured and unconsidered way &ndash; a fact which has been the cause of considerable happiness to publishers in particular.</P>
      <P>As the Minister with responsibility for legislation which contains this scheme for purely historical reasons, I am not particularly happy with the situation. Accordingly, as soon as time and resources permit, I will be promoting an interdepartmental inquiry aimed at making recommendations to the Government on the future of the book deposit scheme. In the meantime, and in the absence of full consideration of the issues, I would not be anxious to disturb the present scheme more than is strictly necessary through the enactment of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised with us during a submission by people who appeared before the committee. I was taken by the valid point that, from time to time, a very small print run is done on books. I do not want to diminish the archives of material published in this country in any way and I fully respect the fact that a book deposit system has to be in place. I have heard arguments from both sides: one from the Trinity College library in Dublin, and the other from one of the smaller book publishing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> I want to deal with the concept of free copies of books that have to be given to a variety of libraries. On Committee Stage, I worked it out that approximately 13 copies of a book have to be deposited. If a publisher is only producing a print run of 100 books, that is quite a sizeable proportion. The company which wrote to me about this scheme said that, on average, it dispatches on a yearly basis approximately £18,000 worth of books under the 1963 legislation. It made the point that in today's terms, that is equivalent to a salary and it would rather use some of that money to employ another person.</P>
    <P>The argument is not being made that it should not deposit copies of the book in the National Library and the British library. However, its point is that the burden of <i>gratis </i>copies to all the other libraries is heavy for a small run of books. There is no problem if the run is above 300 copies. It is not unreasonable to deposit books in those circumstances, but it is different if it is a selective publishing run of a special book.</P>
    <P>However, the counter argument has been made by Trinity College, which indicated that it has a good relationship in terms of all UK published material. It receives a copy of every UK published book and material. It pointed out that the material it received last year was equivalent to £4.97 million worth of books. That is a nice deposit to receive in the form of books. Trinity College recognises the concerns of people producing small runs and it suggested that perhaps the financial burden on publishers, and particularly limited or highly specialised publishers, could be addressed by means of a fiscal concession issued on the production costs of the deposit copies supplied.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his indication that he intends to consider the concept of book deposits again to ensure that it is good for the country but does not cause any unnecessary hardship to the publishers of small runs of books. On the basis of his promise to return to this issue in the new Bill that will be introduced shortly or by another method, I will not move my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 111, line 22, after &ldquo;£500&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to pay such sum not exceeding the value of the book as the court may decide which shall be paid to the trustees or authority to whom the book should have been delivered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Rabbitte suggested an amendment to insert, after &ldquo;£500&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;and in addition the person shall be liable to be ordered to comply with this section&rdquo;. I outlined at the time that the advice of the Attorney General's office was that this amendment was not necessary as it is implicit that all sections of the Bill must be complied with.</P>
      <P>However, I have given the matter further consideration and I am of the view that publishers who do not comply with this section should, as well as the fine, be liable for the value of the book which should be paid to the trustee or authority to whom the book should have been delivered. Accordingly, I tabled the amendment which addresses Deputy Rabbitte's concern in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's goodwill in the matter but I wonder if we are <i>ad idem</i>? Is he suggesting that, in addition to the fine, one will have to pay the equivalent value of the book to the trustees or the authority to whom the book should have been delivered? My point was that paying the fine should not exonerate one from delivering the book.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not seeking to raise a levy for the relevant authority. Perhaps he could reconsider his advice on this matter. I am a little surprised that the notion of penalising a person outside a straightforward fine by way of raising a tax for the National Library or whoever else got past the parliamentary draftsman. The idea was that it might be worthwhile, not least in the type of situation Deputy Owen outlined earlier, to pay one's £500 fee and not deliver the book. The book is the important aspect but perhaps the <Col N="1523" /> Minister of State could outline his views in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember this discussion. The person should be obliged to pay the fine if he or she breaches the section, but also to deliver the book. The argument I made when I was a member of a county council was that the payment of a levy for car parking was no use because one cannot park on a levy, unless it is a levee at the side of a river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot park on £500. The idea in this area is that books or magazines should be deposited. The fine will go to the courts and the library or institution which should have received the book will not benefit. Unless the phrase &ldquo;and this shall be spent on purchasing the book&rdquo; is inserted after the term &ldquo;paying the sum not exceeding the value of the book&rdquo;, the Minister of State will not have taken on board Deputy Rabbitte's valid point. The person must pay the fine but the book or magazine must also be produced and the body receiving the money should be obliged to buy the book. Otherwise, a poor box type fund could be built up if material was not being handed over and this could be a difficulty.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputies' points. We are dealing with Report Stage of the Bill so this matter must be addressed one way or another. We endeavoured to pursue the issue in a certain way and the best solution I could suggest is that I and my ministerial colleagues will consider the book deposit scheme in the context of the interdepartmental review. I assure the Deputies that this will be done in view of the comments made. In the meantime, I ask the Deputies to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the section should not be amended if it is to be considered in the review. Paying a sum not exceeding the value of the book will not mean that the library receives the book, but perhaps it is better than nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what is wrong with Deputy Rabbitte's proposal. He is suggesting that if a person fails to comply with the section, he or she must pay a £500 fine, which, as Deputy Owen said, goes to the courts, and then comply with the section. The Minister's suggestion is that if a book is worth £10, the person must pay that amount. If the book is rare or, as Deputy Owen said, part of a small run, it would be impossible to put a value on the loss to the institution concerned. The institution should get the book. The money is no good to it if the book is not available for purchase. The Minister of State is defeating the purpose and I urge him to accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>

I have made one suggestion as to how we might deal with this and Deputy Owen suggested I should consider withdrawing my amendment. I do not have a problem with the views of the House. However, we should accept my amendment which strengthens the provision. I acknowledge there is an issue to be addressed in the context of the interdepartmental review of the book deposit scheme.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;194.&ndash;Sections 65 and 66 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, are hereby amended by the substitution of the following sections therefor:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;65.&ndash;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the publisher of any material to which this section applies shall, within one month or such longer period as the authority having control of the National Library of Ireland may allow after its publication, deliver at his or her own expense, a copy of the material to that authority and the authority shall give a written receipt to the publisher for any and all such material delivered to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The publisher of material to which this section applies that relates wholly or mainly to Ireland shall, if a written demand for any such material is made by the authority referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> not later than 12 months after its publication, deliver a copy <Col N="1525" /> of the material to that authority within one month after receipt of the demand or, if the demand was made before its publication, within one month or such longer period as the authority may in any particular case allow after its publication.</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, may make such regulations as he or she considers appropriate in relation to the quality and format of material to which this section applies in cases where the copies of such material are not of uniform quality or can be published in different formats.</P>
    <P>(4) Where a publisher fails to comply with this section, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 and to pay such sum not exceeding the value of the material as the court may decide which shall be paid to the trustees or authority to whom the material should have been delivered.</P>
    <P>(5) In this section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;material to which this section applies&rdquo; means material that is of such class as may be specified in regulations made by the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and in this definition, &ldquo;material&rdquo; includes any engraving, photograph, text of a play, cinematograph film, microfilm, video recording, sound recording, record, diskette, magnetic tape, compact disc, or other thing on or in which works or information or the representations thereof is written, recorded, stored or reproduced but does not include local records or local archives within the meaning, in each case, of section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1994, or books within the meaning of <i>section 187 </i>of the <i>Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000</i>;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;publisher&rdquo;, for the purposes of this section, means a person who issues to the public, or makes available to the public by means of an electronic retrieval system, material to which this section applies;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;work&rdquo;, for the purposes of this section, has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 2 </i>of the <i>Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000</i>.</P>
    <P>(6) This section shall apply only to material concerned substantially or primarily with Ireland. In cases of doubt, the certification of the Minister to the effect that material is concerned substantially or primarily with Ireland shall satisfy the requirements of this subsection.</P>
    <P>(7) The Minister, following consultation <Col N="1526" /> with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, may by order apply this section, with such modifications and adaptations as he or she considers necessary, to one or more of the institutions or bodies referred to in <i>section 187 </i>of the <i>Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000</i>.</P>
    <P>(8) Section 6 of the Dublin City University Act, 1989, and section 7 of the University of Limerick Act, 1989, are hereby repealed.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment. The intention of section 65 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, was to extend to the book deposit scheme to an extent which would allow the National Library of Ireland to seek delivery of certain materials other than traditional books. Section 65 depends on a linkage with the book deposit section of prevailing copyright legislation, currently section 56 of the Copyright Act, 1963. It is, therefore, necessary to amend section 65 to ensure it can continue to work in conjunction with the new book deposit arrangements which will replace section 56 of the 1963 Act under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The materials in question, as indicated in subsection (5) of the replacement section proposed by this section, would include such subjects as compact discs, microfilms, video recordings, cinematograph films and sound recordings. It will not have escaped Deputies' attention that the technology specific nature of the section is not consistent with the technology neutral approach of the Bill in general. This arises from the fact that the objectives of the National Cultural Institutions Act on this point are essentially technology specific.</P>
    <P>I understand that section 65 has not yet been commenced but that its commencement in relation to cinematographic films and videos is being considered. Full commencement of the section, including such materials as compact discs, photographs and sound recordings, would appear improbable in the near future since it would be likely to prove controversial.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that it would be prudent to enact this amendment to ensure that section 65 remains workable after the commencement of the new copyright legislation. The longer term future of this measure is likely to be determined by the Government's final decision on foot of the proposed interdepartmental examination of the book deposit scheme to which I have already referred.</P>

It was subsequently pointed out to me by a member of the Honorable Society of Kings Inns that the society uses the spelling &ldquo;Honorable&rdquo; in its title, although I suspect that has more to do with the way King Henry VIII spelt the word than it does with the spelling in American English.

      <P>In page 115, line 13, to delete &ldquo;A&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>, a&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose acceptance of amendments Nos. 116<i>a</i>, 117<i>a</i>, 119<i>a</i> and 119<i>b</i> and consequently I will not be accepting amendment No. 117, which appears to represent an alternative approach to the same problem.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage members of the select committee pointed out there was an apparent overlap between what is now section 201, the exclusive making available right of performers in relation to recordings of their performances, and what is now section 204 which deals with the right to equitable remuneration of performers in relation to the exploitation of their sound recordings. Having reviewed the matter, I find myself in agreement and the purpose of my amendment is to disentangle the two sections and to ensure that no dual right is created for performers in respect of the exploitation of sound recordings.</P>
      <P>Deputies will know that the approach adopted here is simpler than that adopted under copyright and, in particular, that the dreaded phrase, &ldquo;equitable remuneration&rdquo; appears. These differences arise for two reasons. First, elaborate special licensing arrangements are not required in connection with section 201 because it is not expected that these performers rights will be exercised collectively on an independent basis. In practice, it appears that where these rights are managed collectively, principally in the music and sound recording field, collection of payments will be done through agreements with existing copyright collecting agencies, rather than by independent collecting societies. In these circumstances, the presence of a section 38 type structure would only confuse the process of managing these rights.</P>
      <P>Second, our room for manoeuvre is limited in this area by the presence of the EU rental and lending directive which confers on performers a right to equitable remuneration, in so many words, in the circumstances covered by section 204. Following the difficulties which arose from the earlier proposal to use this concept in the copyright field, I gave consideration to the question of whether alternative terminology should be adopted here but decided that the directive would preclude any such change.</P>

      <P>This amendment is required to cure an oversight and bring the performer's 'making available' right provided for in section 201 into harmony with the equivalent provision on copyright contained in section 39.

      <P>I mentioned on Committee Stage that the Deputies' motivation in putting forward these amendments seems to be to allow the Minister to specify what amounted to substantial in terms of the financial investment in a database for the purpose of the database right. I sympathise with this intention but, having carefully considered the matter, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>The concept of substantial investment is drawn from Article 7 of the EU database directive which defines the object of protection of the database right. While the directive does not specifically prohibit the sort of provision suggested by the Deputies, there is a practical problem in that question of what represents a substantial investment is a relative one as much as an absolute one, in other words, what would be an insubstantial investment for a large database, such as a national telephone directory, might be quite substantial when applied to a smaller database. For this reason, there would be a significant risk that setting a specific financial minimum might deprive some databases of their entitlements to protection under the directive. In light of those considerations, I hope the Deputies will agree that it would be better to leave the question of what is substantial to the facts of the individual cases. I hope they will agree to withdraw these amendments.</P>

I am disappointed he is unwilling to take on board the concept of specifying what is substantial. I will not go to the wall on this, but I hope it is not one of those areas where the controller will end up tearing his hair trying to decide what is substantial. I will not press the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA has had another successful year according to its 1999 annual report. Some 18,000 jobs were created, which is another record. This job creation level continues the unprecedented growth rates of the previous five years. It means that employment in IDA-supported companies has increased nationally by 50% since 1994. However, the same report makes grim reading for those of us in the north west region, particularly in County Donegal. The north west region consists of counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. Of the 18,000 plus jobs created nationally in 1999, less than 300 came to the north west, or less than <Col N="1541" /> 2% of the total. However, the real situation is far more critical and disturbing.</P>
    <P>During 1999, overall employment in IDA-backed industries in the north west declined by a massive 1,235 which is by far the highest reduction on record. It is estimated that 1,200 of these job losses were in County Donegal. The 1999 figures are not a once-off phenomenon. The north west has consistently lagged behind the other regions in each year since 1993. The difference is that 1999 was by far the worst year from the job losses perspective. Donegal has the highest unemployment rate in the country. While the national unemployment rate is 4.6%, in Donegal it is 20% or more. This is intolerable and cannot be allowed continue. There have been major job losses in Buncrana, Raphoe, Millford, the Finn Valley and throughout south Donegal. Unless the region is to go into an unemployment and economic tailspin drastic and urgent action must be taken.</P>
    <P>I accept that IDA Ireland cannot direct industrialists to locate in an area against its better judgment. This is where Government policy plays a crucial role. The Government can direct that preferential treatment be given to industries that locate in certain areas. A company establishing an industry in Dublin gets almost the same level of grant assistance as one locating in Donegal. This policy is leading to an unbalanced regional distribution of jobs to the advantage of the east coast and to the detriment of the north west and Donegal. More generous concessions and incentives must be offered to companies willing to locate in the north west. Limited recognition was given to such a strategy in the Finance Act, 1998. That year the upper Shannon basin, comprising counties Leitrim and Longford and parts of Roscommon, Cavan and Sligo had been given generous concessions that can be availed of by industrialists and other investors who locate there. These incentives have already stabilised the employment situation in these counties and greatly increased economic development. The effectiveness of such tax incentives is beyond dispute. These concessions should be extended to Donegal immediately.</P>
    <P>In the north west there is a core of educated and skilled young people, products of the Letterkenny and Sligo institutes of technology. However, they leave the area to take up employment with high-tech companies in Dublin and along the east coast. They leave by bus on Sunday evenings and return on Fridays for the weekend. Why can we not attract industries to the north west to provide employment for these young people in their own environment? </P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the quality of life in Donegal and in the north west is as good as, if not better, than that in Dublin. Housing is cheaper and travel is certainly much easier. We cannot afford to have the lifeblood of rural areas drained away. What is now a temporary weekly absence may eventually become permanent.</P>
    <P>County Donegal has given this Government <Col N="1542" /> more loyalty and support than any other county &ndash; five out of its six Deputies support the Government in Dáil Éireann on a daily basis. The county is also represented by a Senator and an MEP who are Government supporters. However, in the area of investment and job creation that loyalty is not reciprocated by the Government. Donegal is being taken for granted. We simply cannot have a repeat of 1999. Rhetoric and promises are no longer acceptable or sufficient. We demand a fairer share of the spoils of the Celtic tiger economy, nothing less is acceptable. The Donegal task force has prepared a development blueprint for the county. Its immediate implementation is the only solution. This can only be done by a more determined and serious Government commitment &ndash; so far that commitment has been totally inadequate and pathetic.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the decline in employment in the Donegal area as indicated in the recently published IDA Ireland 1999 annual report.</P>
      <P>While almost 300 new jobs were filled in the north west region in 1999, the difficulties and challenges facing the textile sector, particularly the Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal, impacted heavily on IDA Ireland's year end results. Job losses in Donegal amounted to nearly 1,200, attributable mainly to job reductions at Fruit of the Loom plants and the closure of the Austin Reed Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
      <P>However, I assure the Deputy the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and has impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the county.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are structured on a regional basis so as to facilitate a more balanced regional distribution of jobs and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In addition, IDA Ireland is working closely with the providers of infrastructure and the educational/training bodies, etc. to deliver improved facilities for industry in the regions. The EU Commission has recognised the needs of the Donegal region in that it forms part of the Objective One region for development purposes and will benefit from a relatively higher level of permitted State aid under the new EU regional aid guidelines, 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to continuing to market the Donegal region as part of its overall target to deliver half of all new jobs from greenfield projects into the Objective One regions in the coming years. IDA Ireland has a regional office in Letterkenny and the agency has encouraged a large number of people to visit the region in the past 18 months. However, IDA's strategy is not merely a question of jobs dispersal, it also <Col N="1543" /> aims to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to the regions.</P>
    <P>As a result of this increased focus by the agency, there have been a number of project announcements over the past year. The securing and start up of the PacifiCare project in Letterkenny was evidence of an important turning point in the industrial base for Donegal and the announcement by Prudential Insurance Company of America to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny early in 2000 was a further significant flagship project to arrive in the region. Both of these are already key reference sellers for the region and their presence will drive further growth and opportunities in the period ahead. A German software company, Ebylls, is also setting up a software development project at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology. The company recently announced a plan to create 50 jobs in Letterkenny at full development.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of attracting overseas industry to regional locations is the availability of quality industrial property. IDA has put in place a specific property programme which has resulted in the construction of new advance factory and office space in Letterkenny. The agency has also acquired five acres of land adjacent to the existing two acres of IDA land at Lisfannon, Buncrana. Consultants have been engaged to prepare a plan for the development of the land, which will include the construction of an advance factory. In addition, IDA Ireland continues to market the vacant Fruit of the Loom buildings in Milford and Raphoe. The agency is also marketing an advance factory in Carndonagh in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>The improvement of business support services, such as the new Derry-Dublin air service to commence immediately between Dublin and city of Derry airports and to be run by Aer Arann, will be a major boost for the work programme of the industrial development agencies. It is expected that this service will lead to an increase in the flow of business to County Donegal. The efforts of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in conjunction with the implementation of the recommendations of Donegal employment initiative will ensure that the needs of the entire county are reflected in the implementation of the national development plan. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, Deputy Cecilia Keaveney, has made the case for this region on many occasions&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>While I wish in the first instance to draw the Minister's attention to the individual circumstances of two national schools, I also wish to highlight the need for a specific policy in the allocation of resources to all disadvantaged national schools located in the Government's designated drugs task force areas.</P>
      <P>The schools are St. Michael's CBS national school at St. Michael's Estate, Inchicore and Our Lady of Lourdes national school, also in Inchicore. Part of this area and its community have been devastated by the heroin scourge over the past 20 years. Few communities have suffered as much. The work the local national schools are doing is indispensable to the efforts being made to help the most vulnerable children in extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>St. Michael's CBS has children from the Traveller community, children of refugees, children from a residential home as well as children from St. Michael's Estate. This is a local authority flats complex which, because of acute social problems, is scheduled to be demolished and replaced with modern houses. While the school is grateful for the resources it has, its authorities believe that &ldquo;taking a teacher at this stage would greatly add to their difficulties&rdquo;. The school is just two pupils short of the required number to retain its present staff.</P>
      <P>Ironically, over the past year the school principal has attended 25 meetings of the Government sponsored integrated services project on which the Department of Education and Science is represented and which, I understood, is designed to help maximise resources in this pilot area. Little wonder that he is appalled at the prospect of the opposite, losing one of his teachers rather than obtaining additional help.</P>
      <P>The second school, Our Lady of Lourdes national school, had a shortfall of seven pupils in September 1999 but since then it has taken in eight additional children and will have 40 new entrants in September this year. It is likely to qualify under the developing school criteria but since it has been told by the Department that it will lose a teacher, the school is extremely anxious that in light of its improved numbers the directive that it lose a teacher be withdrawn. The school points out that its existing staff is stretched to the limit trying to maintain a high standard of education in an area of increasing deprivation and disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response of Government to the heroin drugs crisis was to designate 13 areas, mainly in Dublin, suffering severe deprivation where the heroin scourge was most concentrated. Drugs task forces were set up in partnership with the communities in these areas. The Government also established pilot integrated services projects in the most deprived communities, St. Michael's Estate being in one of them. A special Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, <Col N="1545" /> chaired by the Taoiseach, was also formed to approve new strategies to maximise resources in these designated areas, or so we are told. The general aim of these measures was to provide additional assistance targeted at the communities most vulnerable to the drugs crisis.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that the Department of Education and Science plays a full and meaningful role in this process. I do not believe it has yet done so. Education, especially at primary level, is critical in the fight against drugs and social disadvantage. Flexibility should be introduced when considering all disadvantaged national schools in drugs task force areas so that where the enrolment of pupils falls marginally below the quota agreed with the INTO, these schools should not lose teachers. It would be preferable and in line with apparent Government policy if national schools in drugs task force areas could be allocated at least one additional teacher over the number for which they would normally qualify.</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue with the general secretary of the INTO, Senator O'Toole, on more than one occasion and I do not believe he would oppose such a move. It would have been preferable if the INTO had itself proposed these additional measures since it represents the staff in these schools and is aware of the extent of the problem its members face.</P>
    <P>The source of the heroin scourge lies in social deprivation. It follows, therefore, that national schools are in the front line and must get all the resources they need if the most vulnerable children are to have any chance to break the cycle and secure equality of opportunity. While I have referred to two such schools there may well be others in drug hit communities facing the same loss of teachers. I make the same case for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of the first school referred to by the Deputy is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 92 as at 30 September, 1998. The school also has the services of a concessionary teacher due to the school's disadvantaged status, two remedial teachers, one temporary special additional assistant and a shared home school liaison teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-2001 school year is based, was 81. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment entitles the school to two mainstream class teachers. The enrolment requirement for the retention of the third teacher is 83.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current staffing of the second school is a <Col N="1546" /> principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 248 as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of two concessionary posts due to the disadvantaged status of the school, two remedial teachers, two special additional assistants and a home school liaison teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-2001 school year is based, was 233. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment entitles the school to eight mainstream class teachers. The enrolment requirement for the retention of the ninth teacher is 240. In view of this, unfortunately, the retention of the mainstream posts in these schools cannot be authorised.</P>
    <P>Both schools referred to by the Deputy are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme. As a result of their inclusion in the scheme, the schools are allocated adequate staffing to apply a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, St. Michael's CBS has been allocated a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post and Our Lady of Lourdes national school has been allocated two disadvantaged concessionary teaching posts. The schools also have the services of a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator on a shared basis. By virtue of their inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme, the schools are also in receipt of an enhanced capitation grant of £94 per pupil.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is currently implementing a £194 million three year multi-sectoral programme to offset educational disadvantage that will provide specific supports for early education, primary, post-primary and third levels of the formal system as well as lifelong and continuing education. The supports will target people at risk of or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. The supports will also be provided to those with poor levels of literacy skills as well as people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The current disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level is inflexible and does not take account of different levels of need. For this reason, although the scheme encompasses 16% of all primary school pupils, it is not necessarily an effective mechanism for assisting those most in need.</P>
    <P>The new programme involves a comprehensive survey of all primary schools to assess the level of concentration in each school, of pupils who have background characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools. Work on the analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science intends allocating additional resources next September to selected primary schools that have the highest concentrations of young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and or extra funding which will be allocated to <Col N="1547" /> selected schools and will reflect the levels of need identified. Within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain the supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help. More than £25 million will be made available to this new scheme at primary level in the next three years. The Minister expects to make a further announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.</P>
      <P>If men rather than women gave birth, I would not have to raise this issue this evening. If men gave birth there would not be a problem. If men gave birth, male medical personnel, male administrators and bureaucrats and male politicians would ensure the whole process of labour and delivery was as pain free and stress free as possible.</P>
      <P>Women give birth and their needs in relation to pain relief are not being met in many maternity units in this country, particularly in Sligo General Hospital. While the birth of a new baby is normally a joyous occasion, it can be stressful, traumatic and painful for the mother during the birth period. Giving birth is not an elective procedure. Women cannot order the day of labour or delivery. By and large, the date on which a baby is born is decided by natural processes outside of the remit of hospital administration. Given that fact, one would assume that pregnant women would be able to rely on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week service for the administration of epidural anaesthesia for those who chose an epidural. That is not the case for women in Sligo and Leitrim. The epidural service in Sligo General Hospital is only available on five days out of seven. The days in which the epidural service is available varies depending on the rotas for non-consultant hospital doctors. Women who go into labour and arrive at the hospital expecting epidural may draw the short straw in the epidural lottery and find they are unlucky enough to be delivering on a day when a service is not available to them.</P>
      <P>There were on average 1,283 births in Sligo General Hospital in the past two years. That is an average of 106 births per month. Between January and May 2000, there were 521 babies born in Sligo General Hospital. How many of their mothers who wished to do so were able to avail of an epidural? What percentage of the average 106 mothers who will give birth in Sligo General Hospital this month will have no choice but to give birth without the aid of an epidural? Can the Minister stand over such shoddy treatment of pregnant women? Sligo General Hospital is one non-consultant hospital doctor short for the past six months. It is only with the goodwill of the already over-worked NCHD that some of the 520 women who gave birth in Sligo this year were able to have an epidural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I understand it is hoped to supply a full seven days service in July when the new NCHD contracts are signed. That is not good enough. There are no guarantees. We are likely to be short nationally of 142 non-consultant hospital doctors from 1 July onwards. What are women supposed to do in the meantime and what will they do in Sligo if there are no appointments in July? The Minister is responsible for this situation. He and his predecessor have presided over the rapid deterioration in our health services and it is time he put patients first. It is time for action and for the restoration of the best possible care. Pregnant women should not have to worry about whether there will be a doctor available to give them an epidural. It is a scandal that matters have reached this stage.</P>
    <P>I hope to hear tonight that the Minister of State has an immediate and comprehensive solution to this dreadful problem. I hope she will acknowledge that women are entitled to full and proper care at all our maternity hospitals and to services they seek when giving birth. I hope to hear that pregnant women will have one less matter to worry about when they go into labour in Sligo General Hospital in the weeks to come. I fear, however, that they will be disappointed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for allowing me to contribute to this very important debate and I compliment him for raising the issue. It is outrageous at a time of such prosperity that the epidural service at Sligo General Hospital is available only at random during the week. Given the 106 births per month, it is unbelievable that expectant mothers are not assured of an epidural service. This is very alarming and I would say to the Minister of State that a promise of a July appointment is not good enough. We need a guarantee as to when a consultant will be appointed. This is no reassurance for people in areas of the north west such as Donegal and Sligo which Sligo General Hospital serves. I appeal to the Minister of State to give a clear indication of when this appointment will take place because expectant parents from Sligo and Leitrim need such reassurance. Given the present situation, some expectant parents are making arrangements to have their babies delivered outside the region which is causing undue stress to expectant mothers.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Shatter and Perry for raising this important issue. I assure both Deputies that the Minister for Health and Children and the two Ministers of State are committed to improvements in the health service in maintaining the best aspects of it and ensuring investment is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services at Sligo General Hospital is a matter for the North Western Health Board in the first instance. This Government has displayed a strong commitment to the <Col N="1549" /> development of services in Sligo General Hospital in line with the priorities identified by the North Western Health Board. In this regard, there are a number of ongoing developments at Sligo General Hospital. These include a day service unit and pathology services. In addition, obstetrics-gynaecology services and cancer services have been enhanced by the appointment of a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist and a consultant oncologist, respectively. Approval was also granted for the appointment of a consultant histopathologist and a third general surgeon.</P>
    <P>The North Western Health Board introduced a 24 hour epidural service in July 1997 at Sligo General Hospital and the demand for this service has grown in recent years. There are at present five consultant anaesthetists at Sligo General Hospital and the board is in the process of filling a sixth post. In addition, a further consultant post has recently been approved by the Department.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ongoing development of anaesthetist services at the hospital, I am aware from the North Western Health Board that recent difficulties have arisen in relation to an epidural service at Sligo General Hospital. The board has advised that the epidural service is dependent on the availability of non-consultant hospital doctor anaesthetists. The board has experienced short-term difficulties in this regard which have impacted on this epidural service on a number of occasions since May of this year. However, I am advised by the board that it anticipates that these short-term difficulties will be resolved with the July NCHD intake. Notwithstanding the current national issues in the recruitment of NCHD posts from July, I understand from the board that it is satisfied that all anaesthetist posts will be filled at Sligo General Hospital. This will enable a comprehensive epidural service to be restored at the hospital. The overall objective of the significant ongoing development of service that is under way at Sligo General Hospital is to ensure that the services available to the people in the region are responsive to their needs. Clearly, the early restoration of a full epidural service is essential to that. In this regard, the Minister is encouraged by the fact that the North Western Health Board is taking the necessary steps to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Riverstown Garda station some weeks ago. I inspected the station building, including the official accommodation which is occupied by one garda, the only other member of the Garda stationed at Riverstown apart from the sergeant. The accommodation is in a deplorable condition. The plaster is falling off the walls, there is no central heating and it reeks of dampness. The garda has occupied the accommodation for 15 years. In all that time nothing has been done to refurbish this very old and partially dilapidated building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Riverstown sub-district is a large sub-district <Col N="1550" /> and the amount of work the garda does in his day to day policing of the area, and in the community in general, cannot be evaluated or adequately described in the short time I have. It is clear that this garda is totally dedicated to this work &ndash; his regular visits to old people living alone in remote and isolated areas are prime examples of that dedication.</P>
    <P>Unless the accommodation he occupies at Riverstown Garda station is refurbished in the near future, he will have to vacate it. The entire station is a health hazard. The garda in question is from Easkey, 30 miles from Riverstown. If he has to vacate the official accommodation there he will have to commute between Easkey and the station. The garda is available on a regular basis to the local community in the Riverstown area, something it appreciates greatly. On several occasions he has given freely of his time to help those in need of Garda assistance. If he is forced to commute 30 miles from his residence to his station, the community will lose the ready availability of the garda, which will be a great pity.</P>
    <P>Major refurbishment is planned for the Riverstown station. The drawing &ndash; Drawing No. 830/A/02 &ndash; for the refurbishment was prepared in September 1997 by Lochlainn Regional Architect, Office of Public Works. The premises were visited by the Garda housing officer in March 1999 following a parliamentary question I asked about the state of the building. Taking into account all that has taken place over the last two years, it is reasonable to expect that this work would have at least started. This is far from the case. I also note under reference number 7/237, dated 26 July 1999, that the Riverstown station is listed for maintenance probably in 2003.</P>
    <P>If Riverstown station is left without repairs for another three years, not alone will the garda have to vacate the station, but the public area of the building will also have to be vacated. To remain in occupation of the building would be a health hazard. Unless urgent action is taken, the state of the building will rapidly deteriorate further.</P>
    <P>I respectfully request that the Minister takes this matter very seriously with the Garda housing officer at the Office of Public Works, who is already aware of the state of the building, and that it is impressed on him how important this facility is to Riverstown. The garda in question is owed the basic facility of comfortable accommodation in recognition of his service to the community. The station is a hazard to the garda's health. I call on the Minister to issue a major works requisition to commence work immediately on Riverstown Garda station.</P>
    <P>I have visited the station myself and could not describe the conditions. The station is like something in the 19th century, not the 21st century. The Garda presence in Riverstown in a time of attacks on old people in isolated areas is an invaluable asset. This sub-district serves a huge area. It would be an outrage if the community were to lose the one garda who resides there. <Col N="1551" /> Without the immediate sanction of funding to upgrade the station, that is what will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to explain the latest position regarding Riverstown Garda station.</P>
      <P>Riverstown Garda station in the Sligo-Leitrim division is a sub-district station with a party of two members, one of garda rank and one sergeant. As Deputy Perry is aware, following an inspection of Riverstown Garda station by the Garda housing officer, the Office of Public Works provided an estimate of substantial costs for the refurbishment of the existing station and official accommodation. In view of the level of available financial resources allocated for major Garda refurbishment projects, consultations with the Office of Public Works are continuing to determine the most economically advantageous option to improve the garda accommodation at Riverstown. As an interim measure, the station was painted externally and internally last July.</P>
      <P>Regarding the progress on the more substantive issue of refurbishing the existing station, it will be appreciated that all such major projects must proceed in accordance with the priorities of the Garda building programme. The programme is designed to ensure the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or major refurbishment of Garda stations as policing requirements demand and overall priorities allow.</P>
      <P>There are a number of building projects which require attention before work may proceed at Riverstown. The Minister cannot, therefore, give an indication at this time when precisely construction work will commence. I can assure the House, however, that he is determined to see the project proceed and that there will be no avoidable delay in providing new accommodation at this location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that a great deal <Col N="1552" /> of work has been done in recent years in improving standards of accommodation at Garda stations throughout the State. It is, however, a large scale operation. The programme of improvement has a high priority both with the Minister and the Government. This year, for instance, £10 million has been provided for major new construction projects in the Office of Public Works Vote and £4 million will be spent on the maintenance of Garda stations. The gardaí occupy 703 Garda stations and other units of accommodation, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters, and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services to the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. I accept Deputy Perry's comments about the importance of having gardaí in the community. Consequently, all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure it meets the operational requirements of the force. Where it does not, necessary works will be prioritised and completed with alacrity.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been carried out in recent years to improve the situation and I am sure Members will all acknowledge the improvements to Garda stations and the building of new stations in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has an obligation to maintain a level of controls that is adequate to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the rural environmental protection scheme. In operating the existing scheme, it has been necessary to carry out a high level of compliance inspections each year. When REPS participants apply for their second or subsequent annual payments, 50% are selected for on-farm inspection and a further 5% are selected for a plan check in addition to an on-farm inspection. I am satisfied that this high level of control has played a vital part in giving assurance to the EU Commission that the scheme is being operated correctly.</P>
      <P>This high level of compliance inspections can, however, have an impact on the time it takes to process payment applications. This is especially the case in areas where the number of REPS participants is higher than average and the operation of various payment schemes places a heavy burden on human and other resources.</P>
      <P>In an effort to optimise levels of customer service while at the same time maintaining an adequate level of control, I am actively considering more sophisticated methods of selecting cases for compliance inspection. It is my intention to apply detailed risk analysis criteria to the selection process and such criteria are being developed at present. I expect the introduction of risk analysis to allow for a reduction in the level of compliance inspections from 50% to 25% and this, together with the provision of additional human and IT resources, will ensure that delays in making payments are minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to penalties, it is a requirement of the European Commission that the REP scheme includes details of types of non-compliance and the penalties they will attract. I have accordingly incorporated proposals relating to penalties in the draft scheme included in the rural development plan 2000-2006, which is now being considered by the Commission. Certain penalties are being increased under the proposed penalty regime, but others are being reduced or abolished. In preparing these proposals, my Department sought the views of the farm bodies, Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants' Association. In introducing <Col N="1554" /> the new scheme, it is my intention to ensure that REPS participants and their planners are informed in the clearest possible terms of their obligations so as to minimise the likelihood of non-compliance.</P>
    <P>I should point out that for the vast majority of the 45,000 participants in the existing scheme, penalties have not been an issue. Penalties are applied only where it is found on inspection that a participant has not complied with the undertakings in his or her REPS plan. Of the £544 million paid to farmers under the scheme to date, penalties have represented only £7.1 million, or 1.3% of the total.</P>

      <P>Most official agricultural and trade statistics do not separate organic products from conventional agricultural products, and consequently the available data on the production and consumption of organic products are limited. However, it is currently estimated that organic food products represent just under 1% of the total food sales in Ireland. There is some evidence that demand for organic food is increasing. Organic production is essentially market-driven and I am satisfied that the level of demand is such as to ensure the continuing growth of organic farming.</P>
      <P>The development of the organic sector is being promoted both directly by my Department and by bodies under the Department's aegis. My Department is providing financial support for the sector through the national development plan and through the rural development plan for the period 2000-06 which is being considered by the European Commission at present. The rural development plan includes proposals for a new rural environmental protection scheme, and these proposals include continuing support for REPS participants who opt to enter organic farming. In addition, the Government has made a provision of £6 million in the national development plan for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the recommendation of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee for the establishment of an organic development committee and arrangements are in hand to establish the committee at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department liaises with Bord Bia and Bord Glas in developing the market potential of the organic sector. Bord Bia, which carries out <Col N="1555" /> ongoing work in relation to surveying, investigating and developing markets and potential markets for food, believes that the Irish organic sector has the potential to become a significant niche within the overall food market. Bord Bia is currently preparing a report on the consumer demand for organic produce within Ireland. This study is being carried out in conjunction with Bord Glas and will be completed shortly. Substantial work is also being done by Teagasc to support the development of the organic sector through research projects, education and training.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision has been made for a scheme of farm waste management and a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards. A significant level of funding amounting to some £216.7 million has been allocated for these measures including £180.9 million for farm waste management and £35.8 million for dairy hygiene.</P>
      <P>These on-farm investment measures will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. Clearance to proceed requires the approval of the European Commission. The broad clearance procedure is already well under way, as negotiations with the European Commission on the community support framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been completed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the various operational programmes required have recently been finalised and submitted to the Commission. The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow and there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. The procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail. As this is likely to continue over a number of months, it is not possible to indicate at this stage, when any of the schemes involved will commence. I will be doing all I can to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, while the EU Commission procedure is in train, work on preparing the operational parameters of the schemes is proceeding. It is intended that the practical aspects of the <Col N="1556" /> design of the schemes will be completed so as to coincide with the issue of approval by the Commission which will enable the prompt roll out and commencement of implementation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the new scheme of investment aid for the scheme of farm waste management will be open to farmers with a minimum of 15 income units from farming and a maximum of 200 income units, including off-farm income. The grant will be calculated at the rate of 40% for farmers having up to 150 income units and the maximum level of grant aid under the scheme is proposed at £16,000. Farmers having 151 income units to 200 income units will be eligible for a 20% grant rate to a maximum of £8,000. Similar eligibility criteria will apply for the new scheme for improvement in dairy hygiene standards, with a maximum grant rate of £10,000 for farmers having up to 150 income units and a maximum grant of £5,000 for farmers having 151 to 200 income units.</P>
    <P>Pending the coming on stream of the schemes, the current national schemes for the control of farm pollution and improvement in dairy hygiene standards will remain in operation and open to applications.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of the rural environment protection scheme was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. This evaluation assessed how the objectives of the scheme have been met, it examined the agricultural, socio-economic and environmental impact of the REPS and it provided practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that the REP scheme to date has shown measurable environmental impacts on participating farms, and its conclusions were favourably received by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Independent consultants were engaged to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and to put together the comprehensive and objective assessment of REPS. Submissions were received from concerned organisations including the Heritage Council, Birdwatch Ireland, Teagasc and the farming organisations. Independent studies were also commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities.</P>
      <P>Participants in REPS are required to follow a nutrient management plan which identifies pollution control facilities on the farm and ensures the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner and sets limits on application rates of fertilisers. The evaluation report found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objective of reducing agriculture's contribution to environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The control of farm pollution scheme was specifically examined by my Department's analysis and evaluation unit which was set up under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, OPARDF. The examination took place as part of an evaluation of the environmental effects of the OPARDF, which was completed in August 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluation found that the management of waste and pollution control facilities is of the utmost importance in preventing pollution and as a consequence in protecting the environment. The evaluation also found that the requirement under the national scheme for the control of farm pollution that applicants are obliged to have a nutrient management plan was a welcome move and should help farmers recognise the full fertiliser value of agricultural manures and slurry and realise the importance of good practice in relation to landspreading. This finding together with the other recommendations regarding improved farmyard pollution control were taken into account by my Department in the context of drafting the terms and conditions of a scheme of farm waste management and a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards for submission to the European Commission for <Col N="1559" /> approval. These schemes are provided for under the agricultural element of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by senior officials of my Department, visited Libya on 8-9 June last and concluded an agreement with the Libyan authorities which, <i>inter alia</i>, provided for a lifting of the ban on the import of live cattle from Ireland. The agreement provides also that Ireland will be officially listed as a source country for all tenders opened by Libya for the supply of live cattle. This satisfactory outcome was the culmination of sustained diplomatic and political contact with the Libyan authorities.</P>
      <P>I myself visited Libya in August 1999 and had detailed and technical discussions with the relevant authorities in relation to the resumption of the cattle trade. The Taoiseach met with Colonel Ghadaffi during the Cairo EU African summit in April last and also raised the matter of the live cattle ban. Normally Libya, which has an annual requirement for up to 200,000 live cattle, issues a tender for cattle supplies in the second half of the year and I would expect, in line with the recently signed agreement, that Ireland will be eligible to submit offers. At that stage it will be a matter for commercial exporters to bid successfully with a view to resuming this traditional trade. My understanding is that Irish cattle should be price competitive in this market.</P>

      <P>The European Union participates in the World Trade Organisation negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The EU negotiating mandate for agriculture was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed subsequently by the General Affairs Council, in preparation for the comprehensive round of negotiations which was to be launched by the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle at the end of last year. The main points of the mandate are the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the principles enshrined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture under the Uruguay Round which recognises &ldquo;that the long-term objective of substantial progressive reductions in support and protection resulting in fundamental reform is an on-going process&rdquo;; the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999; the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the &ldquo;blue and green&rdquo; boxes will continue; the EU is prepared to negotiate reductions in export subsidies provided that all such support, especially export credits and less transparent forms of export support, is treated on an equal basis; similar instruments to the Peace Clause and the Special Safeguard Clause will be needed in the future; an appropriate balance will be sought between trade and non-trade issues; the EU will seek recognition for the multifunctional role of agriculture, and for the EU's high standards of food safety, food quality and animal welfare, and the EU will actively promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO ministerial conference adjourned without reaching agreement on the launch of a new comprehensive round of negotiations. However, Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture requires WTO members to initiate negotiations on agriculture, irrespective of whether a new comprehensive round has been launched. Accordingly, negotiations on agriculture commenced on 24 March, 2000 in Geneva with a special session of the WTO Committee on Agriculture. The Council of Agri<Col N="1561" /> culture Ministers decided at the April council meeting that the negotiating mandate already agreed would apply to these negotiations. The WTO Committee on Agriculture will meet again on 29 and 30 June and in September and November. The period to the end of the year will be taken up with analysis of current issues. The Commission will be submitting position papers on the EU's priorities and concerns. Substantive negotiations are unlikely to get under way until early next year.</P>

      <P>Most official agricultural and trade statistics do not separate organic products from conventional agricultural products, and consequently the available data on the production and consumption of organic products are limited. However, it is currently estimated that organic food products represent just under 1% of the total food sales in Ireland. There is some evidence that demand for organic food is increasing. Organic production is essentially market-driven and I am satisfied that the level of demand is such as to ensure the continuing growth of organic farming.</P>
      <P>The development of the organic sector is being promoted both directly by my Department and also by bodies under the Department's aegis. My Department is providing financial support for the sector through the national development plan and through the rural development plan for the period 2000-2006 which is being considered by the European Commission at present. The rural development plan includes proposals for a new rural environmental protection scheme, and these proposals include continuing support for REP scheme participants who opt to enter organic farming. In addition, the Government has made a provision of £6 million in the national development plan for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the recommendation of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee for the establishment of an organic development committee and arrangements are in hand to establish the committee at an early date.</P>
      <P>My Department liaises with Bord Bia and Bord Glas in developing the market potential of the organic sector. Bord Bia, which carries out ongoing work in relation to surveying, investigating and developing markets and potential markets for food, believes that the Irish organic sector has the potential to become a significant niche within the overall food market. Bord Bia is currently preparing a report on the consumer demand for organic produce within Ireland. This study is being carried out in conjunction with Bord Glas and will be completed shortly. Substantial work is also being done by Teagasc to support the development of the organic sector through research projects, education and training.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision is made for a farm waste management scheme and a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards. A significant level of funding amounting to some £217 million has been allocated for these measures.</P>
      <P>These on-farm investment measures will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. Clearance to proceed requires the approval of the European Commission. The broad clearance procedure is already well under way, as negotiations with the European Commission on the community support framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the various operational programmes required have recently been finalised and submitted to the Commission. The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow and there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. The procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail. As this is likely to continue over a number of months, it is not possible to indicate at this stage, when any of the schemes involved will commence. The Deputy can be assured that I will <Col N="1565" /> be doing all I can to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In that regard, while the EU Commission procedure is in train, work on preparing the operational parameters of the schemes is proceeding. It is intended that the practical aspects of the design of the schemes will be completed so as to coincide with the issue of approval by the Commission, which will enable the prompt roll out and commencement of implementation. Every effort is being made to ensure that the new schemes are up and running as early as possible.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the national schemes for the control of farm pollution and improvement in dairy hygiene standards will remain in operation and open to applications. Farmers approved under these schemes will, over the summer months and beyond, continue with construction works and receive grant payments as the works are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The efforts of Bord Bia in the French market this year have concentrated on promoting Irish lamb using the positive image of the product identified in its research. The initiative is concentrated in the mid-summer, at a time when Irish supplies are at their most plentiful. The promotion involves clearly identifying Irish lamb as a high quality product and marking retail packs with a &ldquo;Lamb from Ireland&rdquo; label. Participating companies must supply lamb according to certain specifications. In addition there will be promotion campaigns in Germany, which is a significant market for Irish lamb, in Spain and Italy. These will include attendance at major food fairs, retail promotions and meetings with buyers. The objective of these campaigns is to secure a better market position and better prices for Irish lamb which are sustainable over a longer period, to support Irish exporters in maintaining strong links with buyers and to promote lamb to younger consumers.</P>
      <P>The response to the campaigns has been very positive. However, they must be seen as the first part of a long-term process to create a recognisable image of Irish lamb, which can improve its market share at the premium retail level. Nonetheless, there is recent evidence that the promotion initiative has contributed to arresting the decline in prices to Irish producers which had been taking place since Easter.</P>

      <P>The specific food-<Col N="1567" /> related initiatives set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 are market-oriented ones. While these are directed at the food industry rather than at its market outlets, they take account of developments in the retail and food services sectors. The total indicative public funding allocation of £282 million will be provided as follows: £120 million for capital investment; £83 million for research, technology and innovation; £48 million for marketing and promotion; and £31 million to address the human resources needs of the food industry.</P>
      <P>In the context of the restaurant sector, Bord Bia continues to work closely with restaurateurs and restaurant organisations at home and abroad. This is in line with the board's overall aim to increase sales of Irish food and drink. The activities undertaken by Bord Bia as part of its marketing and promotion work include seminars for chefs, tailor-made restaurant promotions, and ongoing advisory programmes. The board has, for example, worked closely with the catering industry in preparing the Féile Bia 2000, which will be launched next week. The Féile is an important showcase for Irish cuisine and emphasises the role of the restaurant sector in promoting Irish food and drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of the mechanical grading trial for Irish beef cattle were communicated to the EU Commission last March and were discussed in the beef management committee in March and April in the context of a draft Commission regulation providing for mechanical classification.</P>
      <P>The feedback from these discussions was that the trial was carried out in a highly professional manner and that the three machines tested achieved a relatively high degree of accuracy in relation to conformation and meat yield. However, the machines failed to meet the standards proposed by the Commission in a draft regulation setting down the requirements to be attained by these machines prior to their approval for use in the classification of carcasses. In general, the conclusion was that mechanical classification has very positive potential for future use, but the three machines operated in this trial need to be further developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission now proposes to hold further trials before settling on definitive standards for mechanical classification. My Department has indicated to the Commission that it would like to <Col N="1568" /> undertake one of these trials. In this regard, the EU Commission announced at last week's meeting of the Beef Management Committee that it had selected Germany as the venue for a further trial which will take place next October. My Department intends to press its case for a further trial to be held in Ireland under the Commission's auspices.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an effective mechanical classification system introduced in Ireland as soon as possible, and my Department will continue to work with the developers of these machines to improve their accuracy in classifying carcasses. However the current system of manual classification will remain in place until EU regulations have been amended to allow the use of machines, and until machines have been approved for use in classification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of high quality food of plant origin continues to be dependent on the availability and responsible use of plant protection products. The regulatory system in this country is based on harmonised European Community legislation which requires that all such products be assessed independently before approval is given for their marketing. The pesticide control service of my Department undertakes this evaluation and specific conditions are attached to the use of these products so as to minimise any risk for humans, animals or the environment.</P>
      <P>The European Community has initiated a review of all chemical substances used in plant protection products under Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of these products on to the market. This country is involved in the review, the outcome of which will determine whether any changes are needed in the existing legislation regarding the use of chemical compounds in such products.</P>
      <P>Teagasc operates a number of training and educational courses for farmers and people who are involved in the application and safe use of plant protection products. In addition, Teagasc has published a voluntary code of good practice, which is available to all farmers, on the safe handling, application and storage of pesticides on farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PCS of my Department undertakes a national pesticide monitoring and enforcement programme. The programme is designed to ensure that pesticide residues in food do not exceed the maximum residue limits established in statutory regulations. Results of the monitoring <Col N="1569" /> programme show that the level of residues is very low. These results are published annually.</P>
    <P>The availability and use of veterinary medicines is governed by strict national legislation derived largely from relevant EU directives. All veterinary medicines must be authorised prior to being placed on the market. Each medicine is designated a route of supply consistent with the degree of control appropriate to the product. Withdrawal periods are established to avoid consumers being exposed to harmful residues. Farmers are required to keep detailed records of the use of medicines for which a withdrawal period has been established.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department carries out an extensive animal residue surveillance programme covering a range of substances. Since the beginning of 2000 for the first time, primary processors are required to carry out their own checks on the basis plan approved by my Department.  This system operates independently of and in addition to official testing.</P>

      <P>CSO figures for average agricultural land prices show a clear rising trend, while the total area of land sold has decreased in recent years. In the third quarter of 1999 the average price of agricultural land rose to £9,541 per hectare, an increase of 20% over the previous quarter. The increase in price reflects, at least to some extent, the increasing scarcity of agricultural land being put up for sale. Only 1,248 hectares of agricultural land were sold in the third quarter of 1999, a decline of 47% over the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>Increases in land prices can be seen in a number of other EU member states. According to EUROSTAT figures, between 1990 and 1998 agricultural land prices rose in real terms by 44% in Ireland, 28% in Denmark, 20% in the Netherlands and 119% in Northern Ireland. However, land prices in Ireland in 1998 were still less than those in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and England, and only 60% of the average price in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Ireland's CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06 was submitted to the European Commission at the end of December last. This plan covers REPS along with early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with the Commission are taking place on the plan as a whole, and the entire plan will have to be approved before any of the four individual measures can commence. These negotiations are now in their final stage. However once they are complete, there is a standard formal procedure for approval of all plans that has to take place and by its nature this exercise involves a considerable amount of detail and documentation. It is my objective to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time but it is too early at this stage to give any concrete dates for the likely commencement of the new REP scheme.</P>
      <P>The proposed new REP scheme is closely modelled on the existing scheme, in accordance with the recommendation in the evaluation report furnished to the European Commission in July 1999. Some increase in the basic rate of payment is proposed where smaller farms are involved. I am also seeking the Commission's agreement to arrangements which would allow farmers with a small area of lands in an environmentally sensitive target area to get REPS payments for those lands, without having to put their non-target lands in REPS. The objective of this proposal is to maximise the area of environmentally sensitive land farmed to the REPS specification. Some smaller changes to certain supplementary measures are also envisaged.</P>

    <P>While I am hopeful that the various proposals in the rural development plan will get the approval of the commission, until the commission's final decision is available I cannot say <Col N="1573" /> categorically what the terms and conditions will be.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, I have made provision for a scheme of farm waste management. A significant level of funding amounting to some £180.9 million has been allocated for this measure.</P>
      <P>The measure will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region.

The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programme will follow and there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. The procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the arrangements for the distribution of the additional milk allocated to Ireland under Agenda 2000. Ireland received 32 million gallons additional quota under the Agenda 2000 agreement. Of this, 20.5 million gallons is available in the 2000-01 milk year and the remainder, 11.5 million gallons in the 2001-02 milk year.</P>
      <P>The role of the milk quota review group is an advisory one and I did, of course, take its recommendations into consideration in deciding on the allocation of this quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of <Col N="1575" /> milk quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 were set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999. Some 15 million gallons have already been allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. The co-operatives have been notified of the allocation to each successful applicant.</P>
    <P>A further 5 million gallons is being allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect.</P>
    <P>The completed application forms have been received through the co-operatives-dairies and are being examined by my Department to establish eligibility and to calculate the quantity of additional quota to be allocated to each eligible applicant.</P>
    <P>My Department will endeavour to have the individual allocations made as early as possible and all applicants will be notified of the outcome of their applications. The additional quota allocated will be available to producers for use within the quota year beginning on 1 April.</P>
    <P>I will announce details in due course for the allocation of the remaining 500,000 gallons that has been set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>
    <P>No decision has been made regarding the distribution of quota becoming available under Agenda 2000 during the next milk year.</P>
    <P>I have also published the rules for the sale of quota from this year's quota restructuring scheme. In establishing the priority categories under that scheme it was important to take account of the particular situation which exists in the current year which is a transitional one from one quota regime to another. For that reason, 85% of the available pool is being set aside for those producers who have been dependent on temporary leasing in recent years and for producers who held quota under land leases which, for reasons beyond their control, they can not now renew. It is clear to me that these are the two categories of producers whose needs are greatest and who would, in the absence of priority access to quota, be in the most vulnerable position. In setting the priority categories I took full account of the advice of the milk quota review group and it is my view that the arrangements which have been put in place are best suited to meet the specific requirements of the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that a new area based compensatory allowance scheme is to be introduced with effect from 2001 as part of the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations and in particular to protect the future of these payments in the context of WTO. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate proposals for a new scheme and to ensure an orderly transition. The task force met on a number of occasions and having considered a range of options the group recommended a scheme which would involve a payment per hectare linked to the type of livestock on the holding. The proposals envisaged a one hectare payment for each livestock unit. I announced details of the proposed scheme, including an increase in the overall headage grant limit from £4,000 to £5,000 on 29 May last. I also announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments for the period 2000-06. The allocation for sheep headage would almost double to £40 million annually.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with officials of my Department, the European Commission was not satisfied with aspects of the scheme being proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The fact that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment was seen as continuing the link to production.</P>
      <P>The task now is to devise a scheme which is best suited to our requirements and which meets with Commission approval. Earlier this week, I personally raised the issue with Commissioner Fischler and had direct consultations with him on the matter when I attended the EU Farm Council meeting in Luxembourg. My officials are in continuing contact with the Commission with a view to devising an alternative proposal. Further consultation is also taking place with the farming bodies with a view to formulating such a scheme.</P>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is operating, with other State agencies under service contracts with the FSAI with regard to its food safety activities. This arrangement is working well and is contributing to the overall objective that Ireland should be at the forefront of food safety and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent campylobacter seminar hosted by the food and safety authority at Trinity College, at which scientific experts drew attention to the high levels of campylobacter infection in Ireland. Among the identified causes of this infection is the consumption of undercooked chicken.</P>
      <P>While there are high levels of campylobacter in raw chicken, cooking kills this bacteria. It is therefore important that chicken should be well-cooked before consumption and that care is taken to avoid transferring the germs to other cooked foods or non cooked foods.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by senior officials of my Department, visited Libya on 8-9 June last and concluded an agreement with the Libyan authorities which,<i> inter alia</i>, provided for a lifting of the ban on the import of live cattle from Ireland. The agreement provides also that Ireland will be officially listed as a source country for all tenders opened by Libya for the supply of live cattle. This satisfactory outcome was the culmination of sustained diplomatic and political contact with the Libyan authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I myself visited Libya in August 1999 and had detailed and technical discussions with the relevant authorities in relation to the resumption of the cattle trade. The Taoiseach met with Colonel Ghadaffi during the Cairo EU African summit in April last and also raised the matter of the live cattle ban. Normally Libya, which has an annual requirement for up to 200,000 live cattle, issues a tender for cattle supplies in the second half of the year and I would expect, in line with the recently signed agreement, that Ireland will be eligible to submit offers. At that stage it will be a matter for commercial exporters to bid successfully with a view to resuming this traditional trade. My understanding is that Irish cattle should be price competitive in this market.</P>

      <P>The most recent quarterly national household survey conducted by the CSO shows employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing to be at the same level as that during the corresponding period, December-February in 1998. This period tends to show employment at its lowest level with higher employment levels coming, as might be expected, in the summer months.</P>
      <P>This survey is based on the ILO system, which determines employment on the basis of principal economic status of the person interviewed. Thus, farmers or farm workers for whom off-farm employment provided a greater proportion of their income would have their employment recorded under the off-farm category.</P>
      <P>The long-term trend in on-farm employment is one of gradual decline. This situation, however, is not unique to Ireland. The numbers of farmers have been in decline across the EU as a whole for many years. Significantly, there is growth in the number of farmers who have off-farm employment, which is a very important factor in the context of overall rural employment.</P>
      <P>With regard to rural communities, the latest figures available, the 1996 census, show that the rural population has been reasonably stable at around 1.5 million since the 1980s, and accounts for 42% of total population. The White Paper on Rural Development, which was published last August, sets out a vision and a framework for the development of sustainable rural communities. The national development plan gives substance to the commitments in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>I am aware that tourism has considerable potential for the future development of rural areas. It combines well with agriculture in supporting population levels by providing supplementary income and stimulating enterprises, thus improving the local economy and the quality of life of rural communities. Tourism also provides the wider rural community with <Col N="1581" /> a mechanism for integrated community development.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the future development of the rural tourism sector. Overall £6.7 billion has been provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for programmes and measures which will have a direct impact on rural areas. In so far as local development activity is provided for in the plan, some £58 million has been allocated for a Leader mainstream type programme and it is proposed that future funding from my Department for rural tourism including agri-tourism will be provided as part of this programme.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department is currently preparing the operational programmes for the implementation of Leader programmes for submission to the European Commission with a view to obtaining clearance and prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006.</P>
      <P>In the meantime my Department is consulting the various bodies involved in the tourism sector including officials of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation regarding the future needs of rural tourism and with a view to ensuring a consistent approach to the development of rural tourism product by agencies operating at local and regional level. The final shape of proposals for the sector including the operating rules cannot be settled until the Commission approves the Leader programmes. My Department is committed to the further development of rural tourism in the context of overall national tourism policy so as to maximise its contribution to the economic and social development of rural areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by senior officials of my Department, visited Libya on 8-9 June last and concluded an agreement with the Libyan authorities which, <i>inter alia</i>, provided for a lifting of the ban on the import of live cattle from Ireland. The agreement provides also that Ireland will be officially listed as a source country for all tenders opened by Libya for the supply of live cattle. This satisfactory outcome was the culmination of sustained diplomatic and political contact with the Libyan authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited Libya in August 1999 and had detailed and technical discussions with the relevant authorities in relation to the resumption of the cattle trade. The Taoiseach met Colonel Gadaffi during the Cairo EU/African Summit in April last and also raised the matter of the live cattle ban. Normally Libya, which has an annual requirement for up to 200,000 live cattle, issues a tender for cattle <Col N="1582" /> supplies in the second half of the year and I would expect, in line with the recently signed agreement, that Ireland will be eligible to submit offers. At that stage it will be a matter for commercial exporters to bid successfully with a view to resuming this traditional trade. My understanding is that Irish cattle should be price competitive in this market.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Rural Development sets out a vision and a framework for the development of rural communities and marks a new approach and commitment by Government to rural development. One of the concerns is of course to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside. To maintain viable rural communities we must exploit our natural advantages and potential to the full in the creation of more opportunities for enterprise both on and off farm.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure that the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development, and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, the National Rural Development Forum, which was established following publication of the White Paper met for the first time. The forum was established to debate current issues, to review existing programmes and to identify suitable policy responses to rural problems. Among the topics discussed at the forum were the spatial spread of development, the transition to part-time farming especially for low-income smallholders, rural poverty, rural transport and planning permission for houses in rural areas. Issues such as rural infrastructure, income supports, rural transport and the environment will be discussed at future meetings.</P>
      <P>The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of £6.7 billion over the next seven years in actions which directly impact on rural areas. Many of the other investments proposed in the plan will also have indirect benefits for rural communities such as employment development, better roads, new housing and improved health services.</P>

      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion <Col N="1586" /> of occupational health and safety legislation is a day-to-day matter for the national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The proper management of workplace health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 General Application Regulations and the 1995 Construction Regulations all provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can and should be managed. Good management of health and safety on a day-to-day basis is the responsibility of the employer in the same way as quality management or financial management comes within the remit of an employer.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I secured Government sanction to allow the authority to increase its staff numbers in 2000. Of 20 new inspectors being recruited by the authority, nine are intended for assignment to the construction sector. These additional resources will be a valuable asset and the authority plans to be able to double the rate of construction industry site inspections by the end of this year. I also secured additional funding for the authority for this year to enable it to undertake awareness-raising activities with regard to workplace health and safety and some of this campaign will be specifically targeted at the construction sector.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, that the activity of the authority is but one element in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation, from all sides, is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. Nowhere is this more vital than in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>Such a partnership approach is the construction safety partnership which I launched in October last year and which resulted in turn in the launch of the construction safety partnership plan on 28 February 2000. The plan focuses on improved worker safety representation on site, safety training for all in the industry, structured skills training and other measures. These measures, will be strongly supported and implemented under the guidance of the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, FÁS, the Health and Safety Authority and the other participants in the construction safety partnership. It is recommended that these measures become mandatory in the future. It is intended that all workers in the construction sector will be covered by the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the plan is based on a partnership approach, all the parties to the plan will be contributing as appropriate to its implementation. The partnership will meet on a quarterly basis initially during the first year of the plan to <Col N="1587" /> oversee the implementation of the recommendations as well as provide a policy focus for other related consultative structures in the industry.</P>

      <P>There are no harmonised EU controls on licensed production agreements related to arms manufacturing. However, any transfer of technology related to military items specified in the Control of Exports Order, 1996, would be subject to national export licence requirements. Similarly, an export of any specially designed parts or components related to the licensed production of military goods would also be controlled.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland does not have an arms industry, a very small number of companies manufacture products and components which are primarily for military use and, as such, are subject to export control. While I have no reason to believe Irish companies avail of licensed production agreements to avoid our export controls system, I would, in principle, support the introduction of uniform controls on licensed production within the EU.</P>

      <P>The use of no claims bonus, NCB, schemes by insurers is universal throughout the EU and is not subject to state regulation. The format of a NCB certificate can vary across different insurance companies with some giving a full history of claims if applicable while others simply certify that the policyholder is in possession of a NCB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the basis of the insurance contract is the proposal form drawn up by the insurer and signed by the insured. There is an obligation on the insured to complete this proposal form accurately and honestly to the best of their ability as non-disclosure of material facts <Col N="1588" /> on a proposal form is a serious issue and can result in a policy being revoked.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember, in the context of disclosure, that possession of a NCB certificate does not imply, and should not be interpreted as being equivalent to having, a claims free history. For example, an individual may have a short history of claims and, by virtue of having protection on their NCB, possess a NCB certificate.</P>
    <P>Regulations to introduce greater transparency into insurance transactions will be introduced by me, as soon as practicable, following enactment of the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The policy on prices followed by this Government, and by all Governments since price controls were abandoned in the 1980s, is that prices should be set by competition in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>To ensure that competition operates in the marketplace, the Competition Authority is charged with fostering competition in all sectors of the economy and combating anti-competitive practices. The Tánaiste recently approved five additional posts for the authority, two economists and three lawyers, which will increase the authority's professional staffing level by approximately 70%. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that competition law is vigorously enforced and that competition operates to the benefit of consumers.</P>
      <P>While there may be a case for regulating prices where competition either does not operate or is restricted, such a situation does not generally obtain where retail outlets are concerned. I do not propose therefore to change the existing, long-standing policy on prices.</P>

My responsibility in this regard is concerned with the labelling and marketing of fertilisers. Official samples of fertilisers held at manufacturers' and retailers' premises are routinely taken by my Department's inspectors. The samples are analysed to determine whether the material complies with the statutory requirements in relation to the levels of nutrients present.

      <P>Negotiations with the Commission began in March and are now in their final stage. Following the completion of these negotiations a standard formal procedure for approval of all plans has to take place and, by its nature, this exercise involves a considerable amount of detail and documentation.

These measures will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. The programmes have been submitted to the European Commission for approval. The negotiation process with the European Commission is expected to take a number of months and, consequently, the measures are unlikely to come on stream until later in the year.

      <P>The position in relation to bovine TB is that significantly higher numbers of reactors were disclosed throughout the country in 1998 and 1999 than in preceding years. Simultaneously, there has also been increased levels of the disease in parts of Britain and Northern Ireland. Veterinary experts both here and in the UK have not yet established the precise reasons for these increases but among the factors considered to be involved are the cyclical nature of the disease, higher cattle numbers, higher stocking densities, poor weather conditions, some fraud and infected wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of reactors disclosed to date in 2000 is below that for the comparable period in 1999, the current high level of TB is not sus<Col N="1593" /> tainable for a variety of reasons, including potential risks to human and animal health, trading implications, production losses, the disruption of normal farming activities and the budgetary implications for Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>As agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, measures are being adopted with the objective of reducing the current levels of TB by 50% over the next four years. These measures include additional resources being made available for the removal of infected wildlife in the 20% of the country that yields 50% of reactors. The operational arrangements are being finalised with the farming and veterinary bodies in the context of the animal health forum.</P>

      <P>A number of additional measures have been added to the brucellosis eradication programme in recent years including the introduction from February 1998 of a compulsory one sale, 30 day pre-movement test. During the course of 1999, I introduced a number of new initiatives in order to further enhance the eradication programme. These included the taking of blood samples from cows at slaughter plants and other diagnostic measures. In addition the milk ring test, MRT, is being replaced by the milk elisa test and the serum agglutination test, SAT, on blood samples is being replaced by the elisa test. These improved tests are helping to identify brucellosis breakdowns at an earlier stage, allowing for earlier intervention in herds and reducing the risk of contiguous spread. The current regime was reviewed during 1999 by an EU Food and Veterinary Office mission and its report broadly endorsed the measures in place.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that as a result of these initiatives a number of positive factors are emerging to indicate that the incidence of this disease is declining. I am keeping a close eye on developments and will introduce further changes in consultation with the farming and veterinary organisations, if, and as they become necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Single Market rules prohibit member states from compelling retailers to give preferential treatment to domestically produced goods. While it may be the case that, for various reasons, some Irish food companies are not in a position to meet the requirements of the non-national chain stores, I am not aware of any instances of unfair or inequitable treatment of companies by those stores. The proof of this can be seen in the fact that in the past six years sales of Irish produced food on the home market increased by over £1 billion.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the Irish food industry can maintain and expand this market position will be contingent on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and its capability in this context, will, I believe, be underscored by the food-related provisions of the national development plan. The NDP provides for specific support measures that take account of the explicit requirements identified in the report of the food industry development group. These cover the key priority areas of food safety-quality, market access and competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Irish pork and bacon is exported to around 60 countries within the EU and worldwide. The major EU markets include the UK, Germany, Italy and France. The opening up of the Swedish market in 1998-99 represented an important step in the development of this business. Approximately 10% of total pork production is to third countries.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of WTO Irish exporters have increased access to a number of new non-EU markets, especially in the Far East. In 1999 exports to the Japanese market increased and it is likely that there will be a further increase in 2000. In this region, the principal new markets are South Korea, China and the Philippines. In 1999 Ireland's exports to Russia increased considerably following the collapse of that market in 1998. No markets have been lost by Irish exporters in that period.</P>

There has been little change in this figure over the past five years. Exports to other markets, including Germany and Belgium, have increased slightly over the same period. No markets have been lost.

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease &ndash; CJD &ndash; is the collective name for a group of diseases which cause progressive dementia and a loss of control of movement and balance. The overall incidence of CJD is approximately one case per million per year. However, this has increased in recent years. This increase is most likely due to active surveillance which has been established in many countries as well as improvements in diagnosis.</P>
      <P>There are four types of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease. Sporadic CJD, the most common, usually affects individuals between the age of 50 and 75 years and is characterised by a rapidly progressive dementia. Familial CJD is an inherited disease associated with a gene mutation. Iatrogenic CJD results from transmission of a causative agent via medical or surgical treatment using accidentally contaminated materials, e.g., surgical instruments. New variant CJD &ndash; VCJD &ndash; is a new disease which was first described in March 1996.</P>
      <P>Experimental evidence now indicates the VCJD and BSE are caused by the same agent. Brain tissue from VCJD patients show similar features to animals experimentally infected with the BSE agent. The source of infection remains to be established. The most likely explanation is the ingestion by humans of BSE contaminated food during the height of the epidemic in the UK prior to the implementation of the ban on specified bovine offals in the human food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Scientific Steering Committee &ndash; SSC &ndash; of the European Union considers that a safe product can be offered to consumers if what is already scientifically known about BSE is correctly exploited in a logical order and provided that the resulting risk management measures are properly enforced and controlled. The SSC recently reaffirmed its original analysis that the removal from the food chain of specified risk materials would significantly decrease the risk of <Col N="1599" /> VCJD. The agent of BSE is concentrated in the brain and spinal cord of cattle and the use of these tissues in the production of food has been prohibited in Ireland for many years.</P>
    <P>In 1997, following a risk assessment exercise, the United Kingdom authorities decided to ban the sale of beef on the backbone. This ban was lifted in 1999. Even though Irish BSE controls are substantially different from those in the UK and involve the slaughter and destruction of the complete herd in which a BSE case is found, as well as the slaughter of cohort animals, it has recently been decided that a risk assessment similar to that undertaken in the UK would be carried out in Ireland. The scientific sub-committee on BSE of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland will oversee this risk assessment exercise. The sub-committee is expected to submit a report of its findings to both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development within a number of months.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, a system of active surveillance has been established to detect new cases of CJD. In 1999 there was one case of sporadic CJD in Ireland and one case of VCJD.</P>
    <P>The CJD advisory group was established in September 1996 to advise the Minister for Health and Children on all issues relating to CJD, and to provide advice on particular issues referred to the group from time to time by the Minister. Included in the terms of reference of the advisory group is the surveillance of CJD in Ireland, the assessment of scientific developments, both nationally and internationally, with regard to the risks to public health concerning transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents &ndash; TSEs &ndash; and CJD, and the provision of advice on research strategies for bovine spongiform encephalopathy &ndash; BSE &ndash; CJD. The chairman of the group is Professor William Hall, virologist, Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, and the group comprises experts in, <i>inter alia</i>, public health, neuro-pathology, haematology, food safety and veterinary science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, each health board has a statutory obligation to provide an adoption service. As a result of changing trends in adoption, this service now includes tracing and reunion services. While this service is currently provided by health boards it is also being provided by voluntary registered adoption agencies, which are part-funded by the health boards, and the Adoption Board. Barnardos and other voluntary groups working in the area of adoption also provide an adoption advice service for those wishing to trace and be reunited with a blood relative and have recently received once-off funding for this purpose.</P>
      <P>My Department issued a questionnaire on tracing and reunion services to health boards in the spring of this year. Based on the information returned, it is estimated that in the year 1999 there were over 100 social workers involved, to varying degrees, in the provision of tracing and reunion services in the health boards. The tracing and reunion service delivered by the social workers in the health boards is usually encompassed within their overall caseload which may include, for example, domestic and intercountry adoption, fostering and in some cases child protection work. In terms of whole time equivalent posts it is estimated that approximately ten social workers are engaged in this work in the health boards. Of the tracing and reunion requests received by health boards and registered adoption societies last year over 60% were received by the registered adoption societies and health boards received approximately 40%.</P>
      <P>The provision of a tracing and reunion service is currently unregulated, however, I am pleased to advise Deputy Owen that work is nearing completion in the Department's child care legislation unit on the preparation of legislation in the very complex area of adoption information, post-adoption contact and associated issues. The scheme of a Bill will be circulated to all relevant Departments for their observations in the very near future. This legislation will provide for, among other issues, the regulation of tracing and reunion service.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to discussions which my Department is holding with the relevant professional bodies on a possible scheme of statutory registration. A workshop on statutory registration was held on 14 April 2000 and an invitation was issued to the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists of Ireland to attend. The invitation was sent to the society's registered office, but apparently was not received by the organisation. Consequently, a separate meeting was organised by officials of my Department with officers of the society, and the society has been involved in the two subsequent workshops. I am committed to the full participation of all of the relevant professional bodies in the process.</P>
      <P>With regard to equality of services, the health boards provide chiropody services through a panel of private practitioners on the basis of three treatments per annum to medical card holders over 65 years of age who require such a service.

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. The most recent anti-smoking campaign Break the Habit for Good emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and was launched in December 1998 in association with the Irish Cancer Society. The campaign involves national and local initiatives which offer support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>
      <P>In relation specifically to younger people and young girls, the health promotion unit of my Department has co-ordinated two school programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking in the first instance. The smoking reduction action programme &ndash; SCRAP &ndash; is a peer led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The smokebusters project, which is aimed at primary school children aged seven to 11 years in an urban environment, was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Acting against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, in association with the health promotion unit of my Department, on 22 May launched a teenage anti-smoking campaign aimed specifically at young girls. This is a high profile multi-media campaign incorporating television, posters and print media, encouraging young girls to quit smoking. The provision of special support services through the national Quitline, which is run from the Irish Cancer Society, is another important component of this campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Building Healthier Hearts and Towards a Tobacco Free Society highlighted the importance of discouraging children and young girls from taking up the habit of tobacco use and of helping those who have started to quit. I brought forward a composite Health Bill, which among other things, will raise the age limit at which tobacco <Col N="1604" /> products can be sold to people from 16 to 18 years and increase fines for those convicted of an offence from £500 to £1,500, the maximum amount allowable for this type of offence. The Bill has passed all Stages in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is now appropriate to carry out a comprehensive review of all legislation in the area of tobacco. On my instructions a comprehensive new tobacco Bill is being prepared in my Department and I will give priority to the introduction of the new Bill. I am hopeful that these measures, coupled with the increase of 50p per packet, will deter young people, particularly young girls, from taking up the habit of smoking.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the problem of homeless young people under the age of 18 is most acute in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. Based on information received from the authority it is estimated that at least 400 young people are out of home in any one year.</P>
      <P>In general, when homeless young people come to the attention of the area health boards, every effort is made to reunite them with their families or to arrange to have them placed in foster care or residential care as appropriate. Social work support, advice, information and counselling to include counselling for families and individuals is offered.</P>
      <P>A range of services are provided in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area including supported lodgings for approximately 200 placements, emergency carers providing special fostering for young people in crisis, hostels, emergency accommodation, day services, for example, St. Vincent's Trust (training) and outreach programmes. An additional £1 million was provided in 1999 for special initiatives involving the voluntary sector to tackle youth homelessness. These initiatives include a residential service, a night reception centre and an after care service with the Salvation Army, an after care service with Don Bosco, a day reception programme with Focus Ireland, transitional care for homeless girls with Focus Ireland and residential care for children under 16 with St. Jude's Trust for Homeless Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has identified young people out of home as one of the key issues it has to address. The authority launched an action plan to tackle youth homelessness in April this year in response to the report of the forum on youth homelessness. The plan includes: the provision of multi-disciplinary teams to target young people at risk and/or out of home; funding for a new centre for young people who are out of home and abusing drugs; <Col N="1605" /> opening a number of local residential centres; contracting of GPs to provide primary health care services for young people who are out of home; specific assignment of psychological and psychiatric service to this group; increased access to drug treatment centres; expansion of aftercare services; commissioning of database to track progress of young people; evaluation of crisis intervention service and out of hours service; and the establishment of a provider forum.</P>
    <P>My Department has provided £1.5 million to the authority for the implementation of the first phase of the plan this year.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently preparing a national strategy on youth homelessness. It aims to set out a framework for a more strategic and planned approach to address youth homelessness. Work on the plan is proceeding as quickly as possible with view to being finalised by the end of the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Department of Health Cervical Screening Committee was launched as part of the national cancer strategy in March 1997. The main thrust of the report is that cervical screening is a worthwhile preventive health measure when delivered as part of an organised screening programme. The report recommends, among other things, the introduction of a national organised screening programme for women in the 25-60 age group at minimum intervals of five years.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the recommendations of this report the national cervical screening programme is being introduced on a phased basis. It is anticipated that phase I of the programme will commence in October this year in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase I will involve 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Cervical screening will be provided free to <Col N="1606" /> women involved in phase I of the programme initially, and to all women on the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. An expert advisory committee on cervical screening is overseeing the implementation of phase I. In addition, the committee's remit extends to providing advice on developments regarding best practice including qualify assurance and new technologies, development of protocols, etc., and in relation to the extension of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The process of planning and organising the phased introduction of the national programme will be greatly facilitated by the experience gained in phase I.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the eastern, north eastern and midland health board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. Limited screening commenced in both units in March 2000 without publicity to test equipment, systems and procedures. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phases II and III will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recom<Col N="1607" /> mended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>My Department is conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the National Cancer Forum. I have received the report of this group, which I am considering. I propose to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop symptomatic breast cancer services further.</P>
    <P>My Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The Department's key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 34, 122 <Col N="1611" /> and 130 of 6 April 2000 and Question No. 197 of 24 May 2000.</P>
    <P>Regarding the reply to Question No. 197 of 24 May 2000 concerning air pollution in Leixlip, I confirm that while sulphur dioxide &ndash; SO2 &ndash; levels recorded in 1998-99 were the highest nationally, they remain fully in compliance with relevant national and EU air quality standards. On a precautionary basis I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency is currently assisting Kildare County Council in endeavouring to identify the reasons for the relatively high levels. Since additional agency and council monitors were installed in May 2000, I also understand that the recorded levels of SO2 have been low and consistent with other monitored urban areas nationally. The increased levels of monitoring will continue over the coming months to determine the cause of the anomalous readings and of any possible recurrence of higher SO2 levels should this occur.</P>
    <P>In terms of improving urban air quality, I recently announced the extension of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal to five new urban areas, including Leixlip, to commence in October 2000. Based on the success of similar bans in other areas, this measure should have a beneficial impact on Leixlip.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension are already very flexible and make it relatively easy for a widow/er to qualify for a payment. For instance, to satisfy the yearly average conditions, a widow(er)'s entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. A widow or widower may qualify on either his-her own or the late spouse's insurance record; in addition, social insurance contributions paid or credited under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may be used to satisfy the requirement that 156 contributions are paid. In the circumstances, there are no plans at present to alter the qualifying conditions. However, the position will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>A widow(er)'s non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for a contributory pension. Those with children may qualify for the one-parent family payment. Both schemes are subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>The child and student admission charges for the Dúchas sites under the control of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands are at the same rate. Generally, this rate of admission charge is approximately 40% of the adult rate of admission. There are other conditions pertaining to this rate. Children up to five years of age are allowed complimentary admission. Children of six to 18 years are charged the child-student rate and students in full time education with a valid-current student card qualify for the child-student rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dúchas also operates a family rate which applies to a group of two adults and a reasonable number of children under 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>From 1 January this year, the Minister introduced free admission to Dúchas sites, subject to certain conditions, for pupils following the primary school curriculum or the secondary-vocational-community school curriculum approved by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and ten mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 294 as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher for travellers, a teacher for the mildly mentally handicapped, and a speech and language teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 268. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment entitles the school to nine mainstream class teachers. The enrolment requirement for the retention of the tenth teacher is 270. Unfortunately, I cannot authorise the retention of the post.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that an inspector has been in touch with the school with regard to class sizes. The inspector has confirmed that the school's fourth class consists of 37 pupils in the current school year. However, it has also emerged that other classes in the school have much smaller numbers of pupils, including one class consisting <Col N="1620" /> of 23 pupils. In the circumstances, I regret that there is no basis whereby additional teaching posts can be sanctioned for this school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the improvements in the staffing schedule last year were introduced to significantly reduce the number of large classes in primary schools. Teacher allocations were granted specifically to ensure that all schools would operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils. The organisation of classes within the school is a matter for the school authorities, who are expected to take whatever steps are necessary to meet the 30 pupil objective.</P>
