      <P>I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Enda Kenny. I call on Deputy Kenny to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate an urgent matter of national importance, namely, the consequences of an announcement made outside Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands concerning the privatisation of the national television transmission network, in view of its consequences for the public service remit of RTE and the disastrous consequences of a further 12 month delay in the advent of digital television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. a19, Finance Bill, 2000 &ndash; Financial Resolutions (Nos. 1 &ndash; 39); No. 19, Finance Bill, 2000 &ndash; Allocation of Time Motion for Select Committee; No. 43b, Motion re: Placing of Contingent of Permanent Defence Force under Authority of UNTAET; No. 5, Social Welfare Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 44, Statements on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. a19, 19 and 43b shall be decided without debate, and in the case of No. a19, Financial Resolutions, Nos. 1 &ndash; 39 shall be moved together and decided by one <Col N="294" /> Question which shall be put from the Chair; (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 44: (i) the opening statement of the Taoiseach and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other member shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. a19, 19, and 93b agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste agree to a change in the Financial Resolutions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the credit unions, will that be made known to the House when these issues are being taken? Will the Taoiseach be able to get the Minister for Finance to go along with whatever he promises the credit unions? It is important we know what is promised today and whether the Minister for Finance will take instruction from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Finance, he will give a report on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear what the Taoiseach said. The Minister for Finance broke his silence and wanted to say something. I thought it might be useful to the debate if he were to tell us that he now intends to go to the meeting with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. Is that what the Minister is trying to tell us? Is the Minister going to the meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the question that the proposal for dealing with Nos. a19, 19 and 93 be agreed. Is it agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 44 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We sought to have this matter debated and the Government agreed. The Order has now been altered because of an interpretation of precedent which I want to draw to the attention of the House. It is unlikely we will have the full 55 minutes this afternoon if Question Time overruns or there are constraints on time. However, the Office of the Ceann Comhairle has interpreted that anything referred to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is automatically excluded from being the subject of a parliamentary question at any stage, so long as that item stays on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That cannot be debated now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be debated now. There is no place else to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining to the House why we are reluctantly agreeing to this restriction. It was on our observation of this point last night at the Whips' meeting that the Government Chief Whip, having confirmed our interpretation, was obliged to terminate a debate which, of its nature, will be confined effectively to three party spokespersons, excluding other parties and Deputies who want to participate. The nation is to vote on this within the various trade unions and, because of self-imposed rules in this House, for which the Chair is not responsible, but the interpretation of which is a function of his Office, we are now prevented from debating it adequately. That makes a mockery of democracy, whatever about partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies by precedent when the statement is taken and there are questions in the one week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, why is there provision on the agenda for a debate on railways but we can ask questions on railways? Why can we ask questions on railways but not on this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to No. 44 in the light of the restricted time. Deputy Quinn called it &ldquo;restriction&rdquo;, but it is strangulation in the case of the Green Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for decision by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Chair to bear in mind that this is not a debate in any sense of the word. My question to the Taoiseach has been ruled out in anticipation of a debate in which I am denied participation. Will the Chair deal with that matter and have it put back to be considered for a longer debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be able to instruct his Minister for Finance to agree to anything that he agrees with the credit unions, so that <Col N="296" /> it will be included in the Financial Resolutions of the Finance Bill? Will he actually obey the Taoiseach this time, even though he will not go to the meeting? I want to know if the Minister for Finance will be made to fulfil any agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are obviously at a very sensitive stage in Northern Ireland and nobody in the House wants to add to the tension there. However, I would like to know the Taoiseach's view of the statement by Mr. Adams that the time for his party being a messenger on arms is almost over. If there is not a link between Sinn Féin and its role in convincing &ndash; as the Good Friday Agreement obliges it to &ndash; the IRA to hand over its weapons, that is a very serious state of affairs. Does the Taoiseach have anything he wishes to inform the House about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reply to any specific statement other than to say that both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties, and I hope all parties, are doing all they can. Discussions and consultations are still going on at all levels, although there has not been a particular breakthrough. However, we are determined to keep at it until we find a way of dealing with this issue. Arms, demilitarisation and all the other issues are still on the agenda and we will continue to consult and discuss until we find a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether the Government and the British Government have given any further thought to the proposal I made yesterday in the House that all of the parties to the agreement should be convened by both Governments and, in addition, that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be reconvened in Dublin Castle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously examining that matter but it is a question of timing. If there is no immediate progress which, quite frankly, I do not think there will be, then we should look at that, and I will consult the party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate matter, No. 108 on the Order Paper, is a technical motion that is required to be moved in Government time without debate in order for us to move a Private Members' Bill, one of the effects of which would be to enable the Government to give immediate aid relief to Mozambique, whose plight we heard about this morning on <i>Morning Ireland</i>. I wonder if, because of the interpretation of the legislation by the Ceann Comhairle's office, it would be possible for the Government to give consideration to this technical motion, which would pave the way for this Private Members' Bill to be debated on Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there will be a meeting shortly on some technical issues and, as <Col N="297" /> I said the other day, the Government is looking at that matter. That item will be on the agenda so that we can consider whether that or some other means can be used to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify that matter. The net point is that if the Taoiseach allows No. 108, to be moved without debate, it will enable the Labour Party to use its Private Members' time to introduce a Bill that would have the effect of increasing our development co-operation aid up to the figure of 0.7% of GNP. We are prohibited by the rules of the House from moving such a Bill unless it is cleared technically at this stage. I am simply asking for the matter to be put on the Order of Business by the Government so that it can be taken without debate and we can thus be facilitated. That does not require a special committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that we are looking at it. Deputy Quinn says it is a simple matter, but it is not, because the effect of it would be&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not a simple matter. It would have the effect of allowing a Private Members' Bill to raise money, and that has not ever been the practice. It is a money Bill and that is prohibited under the rules. The effect would be a major and substantial change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach worried that the Independent Deputies will desert him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a simple matter so do not try to portray it as such. It will be examined and discussed by the relevant committee shortly.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the substantial improvements in social welfare rates of payment announced in the budget. It introduces new income support measures for carers, special rate pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance and a new widowed parent grant. It also provides for exemptions from PRSI for low paid employees, a radical reform of the method of assessing capital for social assistance purposes and improvements for farmers and people making the transition from welfare to work. The Bill addresses commitments set out in the Government's action programme, as recently reviewed, aimed at building an inclusive society and improves the living standards of everyone on social welfare.</P>
      <P>This year's package of social welfare improvements is by far the most significant ever, involving a core budget package of £403 million, increased since budget day to £428 million to include improvements aimed at pensioners, people with disabilities and the low paid. In addition, this Bill provides for substantial reductions totalling £103 million in PRSI and health contribution levies for low paid employees. This amounts to a total package of £531 million. To put this in context, the equivalent figures for my previous two budgets were £225 million in 1998 and £316 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>That is not all. I also refer to the social inclusion commitments entered into by the Government with the social partners in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which forms a solid basis for further economic prosperity and promoting greater social inclusion over the next three years. All rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payment. For pensioners the new agreement confirms that the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments given in the review of the Government's action programme. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target of a monthly child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child. These commitments are backed up by a £1.5 billion investment over the three years. This investment represents a clear demonstration of this Government's priority in ensuring that the fruits of our new found prosperity will be shared equally among all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I wish to outline the provisions contained in the Bill. Securing the future of older people continues to be a key priority of this Government. Since we took office we have taken significant steps towards our objective of building an inclusive society. In our recent review of An Action Programme for the Millennium we have set priorities in a number of key areas, including the attainment of a minimum rate of £100 to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002 and to increasing these pensions in line with increases in average industrial earnings. The Bill delivers on these commitments. It increases all pensions to older people by £7 per week bringing old age (contributory) and retirement pensions to £96 per week and on target to exceed our original commitment to a rate of £100 per week for those pensions in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment to widow(er)'s (contributory) pensioners for those aged 66 or over increases to £89.10 with the old age (non-contributory) pension increasing to £85.50 &ndash; both on line to reach £100 by 2002. These increases represent real increases for pensioners well ahead of the expected rise in average earnings. The Government is also committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. The personal rates of social welfare payments, other than those for older people and invalidity pensioners, are being increased by £4 per week. This represents an increase of about 5.5% for most payments, the same level as the wage increase agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>I secured Government approval for an additional increase of £1.90 in the standard weekly rate of invalidity pension. This will increase the weekly rate by £5.90 from £75.20 to £81.10 and bring it into line with the standard rate of widow's and widower's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for a special increase in the rate of qualified adult allowances for this year as part of an overall strategy to increase the allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This Bill represents the first step in this strategy by providing for a minimum increase of £3.80 in the general qualified adult rate. The qualified rate for old age contributory and retirement pensioners is being increased by £4.70 per week giving a total increase for a pensioner couple of £11.70 per week. The rate for old age non-contributory pensioners where the qualified adult is aged over 66 is being increased by £7.50 with such couples gaining £14.50 per week overall. There are also higher increases for those rates currently below 60% of the relevant personal rate.</P>
    <P>The combination of personal and qualified adult increases will mean that couples will receive a minimum weekly increase of £7.80 per week, an increase of almost 7%. The increases in the weekly rates will take effect from the first week of May or four weeks earlier than last year. Next year, I intend to bring forward this implemen<Col N="310" /> tation date to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the importance of child benefit in providing financial support to families and in reducing child poverty. The Bill provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates resulting in a full year investment of some £106 million which represents an overall increase of 23% in the cost of the scheme. Child benefit rates will be increased by £8 per month in respect of the first two children and by £10 per month in respect of the third child and subsequent children. This means that a family with three children will receive £141 per month, an increase of £26. I intend over the next few years to continue to provide substantial increases in child benefit in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with a priority focus towards £100 per month to the third child and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 34 introduce key reductions relating to PRSI and the health contributions aimed at improving the position of low paid workers, following on the discussions of the new partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Under section 8, employees paying Classes A, H and E contributions earning £226 or less per week will be exempt from paying PRSI. Employees earning more than this will continue to pay PRSI on earnings above the PRSI allowance of £100. More than 460,000 employees will gain up to £5.67 per week from this additional measure at a cost of £50 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The earnings limit for exempting employees from the 2% health contribution is also being increased under section 34 from £217 per week to £280 per week, £14,560 per year. All employees earning between £217 and £280 per week and all self-employed people earning between £11,250 and £14,560 will benefit by up to £5.60 per week at a cost of £52.6 million in a full year. This will benefit up to 200,000 workers.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 also provide for an increase, from April next, in the earnings ceilings up to which contributions are payable by employers, employees and the self-employed and for a reduction of 0. 7% in the employer's rate of social insurance contribution to compensate for the introduction of the new training fund levy later this year.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures aimed at improving the incentive to work and alleviating certain unemployment traps. Section 7 increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from May next by £13 which will lead to an increase of approximately £8 per week in the average FIS payment. I also intend to increase by way of regulations the minimum payment provided under the scheme from £5 per week to £10 per week.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the tapered qualified adult allowance arrangements, which relate to the treatment of spouses' earnings are being improved and extended to include people on invalidity, old age contributory and retirement <Col N="311" /> pensions. At present, a qualified adult allowance is payable where the qualified adult has income or earnings of less than £60 per week. A reduced allowance is paid where his or her income is between £60 and £105 per week and in such cases child dependant increases are payable at 50%. The improvements announced in the budget provide for an upward adjustment of the income range to £70 and £135 per week, improvements in the rate of withdrawal and the full payment of child dependant payments until the spouse's earnings exceed £135 per week. Section 20 implements the latter measure. This improvement will be of particular benefit to families where the head of the household is claiming social welfare and the other is engaged in part time work. A family with two children, where the spouse has earnings of £90 per week, for instance, will be better off by £38 from May next, by comparison with the current system.</P>
    <P>I am also taking steps in section 26 to improve the treatment of people on rent supplement who take up part-time or casual work opportunities. Under the existing arrangements, any increases in earnings are currently clawed back in full by way of reduced rent supplement payments. From April, a £25 income disregard will be introduced to ensure there is a positive return from work for those who avail of part-time work opportunities. The section also provides for a disregard of additional income arising from participation in training courses, such as FÁS skills training courses, for people in receipt of rent supplement. This measure will take effect by April next and some 2,500 people are expected to benefit.</P>
    <P>The valuable role of carers in our society is irreplaceable. No other Government has been as committed to supporting carers as this one. We have delivered on a wide range of measures, both in terms of income support and in terms of services provided. This is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of carer's allowance which have increased by more than 60%, from 9,200 when we took up office to more than 14,200 at the end of this month. Expenditure has also increased substantially and will be more than doubled this year, from £36.5 million in 1997 to £78.3 million this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to improvements in the carer's allowance, I have extended existing schemes to carers, such as the free schemes, and introduced new support measures such as the respite care grant. I am providing for an increase of £100 in the respite care grant this year.</P>
    <P>However, in spite of these major improvements, more needs to be done and this Bill extends our support to a new group of carers. As announced in the budget, I am introducing a radical and innovative benefit scheme to enable carers to give up work temporarily to care full time while still retaining their employment rights. This will ensure that our social insurance system caters for a very important contingency with which many of us are only too familiar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> I am very pleased that the Government has agreed to extend the duration of the carer's benefit and associated leave from 12 months, as originally announced, to 15 months. The new scheme, to be called &ldquo;carer's benefit&rdquo;, will involve two central elements, both of which are regarded as essential to the recipient. The first of these is a weekly income support payment of £88.50, to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be a social insurance benefit and will therefore not be means tested. It will be paid provided the relevant PRSI contribution conditions have been met.</P>
    <P>The second entitlement is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. This will require the introduction of separate legislation by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 12 outline the main features of the new scheme. The new benefit will be based on a person's PRSI contributions and the maximum claim duration will be set at 15 months in respect of any one care recipient. This time period should be sufficient to facilitate carers who have to leave the work force temporarily to care for an elderly or infirm person or to make alternative long-term arrangements. In addition, it will allow for the protection of the carer's employment rights, which is a key feature of the scheme. In the event of the carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, the carer will be able to apply for carer's allowance. Although it will not be means tested, the new scheme will be closely linked to the means tested carer's allowance in relation to other conditions. The same medical criteria, residency and part-time working conditions will apply. Employed contributors paying social insurance will be included for the purpose of the carer's benefit scheme, except for the self-employed, class S, and those earning less than £30, class J. The scheme will be available to people in employment for at least three months immediately prior to claiming benefit, who have at least three years' contributions and are working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight prior to commencing full-time caring duties. The weekly rate of payment will be £88.50 and additional increases for child dependants will be payable, where appropriate. The Bill also provides for an additional payment in cases where a carer is caring for more than one person, as applies to the carer's allowance and for payment of a respite care grant. It is estimated that when the scheme reaches maturity there could be in the region of 6,600 claimants of this benefit. This new scheme will become operational from October 2000, following the introduction of the necessary legislation by my colleague on the protection of carers' employment rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in my budget speech last year, I announced that my Department would carry out a review of the qualifying conditions for the retirement and old age contributory pensions <Col N="313" /> in 1999. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that the first phase of this review is now completed. The second phase will be finalised before the end of 2000. The review is looking closely at the operation of the current yearly average test and the implications of moving to a total contributions approach which many people consider more equitable.</P>
    <P>In relation to contributions paid prior to 1953, Deputies will be aware that such contributions, while currently taken into account for certain requirements in determining entitlement to old age contributory and retirement pensions, are not counted in determining the yearly average test. Consequently, many people with pre-1953 insurance have failed to qualify for pensions or only qualified for a minimum pension because their contributions were not fully recognised. Under section 16 of the Bill, these people may now qualify for a special old age contributory pension at 50% of the maximum personal rate if they have at least five years or 260 social insurance contributions paid under the National Health Insurance Acts or a combination of pre- and post-1953 insurance.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to announce significant improvements in the current structure of the rates bands for the retirement and old age contributory pensions. The current structure includes five different rates of reduced pensions. This will now be reduced to three rates. Pensioners with a yearly average ranging between 20 and 47 contributions will now be entitled to a reduced rate of pension equivalent to 98% of the maximum personal rate. This change will result in some 38,000 pensioners receiving overall increases of between £7.50 and £12.20 in their weekly personal rates of pension. This improvement will take effect from May next and will be implemented in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 17 introduces radical changes to the method of assessing capital for social assistance payments. This is an issue that has been raised by the Oireachtas Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, by members of my own parliamentary party and indeed by Deputies on all sides of the House. Concerns have been expressed, for example, that the effective assessment rates under the existing system, particularly in the case of single people with relatively low amounts of capital, bear little relation to the actual returns currently available on investments. I am pleased to be in a position to respond positively to these genuine concerns and I have gone further than required. I am introducing quite radical changes to the system of capital assessment and extending this improvement to most social assistance schemes, including unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the new arrangements will provide that the first £10,000 of capital will be completely disregarded. Capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, and capi<Col N="314" /> tal above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. These limits will be doubled in the case of a married couple in receipt of old age non-contributory or blind pensions or carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>This new system, which will be introduced next October, at a full year cost of £6.7 million has a number of key virtues. First and foremost, it means that pensioners with the lowest amounts of capital will not face any pension reduction. A survey of old age pensioners with capital, undertaken by my Department, found that 88% had capital of less than £10,000. The majority of pensioners with capital will no longer find that capital assessed against their pension. The change is equitable and progressive and is considerably easier to understand from the perspective of the customer. It also provides significant gains to social welfare claimants who have capital. For example, a single pensioner with £10,000 capital will gain £6 per week as a result of this change. This will also apply to those on unemployment assistance, as announced earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides for a number of improvements in the farm assist scheme agreed as part of a package for the farming community outlined in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. They involve a reduction in the assessment rate from 80% to 70% and an increase of £100 per annum in the child income disregards. Both these improvements will make a valuable contribution in supporting farmers on low incomes. It is proposed these improvements will also apply in the case of low income self-employed fishermen claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the 1999 Social Welfare Act, I introduced an enhanced bereavement grant of £500. As a result of this measure, the numbers claiming the bereavement grant in 1999 increased by 80% and expenditure on the scheme increased fourfold. I also indicated that it was my intention to introduce further measures in this year's Bill to address some of the difficulties and problems faced by newly bereaved people. We are all well aware of the particular grief experienced by families on the loss of a spouse and parent. The emotional difficulties can be particularly acute as, more often than not, it means the loss of a spouse at a relatively young age. In addition, with children involved there can also be very practical problems for a newly widowed person at this time.</P>
    <P>To assist newly widowed persons with children to cope in the immediate aftermath of such a loss, the Government has decided to introduce a special additional grant payment of £1,000 effective from budget day, 1 December 1999. This is provided for in sections 13 to 15 of the Bill. The grant will be payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for widow's and widower's contributory pension, a one parent family payment or a bereavement grant payable on the death of their spouse. It is estimated that the payment will benefit over 1,500 widows and <Col N="315" /> widowers each year at a cost of £1.5 million. The measures contained in section 25 of the Bill deal with the problem where the six weeks after death payment is not currently made or is paid at a reduced amount. This is additional to the changes announced in December's budget. These arise in particular in households where there are two pensions in payment and in cases involving the payment of one parent family payment. Approximately 3,300 people will benefit from these measures at a full year cost of approximately £1.5 million. These measures will mean that a six weeks after death payment now applies in all circumstances under the social welfare code. We have eliminated the many anomalies in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill implements one of the social inclusion commitments in the proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and addresses a concern which has been raised many times by Members of this House and other public representatives. The section allows an unemployed person to qualify for either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, whichever is more beneficial to his or her circumstances. This change will be of particular benefit to community employment workers who were previously long-term unemployed. They will now be able to claim unemployment assistance at the long-term rate if they revert to the live register and qualify for extended child dependant increases for school going children up to age 22 and for secondary benefits such as free fuel and the Christmas bonus, which is a bone of contention in this House every year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the miscellaneous provisions. Current financing arrangements of the social insurance fund allow for the reimbursement from the fund to the Exchequer of social insurance costs arising where a person entitled to old age or widow's and widower's contributory pension or deserted wife's benefit opts instead to claim old age non-contributory pension at a higher rate. The annual cost of these payments is £24 million. These provisions are being extended to other categories of payments where a person who is entitled to a social insurance benefit on foot of his or her PRSI contributions opts instead to claim certain assistance payments at a higher rate, for example, a higher unemployment assistance payment than an unemployment benefit payment. The new arrangements are expected to cost in the region of £22 million annually.</P>
    <P>Section 29 also provides for the charging to the fund of expenditure incurred in relation to recipients of social insurance payments under certain free schemes administered by my Department. These schemes are currently available to people receiving certain social welfare payments or other qualifying payments, or who are aged over 66 years and satisfy a means test. The schemes are currently fully financed by the Exchequer from my Department's Vote. This change will not lead to an increase in overall expenditure by my <Col N="316" /> Department but will involve a transfer of charges from my Department's Vote to the fund of approximately £71 million.The section further provides that expenditure incurred under the medical card system for dental treatment for insured persons who would otherwise qualify under my Department's dental benefit scheme by virtue of their PRSI contributions will also be borne by the social insurance fund. This will involve a transfer of approximately £7 million in charges from the Exchequer to the fund. I believe it is logical, therefore, to charge the social insurance related expenditure, such as free schemes, to the social insurance fund. On the same principle, it is also logical to recoup from the fund any liability which exists where a person who is entitled to a social insurance benefit on foot of his or her PRSI contributions opts instead to claim certain assistance payments at a higher rate.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for changes in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. As Deputies are aware, the scheme is currently operated by health boards under the general direction and control of the Minister. The purpose of this amendment is to enable deciding officers of my Department to decide entitlement in certain cases. These include claims for basic supplementary welfare allowance from people who are awaiting a decision on claims made for social welfare payments, such as unemployment assistance or one parent family payment, and claims for retention of rent or mortgage interest supplement from people who are making the transition from welfare to work with the support of active labour market programmes such as the back-to-work allowance.</P>
    <P>Some 22,000 people currently receive a basic weekly payment under the scheme. Just over half of these, 11,600 people, claim supplementary welfare allowance from their local health board while awaiting a decision on claims before my Department for payments such as unemployment assistance/benefit or one parent family payment. Dissatisfaction has been expressed by public representatives and others that people seeking assistance from the State are obliged to make their case in duplicate at the health board office, having already provided all the relevant details to the Department. Some 47,000 people currently receive rent or mortgage interest supplements under the scheme. Approximately 5,000 of these are people who are making the transition from welfare to work with the assistance of programmes such as the back-to-work allowance. They receive supplementary welfare allowance under special arrangements introduced as a work incentive and, in most cases, would not qualify under the standard rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. It is my intention to provide for the direct payment of supplementary welfare allowance by my Department in these cases with a view to improving customer service and administrative efficacy. This proposal is in line with the conclusions reached by the <Col N="317" /> Comptroller and Auditor General in 1998 in his report on the value for money examination of the administration of the scheme. My Department is at present consulting with the relevant staff interests in the health boards on the appropriate timescale for this change. Following these discussions, I will be bringing forward regulations giving effect to this transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 32, at the request of the Department of Health and Children, extends the scope of the legislative provisions I introduced in 1998 for an integrated social services system to include the National Breast Screening Board on the list of specified bodies. Deputies will recall that these provisions provided for the standardisation of the RSI number as a unique public service identifier, the introduction of a public service card and a payment card and the sharing and transfer of personal information between specified public bodies for the purposes of determining entitlement to certain social services and for the control of such services. The existing list of specified bodies includes Departments, local authorities, health boards, the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, An Post, the General Registry Office, the Legal Aid Board, the General Medical Services Payments Board and the voluntary hospitals. My Department has consulted with a wide range of specified bodies on how the new system should work. Plans are now well advanced to launch a combined PPSN and public service care initiative across the public service to heighten public awareness of the potential it offers for improved service delivery. This initiative will include the development of a common means database accessible to agencies delivering means tested public service schemes.</P>
    <P>At this stage I wish to inform the House of my intention to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to extend the existing data sharing provisions to allow data exchange between my Department and other specified bodies for the purpose of providing them with a PPSN for each person for whom they hold records. The amendment will provide also that my Department provides to local authorities landlord details of tenancies in respect of which a rent supplement is payable by my Department to assist them in carrying out their statutory responsibilities with regard to fire safety and accommodation standards in relation to private rented accommodation; that the Department of Education and Science track early school leavers across publicly funded training courses so that the information may be used to develop appropriate responses in terms of outreach and curriculum development; and that the National Breast Screening Board should exchange data with other specified bodies, using the PPSN, for the purposes of identifying persons who, for public health reasons, may be invited to participate in their programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of post-retirement integration, I tabled an amendment in last year's Social Welfare Act to prohibit reductions in occupational pensions already in payment arising from increases in social welfare pensions, as <Col N="318" /> recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative. However, I am still concerned that, under the rules of a very small number of occupational pension schemes, the integration process is continued after retirement under a total pension income approach effectively depriving the pensioner of the full benefit of the large increases in recent years in the social welfare pension. Therefore, I am tabling an amendment to this Bill which will prohibit this practice. In relation to the general issue of post-retirement integration, I will be considering a report which I have requested from the Pensions Board on the indexation of occupational pensions generally in the context of the new pensions Bill which I propose to publish during the summer.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to looking after the needs of our older people, carers and others who are dependent on the social welfare system for income support. This is clearly evident when one considers the additional resources being made available for these improvements &ndash; £252 million this year and £428 million in a full year. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael will vote against the Social Welfare Bill. We will do so not because of what is included in the Bill but because of what is not included. This Government has unprecedented resources at its disposal and it has failed to use this bounty in a fair way to help the poor, the disabled and the vulnerable in society. It has dispensed mere crumbs to carers and children and totally failed to address their real needs. The Government, therefore, has squandered the substantial resources and real opportunities that now exist to tackle want and poverty in society. Someone once said that poverty will always be with us. Perhaps they were right because each day someone will be poorer than someone else. Some will have designer clothes, some will not. Some will have the latest DVD video player, while others will have to make do with the ordinary video. Some may have an Ansbacher account, the rest of us will not. However, that is life &ndash; the division between the haves and those who have somewhat less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is another type of poverty, a real poverty. For all the glories of the Celtic tiger, poverty still exists. The issue for some people is not whether they can afford the latest Nike footwear, but whether they can afford the cost of putting basic shoes on their children. The issue is not whether these people can afford to eat in the Shelbourne and get themselves in the gossip columns of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> but whether they can afford to buy basic good food for their families in the local Dunnes Stores or SuperValu. These people are not worried whether they can buy a new apartment on the Quays and fill it with designer furniture or have a new car with a 2000 registration but whether they can afford the bus fare or be able to pay the rent to enable them to <Col N="319" /> provide a proper, decent home for their families. It is all too easy in this image conscious boom and bloom Ireland to forget that such real poverty still exists.</P>
    <P>In the past, when Ireland was poor, people knew about it. It could be seen on every street where children went barefoot to school, wore hand-me-downs from their older siblings and the houses had no running water. That was the world of <i>Strumpet City</i> and <i>Angela's Ashes</i>. Poverty in those days seemed like part and parcel of our Irishness. There was struggle on the land to survive the mass emigration that drove Irish people in their millions to greener pastures in Manchester, Boston or Adelaide. In those days the majority were poor, some desperately so, while only a small minority had the money to live well and avoid the daily slog that haunted the ordinary Irish. Today things are different and most are no longer at the bottom of the heap. In Celtic tiger Ireland there is more money and it is spread far more widely, thank God. We no longer see children barefoot or wearing hand-me-downs. Emigration is no longer the spectre which haunts families. Even those in relative poverty can hide it to some degree by buying new clothes in the large department stores; they can hide their relative poverty in homes furnished with cheap mass produced items that make them look as good as the homes of the rich and famous. However, this change should not fool us into thinking that poverty no longer exists.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it affects fewer people, a smaller percentage of the population, than in the past, but for many poverty is still a haunting reality. It makes every living day a nightmare and a humiliation. These thousands of people see the country racing ahead and the wealth of some and they wonder &ldquo;Why them&rdquo;? Why are they being left behind by the Celtic tiger economy? Why is their housing estate falling apart because of a lack of investment? Why are they begging on the streets because adequate hostel accommodation is not available? Why are their children left behind and forgotten? Do they not matter?</P>
    <P>Why do we continue to allow such deprivation to exist? This is the essential question that we in politics must address and that the Government has not answered. Where is the anger that should exist at the fact that, despite all the resources at our disposal, our tiger economy continues to leave so many citizens behind? Are we so blinded by the new rat race of greed that those who are gaining the benefits of the economy do not care any more about the poor? Are we condoning poverty? Do we think it does not matter now that it no longer affects us?</P>
    <P>Seán Lemass once said that a rising tide would lift all boats &ndash; if only that were true. The trouble is that many of those boats cannot float because they are leaking, damaged by a lack of educational opportunities, long-term unemployment and extreme poverty. If those damaged and leaking boats are to be made to float and be capable <Col N="320" /> of catching the full force of the economy's rising tide, they need help, resources, investment and hope.</P>
    <P>If one wants to see the reality of how little of the booming economy's benefits are seeping down to the poorest of our fellow citizens, one should look at the job supplements in the<i> Irish Independent</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Examiner</i>. One will see the highly paid jobs that are available, but many of them require third level qualifications.</P>
    <P>One should then go to Trinity College, Dublin, UCD or any other third level institution to see how many working class children one can spot. One will not see many, but one will see plenty of middle class children and those whose families already had the means. They were in undamaged boats, so to speak, that could catch the rising tide and get all the opportunities that it brought. That is fine. It is great that our graduates are doing so well, but it does not help to spread the new wealth around the nation. Those at the bottom of the pile do not end up in educational institutions which will make them employable and eligible for the large salaries and the opportunities now available.</P>
    <P>The only working class people one will see in Trinity College, Dublin, UCD, UCG, UCC or any other third level college are the contract cleaners scrubbing the floors at night when the middle class students and lecturers have gone home. What plans does the Government have to tackle this problem? What plans are in place to open the door of opportunity, particularly educational opportunity, to those who are at present marginalised? This aspect is not dealt with in the Bill. It is only one example of the many to which one can refer.</P>
    <P>A British king once said famously, &ldquo;Something must be done&rdquo; and I echo that phrase. Perhaps from the 1920s to the early 1990s one could have made convincing excuses, proclaimed the State's poverty and said how much one wished one could do something about it. We did not have the resources and Ireland was a poor country. For example, in 1966, Ireland was in receipt of a developing country loan from the World Bank. There was poverty and our economy was not performing well enough to give us the means to do something about it.</P>
    <P>However, those excuses are not acceptable any more and this is the major plea I wish to make in relation to the Bill. There is so much money in the Exchequer that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, could wallpaper his office with £100 notes and carpet Government Buildings with £50 notes without even noticing. We like to think we are moral people and it is the case. Whatever about the State and the Government, the people have shown their generosity towards the poor in the Third World. I saw that when I was a Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid. As a people, we showed that we are hugely generous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> Now is our chance to put that morality into action as far as our own people are concerned. We have the means, resources and potential. All we need is the will not only to say something must be done, but to do it and to show that when we use the phrase &ldquo;independent Ireland&rdquo;, we mean an Ireland independent of poverty. We should make Pearse's words in the Easter Proclamation about cherishing the children of the nation equally a living, breathing hope filled reality of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the Social Welfare Bill must be considered. It is probably the main instrument of Government focus this year on the needs of the less well off in our society. However, does it pass the test of being an effective instrument? It is fair to say that the moneys being made available are greater than in previous years. I accept that is the case. It is also fair to say that the bruising budget battle has brought some additional benefits with an improved social welfare deal for some pensioners and some on low pay. However, in the wider context of the Government having the historic opportunity with ample funds to declare war on poverty, the Social Welfare Bill will have only a marginal impact.</P>
    <P>Even worse, it must be considered against the widening gulf created by the budget which laid the foundations for a two tier society. Effectively, in the budget, the Government gave the well off ten times the gain of the less well off. Is that fair? It is the classic way to imbed a two tier society. Even worse, the crumbs provided for the very poor will copperfasten their poverty.</P>
    <P>CORI gave its verdict and I agree with it. It said &ldquo;This is a scandalous squandering of resources and is indefensible in the context of the poverty and social exclusion that is still so prevalent around the country.&rdquo;  CORI does an excellent job examining Government policies and measures. It has a slant which favours the less well off in society. I am happy with that, but, at the same time, it gives an objective analysis of the measures introduced by Governments. I have rarely seen such criticism from CORI as in relation to the measures introduced by the Government in the overall package of the budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>CORI knows, as we know and the Government must know, that with the unprecedented resources available to the Government there was a real and historic opportunity to establish a war on want and poverty. That opportunity has been squandered. CORI said the approach adopted by the Government is unfair because those who are already better off gain much more than those who are poor. They remain poor because the Government has not taken steps to lift them out of poverty. Benefits are skewed towards the better off and they have been given substantial gains. The poor are once again left collecting crumbs from the table The Government has to take note of this legitimate criticism. If one does not take into account the flowery phrases about child poverty <Col N="322" /> and problems of ill-health and disability, one must take note of the figures. An analysis of the way the Government allocated funding from its new resources for 2000 indicates that under the Social Welfare Bill &ndash; the main instrument for coping with wanton poverty in society &ndash; social welfare increases funded by taxation get only a 8.9% increase. Is that adequate? Is the Minister proud of that? The Minister proclaims all the good he has done, and some good has been done, but is he proud that he has been limited by the Government and the Minister for Finance&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;a movement, such as the credit unions, with 1.5 million members can afford to say he does not give a damn about the poor because that is the message coming from the Government. This is not a Social Welfare Bill of which the Government can be proud but it is not even a Social Welfare Bill of which this nation can be proud. I do not wish to dwell on each item in detail, nor would time permit it, but there are a couple of areas on which I wish to focus.</P>
      <P>Carers and children have always been two of my main concerns. Both sectors have been treated disgracefully in the Bill. The Minister repeats the usual mantra about how much the Government cares for the carers and what a great job it is doing. He introduced a limited scheme for carer's benefit. He confirms that the valuable role of carers in our society is irreplaceable. If so, why does he not do something about the majority of carers who get no support from the State? It is all very well to go into detail about the carer's benefit. It will mean a minor improvement for a number of people who have to give up employment to take on the role of carer. What about the tens of thousands of carers who are already caring for their aged and disabled relatives and who get absolutely no support from the State? We do not know the number of carers. The Government admits there are approximately 50,000. It also admits that only slightly more than a quarter of that number receive support. The carers associations mention much bigger numbers. I do not know the total number, but there are tens of thousands of carers looking after people in need of full-time care and attention, the majority of whom are getting no support from the State. They are precluded from such support because of two main rules &ndash; the means test and receipt of social welfare. This Government, with the billions of pounds at its disposal, should focus attention on those two iniquities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> I would like the means test to be abolished &ndash; that may be an issue for the distant future. As of now it should be relaxed. When was the means test for couples last relaxed? As I understand it, this Government has never altered it for couples and it has not been relaxed since the £250 disregard was established about five years ago. Why does the Government, which claims the valuable role of carers in our society is irreplaceable, continue to ignore those who, because of the means test, are precluded from getting an allowance?</P>
    <P>Another major objection is that those on social welfare are precluded from the carer's allowance. How can any Government justify that? Normally those on social welfare, particularly those on assistance payments, are at the bottom of the pile, the lower rung of society. They, like everybody else &ndash; in some cases even more so &ndash; care for elderly relatives and disabled members of their families. Why should they be excluded from a carer's allowance? The Minister may respond with a technicality and say they can get the carer's allowance. They have to give up their other income to get it. Effectively, they are precluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance. That is unjust and the Minister has no real answer to my criticism on that front.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the great work being done by the Government for children. Everybody knows we have a bad record so far as our children are concerned. State support for our children is the worst in Europe, apart from Spain and Portugal. What are we doing with the wealth at our disposal? Children will get nothing extra today, tomorrow, next week or next month. The Minister reminds us of the great job he is doing because from next October about £2 per week will be payable for children.</P>
    <P>Everybody, including the Minister, accepts that one of the best means by which child poverty can be tackled effectively is through child benefit. It channels resources directly to families and is of particular importance to families on low income. The Minister said the incidence of child poverty is a major concern of this Government. He claims the Government is seeking to ensure our children are protected and given the opportunities to bridge an inter-generational cycle of poverty. How then does he justify the main anti-poverty instrument of this Government for the new millennium which gives nothing extra to children for two-thirds of the year and only a miserable £2 per week for the last third. The expression &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; aptly sums up this miserable allocation.</P>
    <P>What galls me is the smug self-satisfaction of the Government. I see it in the way the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, dismisses the credit unions. His approach is one of total arrogance. As a member of a credit union I am affronted by that approach. The few pounds I have in the credit union will not be affected by it, but there are 16,000 volunteers who are committed to that movement and that is the attitude of the Minister. <Col N="324" /> I have tried to provide support for the Minister, Deputy Ahern, in getting extra resources from the Cabinet but the smug self-satisfaction of the Government galls me. Some of its members seem to believe the increase of a few pounds per week in welfare payments will enable people to confront the pressures of poverty on their lives. I cannot believe the Minister, who is an intelligent man, believes that, perhaps he is putting on a front. That smug self-satisfaction is a symbol of this Government so far as the weak, the poor and the vulnerable in society are concerned. This approach is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make no impact of consequence on the problems of the disadvantaged in society. The resources are available to make such an impact but clearly the political will is not there to commit those resources to a war on wanton poverty.</P>
    <P>In the past few years some changes have been made to the means test. I have fought battles about the means test over many years. I am glad to see some changes are being made in the means test but I am not entirely happy with the Minister's approach. The basis on which the new means test is made is confusing. I am glad the first £10,000 of savings will be disregarded but the test is not fair at higher levels. I have always assumed the means test should be calculated on the basis of actual returns. The system outlined by the Minister calculates interest on £1,000 at £4 weekly. This amounts to £200 per year, or 20%. Is this fair? Any revised system should be a fair system. Is the Minister making a bad system worse? If it is the Minister's intention to set a cut-off point beyond which holders of money on deposit will not receive a social welfare payment, he should say so openly. He should not maintain the charade of providing a fair system while basing it on the assumption that bank deposits earn interest at 20%. This is something of which the Minister cannot be proud.</P>
    <P>The Minister has placed the rural post office network at risk. At the moment a contract does not exist for the delivery of welfare payments. This is because of a complaint to the European Union about the renewal of the An Post contract. The weakness of the Minister's defence on this issue is that the complainant is using the very arguments the Minister himself used when he was insisting that the contract should be put out to tender. This is obvious from the notes of his meeting with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in September 1998, which have been released under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>Only following a political storm in the lead-up to the local elections did the Minister do a U-turn and agree to open negotiations directly with An Post for the renewal of the contract. Unfortunately for him and the country, he is now trying to compete in Brussels against his own arguments for open tender. I favour the renewal of the contract with An Post. I do not see how any other system can provide the nationwide distribution necessary for the effective delivery of social welfare payments. As matters stand, the system and the national network of rural post offices are at risk and the Minister carries the full responsibility for this situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government had an opportunity to do something for the poor, the weak and the vulnerable. They have not taken that opportunity. Next year, I hope a different Government will ensure that a reasonable and proper allocation is made to deal with the problems I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is historic for all the wrong reasons. Never before have the provisions in a social welfare Bill differed so vastly from those announced on budget day. The purpose of this Bill is to save the face of the Minister for Finance. It is not motivated by a desire for social justice or the redistribution of wealth but by a desire to keep the Government intact, regardless of the consequences. The Bill is born out of the unprecedented tick-tacking which followed budget day. Few Members of the House could comprehend the blatant give-away the Government awarded to those who are already doing very well in our booming economy. Even Fianna Fáil backbenchers could not believe what they were hearing when Deputy McCreevy delivered his biggest ever give-away budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So stark was the contrast between the awards given to the well-off and the low paid that social partnership almost collapsed. The outrage expressed by the third pillar of the national agreement and the withdrawal of SIPTU from the talks forced the Government to rethink the most <Col N="326" /> socially divisive budget in the country's history. Hence, the faithful lieutenant and namesake of the Taoiseach has been sent out to rescue the Government when it is in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>The failure of the budget to address the question of the tax burden of the low paid was its biggest crime. There is no logic to awarding a tax cut of £1,620 to a single earner on £50,000 while a single earner on £10,000 receives an annual increase of only £206. Basic logic dictates that a person on the lowest income deserves the biggest gain. However, the warped logic of the Government gave the most to those who deserve it least, so that they can buy another expensive car, take another expensive holiday and enjoy the fruits of our Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    <P>So headstrong was the Minister for Finance that he refused to deal with the issue of low pay in the Finance Bill. In fact, his headstrong attitude is characteristic of this Government. Instead, the Minister for Finance has passed the buck to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and we are presented with a Bill which proposes to raid the social insurance fund in the name of social justice. The social insurance fund must carry the can for the mistakes of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. Until recently, PRSI was regarded as a second tax. The social insurance fund operated at such a loss throughout most of its history that it was unable to cover basic outgoings such as unemployment payments. All this has changed and our social insurance fund has developed into a fine little war chest, with surpluses of £600 million predicted in the next couple of years. We are in a position to attach a real sense of integrity and usefulness to the area of social insurance. We have a chance to offer better income support to those out of work and enhanced benefits to those in work.</P>
    <P>Such are the proposals which the Minister should have presented in this Bill. He should have presented a comprehensive programme based on an expanding social insurance fund. He has had almost three years to formulate a new approach to the funding of benefits for the least wealthy but he has clearly failed in the administration of his brief. Given the policy direction of the Government, the chance to develop the social insurance fund is now withering away. The new threshold for PRSI will be a short-term income boost for the very low paid but an expansion of the system of tax credits would have been more beneficial. Why did the Minister not explore the concept of positive tax credits in this year's budget or at least aim for it in next year's? </P>
    <P>The majority of workers should contribute to social insurance and it should offer very real and expanded benefits. The Bill proposes a social welfare exemption for workers earning less than £226 per week. It also proposes a relatively small increase in the PRSI ceiling, bringing it to £26,500. The new exemption and the continuation of the ceiling significantly reduces the number of people eligible to contribute to the social insurance fund, <Col N="327" /> thereby stealing the integrity which it has established in recent times. When the Bill landed on our desks section 29 was the one that jumped out at us. It is the key change and far more significant than the famous section included in the 1999 Act dealing with the stopping of motor vehicles. It provides for the charging to the social insurance fund of expenditure incurred under certain free schemes &ndash; free fuel allowance, free electricity allowance, free television licence, free telephone rental allowance, free natural gas allowance, free bottled gas allowance and dental treatment under certain conditions &ndash; and where a person opts for a higher unemployment assistance payment. While I accept that this has to be agreed between the Minister and the Minister for Finance, we still have not been informed why this is being done at a cost in the order of £70 million. It seems that it has been estimated that within a few years there will be a fund surplus of £600 million. With this image dangling in front of their eyes the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance decided to make a raid.</P>
    <P>Like many other Members I am deeply concerned at the influence exerted by the Progressive Democrats and, in particular, the powerful Progressive Democrats wing of Fianna Fáil, including as it does the Minister for Finance within its deadly embrace. When on this side of the House the Tánaiste and the Attorney General said time and again that, if at all possible, the concept of social insurance should be abolished as it was simply another tax on business. That central core of the Government does not give a damn about social insurance and for blatant ideological reasons wants to get rid of it. This contrasts with the progress made in relation to capital taxation. It is clear that it is operating to a narrow ideological agenda.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party totally opposes this sleight of hand to transfer the charges involved to the social insurance fund. Given the projected budget surplus there is no justification for it. While it will have the technical effect of reducing direct Government expenditure, the Appropriations-in-Aid will have to be adjusted downwards to take account of it. Even on accountancy terms, therefore, it seems that this is a very dodgy section to which the Labour Party will table a major amendment.</P>
    <P>If we are to believe the mainly aspirational Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, our trade union colleagues have secured agreement on the establishment of an overseeing board. Such a board is badly needed given that the Government has now put its hand in the fund and clearly cannot be trusted. The fund surplus could have been utilised to fund the integration of tax and social welfare contribution rates, the elimination of poverty traps or, alternatively, measures such as a family responsibility payment, among others, which were the subject of a recent fine discussion document on the nexus between social welfare and taxation. A reduction in the standard <Col N="328" /> employee PRSI contribution could also have been considered. If the fund is to be operated properly and progressively it needs to be developed extensively. The Labour Party will shortly bring forward proposals on how this can be done.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that it is the intention to reform the fund. I note the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to establish a social insurance fund board which I hope will be established shortly and that we will have a report and plan of action without delay. The Labour Party will not sit idly by and watch the fund fall apart under this careless Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration.</P>
    <P>The Bill which contains so-called rebalancing measures creates a new poverty trap for those on low incomes. Those who are 1p over the exemption limit of £226 will continue to pay PRSI in the normal way, thereby creating another complex anomaly. There is consensus that the creation of such anomalies should be avoided. In trying to eliminate anomalies the Minister, as many commentators, including the economist, Mr. Colm Rapple, have said, has created two or three others. This is beyond belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I have asked the Minister to look again at the situation on pre-1953 contributions, I welcome section 16 in Part V of the Bill which has been criticised in the media and which attempts to provide some cover for those who paid contributions under the National Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1952, or have a combination of such contributions and qualifying contributions. I have raised this issue almost every time the Minister has answered questions in the House since my appointment as my party's spokesperson on social welfare. I, therefore, welcome the initiative taken by him. Anomalies remain, however, in the contribution system. It has been highlighted recently that persons who paid contributions for up to nine years still are not receiving benefits because of the manner in which they compiled the contributions. I may return to this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Apart from the botched job on section 29, there are a host of other issues which I wish to address. The new carer's benefit is very welcome and is an example of how the social insurance fund surplus can be used to positive effect. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and I called time and again at Question Time for the introduction of such a benefit. Lest the Minister has had his head buried in the sand for the past 12 months, there is widespread consensus that the gradual abolition of the means test for carer's allowance is the most appropriate way of acknowledging the contribution of carers to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new carer's benefit is designed to assist workers who leave their jobs temporarily to care <Col N="329" /> for a relative and will only be payable for 15 months. Existing carers will not benefit. The new benefit will be useful where a relative has a terminal illness and only has a short time to live. This ignores the sacrifices made by others when forced to give up their jobs permanently to care for a relative with a long-term illness or disability.</P>
    <P>All parties in the House have met the Carers Association since the Bill was published last week.</P>
    <P>I was struck by some of the contributions of carers about the difficult lives they have led, caring for a person for perhaps 30, 40 or 50 years with little support at times because the head of the household works. It is something to which the Minister might have returned between the budget and the publication of the Bill. Indeed, I think the Minister announced at Question Time to Deputy O'Keeffe and me that he had extended the 12 month period for the carer's benefit to 15 months. Perhaps he could look at it again to see whether it could be further extended and come back to us. For example, as carers said to us last week in Leinster House, on the basis of medical reports there might be an extension of from nine months to a year and a half.</P>
    <P>At current levels, of course, the cost of funding all full-time carers &ndash; I presume they were talking in terms of funding up to 50,000 full-time carers &ndash; would be £150 million per year. The Minister's officials gave me that information at the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, of which I am vice-chairman. Many of us calculated the cost of caring for that number of people in institutions. However one looks at it, it could cost perhaps ten times that amount to adequately care for all of those who are being cared for voluntarily in a heroic way by carers all around the country.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that the Government should remove the means test for the full-time carers allowance and should move speedily towards a situation where full-time carers are given a basic payment. The extension of the carer's allowance to all carers would be an acknowledgement of their tremendous work and the savings they make to the State through the provision of home based as opposed to institutional care.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals we received from the Carers' Association and others which the Minister might consider on Committee Stage, there is also a proposal to provide that spouses may swap the carer's benefit where one carer is working within the family home to allow the benefit to transfer from one person to the other in a family. The fundamental point about caring is that, as the Minister said, the State has reached 14,200, but this seems to be still only a quarter of the people who are caring on a full-time basis. I ask him again to look at ways in which the benefits for carers could be extended.</P>
    <P>On the issue of social welfare payments, which takes up the major part of the Bill, there has been a great deal of praise in Government circles of the increase in old age pensions. However, in the <Col N="330" /> context of the much flaunted £100 target for OAPs, the £7 increase is disappointing. The Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, which I met a few months ago, was confidently expecting that the Minister would break the £100 barrier this year, not next year. It must be remembered that people on non-contributory pensions have a long way to go to break the £100 barrier.</P>
    <P>Much worse, of course, was the £4 basic increase for long-term social welfare claimants. Those increases must be seen in the context of Government surpluses of £16 billion projected to 2002 and the general increase in social welfare is well below the £6.50 needed to raise social welfare levels to 50% of median household income.</P>
    <P>There has been a lengthy discussion in the media about current inflation rates. In his speech on the budget the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs took pride in the fact that he has awarded increases of between 5.2% to 5.6%, but in the context of a 4.6% inflation rate where does that leave the most vulnerable people in society? Is it not the case that he is barely keeping ahead of inflation as the Celtic tiger finds it hard to struggle with the poor performance of the euro <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling in particular? There is significant imported inflation and also inflation through the property market and elsewhere. This morning I heard an economist, Mr. Jim O'Leary of Davy Stockbrokers, state on the radio that in 2000 there would be an inflation rate of 7% in services and entertainment. People on social welfare certainly use services and need entertainment also. How do the Minister's increases of between 5.2% to 5.6% compare in the context of the performance of the economy? This only emphasises the fact that this year's £4 increase was shameful and the Minister should have been thinking in terms of at least £6.50 to meet the demands from Share the Wealth and many other groups to approach the 50% of median income target.</P>
    <P>The rates which take effect from May next, that is, unemployment assistance of £77.50, blind person's benefit of £77.50, invalidity benefit of £79.20 and the widow's pension of £81.10, are modest incomes by any stretch of the imagination for people who are totally dependent on them. It is shameful in the era in which we live, where there are 8% to 10% sustained growth rates, that the social welfare general increases should be so low. I asked the Minister on a number of occasions at Question Time for a basic increase of £10 per week and I remember discussing this in committee with Deputy Noel Ahern, chairman of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, but the Minister chose not to spend some of the additional funding on the most vulnerable citizens and to stick with a modest increase. The gains the Minister may have made with the senior citizens are now seriously under threat due to the overheating economy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing forward the date of the payment of these increases to May 2000 and that he is on target in the context of Budget 2001 to bring them forward to April in <Col N="331" /> 2001, but it must be remembered that there is still a large range of critical payments which are stretched towards the end of 2000 &ndash; for example, the new carer's benefit. If I understood him correctly incidentally, the Minister stated that it will not be introduced until the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, introduces the necessary legislation on the workplace. Nevertheless, he is still targeting its introduction for October. Child benefit, as always, will not be increased until September. Why did he not consider bringing that forward? The free schemes for the carers will be introduced in October 2000 also. In addition, the new capital assessment operates only from October 2000.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the general £132 package for 2000 is ludicrously modest in the context of the immense strides which the economy has made. It seems that the strategy of awarding the lowest increases in social welfare payments to unemployment assistance and disability allowance is a determination on the Government's behalf to create an undeserving poor. While I accept that the healthy state of the jobs market has taken many welfare dependants off the dole, there are people with serious labour market difficulties who will not get a job no matter how good the employment climate.</P>
    <P>For adult dependants, the introduction of the 77% dependant rates has been put on the long finger. The Minister is now operating over a three year term when we urged him to do it this year. Adult dependants, mainly women, are being awarded a disgraceful increase of £3.80 per week. This is indicative of the Government's confused budget. While it is still planning to equalise the social welfare payments for married dependants, it is effectively removing the same principle from the tax code. I would again urge the Minister to look again at individualisation of social welfare, which is what the Labour Party asked him to do, instead of which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, came in with a proposal on taxation which nobody anticipated. I welcome the extension of the benefits for senior citizens and the extension of the free schemes although, as I said, the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament and other bodies were expecting far greater progress on some of the terms.</P>
    <P>Regarding widows and widowers, I welcome the new widowed parent grant of £1,000, but the Minister still has not moved on the arrears and that is something to which we will return on Committee Stage. The Minister still has not moved on the problem of disability benefit. Although it was a small incremental benefit, we are, after 20 years, in the last few days of the operation of the butter voucher scheme. As far as I can see, the Minister has no provision to make up for the small amount of money which has been lost by some of the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
    <P>The total failure of the budget to address in a meaningful way the child care crisis is most disappointing. It is disappointing that the Social Wel<Col N="332" /> fare Bill and the new national agreement have failed to establish any framework for a parental payment to directly assist families with the cost of child care. To this end, I do not accept that even in the lifetime of the new national programme the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs could not bring its computer programme capacity up to date to deal with the administration of a parental child care payment. A child care payment along the lines put forward by the Child Care 2000 campaign would significantly improve access to child care, particularly for families on low incomes. I again urge the Minister to study the proposals put forward before the budget by my colleague Deputy Shortall which were a very comprehensive approach to child care provision referring to a child care task force, the designation of a Minister for Children and, in particular, a parental payment.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of this Bill because of the small amount of assistance given to those most in need despite our booming economy. It has not come forward with a vision of how poverty might be eliminated. The Labour Party and my party leader, Deputy Quinn, have made fundamental proposals on how the position of so many of our fellow citizens living in poverty could be addressed. There is nothing in this Bill which does that.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, we will focus on section 29 and the blatant attempt to raid the social insurance fund to cover up the fundamental mistakes made by the Minister for Finance in the budget and to try to use this fund, to its detriment, to keep the social partners quiet while the right-wing ideological drift of the Department of Finance and the Government is allowed to continue. One of the figures which stuck in my mind was that which the Minister for Finance cut off capital taxation, particularly given the total package the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has introduced in this Social Welfare Bill. The figure is nearly the same and that is comment enough on the Government.</P>
    <P>When the time comes, the Labour Party will bring forward its own proposals on the development, expansion and security of the social insurance fund. It will develop it in such a way that it will become a major support for our people, particularly the least able and the most deprived. We will be happy to bring forward such proposals to the House and the people on that occasion.</P>

      <P>&mdash;being able to tease out matters and to listen to the good news from Ministers' reports on their briefs.</P>
      <P>Social welfare is a huge expenditure item &ndash; close to £5.5 billion this year. The measures the Minister has brought forward will amount to £428 million from the budget figures plus over £100 million extra given the reductions in the PRSI and health levies. That is another £550 million, which is a considerable sum. I congratulate the Minister on holding on to so much of that money despite the savings and the reduction in the numbers drawing unemployment assistance. He has done well to hold on to much of that money which will be spent on innovative improvements in other spheres under his control.</P>
      <P>I am proud to be a member of Fianna Fáil. Over the past seven or eight years all politicians agreed that the elderly, as a category, were being left behind. The emphasis seemed to be on the long-term unemployed. A couple of years ago it was decided at political level that the elderly needed to be brought up to a certain level. When times are good we should at least reward those who struggled through the difficult times.</P>
      <P>There is fantastic progress with the £7 increase in the old age pension this year &ndash; bringing the total increase to £18 over the past three years &ndash; the considerable increase in the number of elderly people over 70 years who qualify for the medical card, although I know it does not come under the remit of this Department, and the large increase in the exemption limits for tax. I am proud to be part of a Government which has done so much for the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Deputy said and what other groups are saying. There is almost a resentment among community groups who believe other categories have not kept up with the elderly. There are commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that other groups will be brought up to that level. That is fine but the benefits we have got for the elderly must be retained. The increase given to the old age pensioners, who have done their bit over the years, over other categories must be retained, although I welcome the commitments in the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that £7 increase, others aspects of the budget have not got publicity. The dependent adult gets an increase of £4.70, the dependent adult on an invalidity pension gets £8 or £8.50 and the dependent adult on the non-contributory pension also gets an increase. There are increases for several people way above what they got in other years. Normally, they get a<i> pro rata</i> sum based on the increase but there has been movement this year. I welcome the Minister's decision on the pre-1953 issue. The Department's line was that when one paid the stamp, back in 1951, it did not include any element of old age pension contribution. That was a technical point and it may <Col N="335" /> have been correct, but the people did not understand why that was the case. Then a rule was introduced whereby contributors were given credit for some of their contribution years. I am delighted there has been movement on that measure. When a move was made last year to provide for the self-employed who were relatively new to the system, I thought it was a shame that the people who had paid stamps were not entitled to this benefit. Therefore, I welcome the introduction of this measure in the budget. It will help many people who were self-employed at some stage in their lives who may have been in and out of work and not have paid their full stamps, people who worked in State or semi-State bodies and many women who worked for five to ten years and married in 1955 or 1965 whose husbands worked in CIE, the Civil Service or the ESB and did not have a social welfare pension. Many people will qualify for the payment of £48 old age pension for the first time. Many of them will be women and they will view this payment which they will get in their own right as a sign that they have been recognised for the first time, given that in the past they did not receive any pension payment because their husbands had an occupational pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced changes in the averaging, which will mean that many people will get increases up to £12.20 depending on their position. These changes are welcome. When beneficiaries get these increases on 1 May they will recognise there was a great deal of good news behind the bare statistics.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the free schemes. Having worked for many years in a semi-State body, I was aware that many of my colleagues were not entitled to free schemes. If one was in receipt of an occupational pension under the superannuation fund 20 years ago, one thought one was far better off than the worker in receipt of a social welfare pension, but circumstances have changed greatly over the past 15 years with increases in social welfare benefit and additional free schemes. The person in receipt of benefit under the supperannuation fund has been left behind and, therefore, I am delighted that these extra benefits will be given to workers.</P>
    <P>Some speakers spoke a load of nonsense about the poor and poverty. I do not want to be critical of any speaker, but some speakers talk about the poor and poverty and they know nothing about it except what they have read in a book. The solution to poverty is not about giving money to the poor. While money helps provide the basic necessities, eradicating poverty is about more than handing out increases of £4, £6.50 or £8.50; it is about giving people something to do, giving them a reason to get up in the morning and giving them dignity. We must provide for that and the Social Welfare Bill is part of that, but we must not pretend it is outlining a vision of all aspects of Government business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> The claim that the Celtic tiger is evident in only certain parts of Dublin and has not extended elsewhere is nonsense. I do not like mentioning parts of my constituency or stigmatising areas, but the Celtic tiger is evident outside parts of Dublin. The Celtic tiger has arrived in Ballymun, an area that had many problems and many disadvantaged people. All one need do is note the lack of car parking spaces. Public representatives hear constituents complain that there is nowhere to park their cars. We did not hear about that problem five years or 15 years ago. It is a new problem and, in a sense, a welcome one. Motorists there are not driving 00 D &ldquo;Jags&rdquo; but they have cars. The benefits of the Celtic tiger are trickling down, however slowly.</P>

      <P>The way to eradicate poverty is to give people the opportunity to earn money. Everyone who is fit and healthy ought to work. We must realise that many people are long-term unemployed &ndash; in some cases unemployment has been in the family for two generations &ndash; and it is difficult for them to adapt to this new culture and to realise that things have changed. However, many of them with the help of various courses and educational supports are returning to the workforce and encouraging their families to participate in education.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Broughan who has left the Chamber and represents a nearby constituency would agree that we must not only change the attitude of people who have been long-term unemployment but we must also change the attitude of employers. A recent survey carried out by one of the partnership companies, possibly the Northside Partnership, reveals that young people from disadvantaged areas on the northside who have achieved leaving certificate results and, in some cases, third level results comparable to those achieved by young people from areas, such as Glasnevin and Foxrock, are not doing as well. As well as changing the attitude and culture of the people who are long-term unemployment, we must also change the attitude and the culture of employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this issue during the debate on the employment equality Bill introduced by the previous Government. That Bill dealt with discrimination on grounds of gender, religion, nationality, colour, race and creed and all those socialist buzz terms. When I suggested that the scope of the Bill should be extended to include geographic discrimination, which is the main form of discrimination that exists in this city &ndash; the other forms of discrimination are buzz words that were solved years ago &ndash; that did not fit in with the socialist thinking and it was brushed aside. I do not know how we can solve this form of discrimination. I do not know whether there should be a quota of jobs in State companies for people from certain suburbs as there are for disabled people. When <Col N="337" /> people from disadvantaged areas work hard and do their best to send their children to school, it is important that those young people get decent jobs and are perceived in their areas as good role models. If such young people say they worked hard to qualify for a Bite scholarship or whatever and got their degree but are still working as waitresses or in some similar position, that would inflict terrible damage and it is disheartening for the young people concerned. I do not know how we can change the attitude of employers who stigmatise certain suburbs. That is a major problem. We are trying to move away from the position where young people give their granny's address in order to have a chance of getting an interview.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on increasing the numbers on the back to work scheme and on the other educational supports that will be introduced. I am aware this is not directly the responsibility of the Deputy but I am unhappy about the way the CE schemes are being operated. The Department of Enterprise and Employment commissioned a consultant and probably paid him a fortune and he recommended that we reduce the number of CE schemes. That is a crazy move. It misses the point totally. This is our chance. Things are going well. If we do not solve the problems of unemployment and poverty now, we never will. It is nonsense for a consultant to recommend that there should be only 28,000 on CE schemes when there are 200,000 unemployed, on the basis that there were 40,000 on CE schemes when 300,000 were unemployed and then submit a bill for £100,000 and 100 pages of gunk. That is nonsense, and I am appalled that it got through the Cabinet. If there are 100,000 long-term unemployed, there should be 100,000 people on community employment schemes. Such schemes give people something to do, a reason to get up in the morning, a few extra pounds. However, CE schemes have been taken over by lone parents and a few other groups. It is a shame to see a family man or woman who is prepared to work and wants to show his children that he is getting up in the morning and only getting £18 for his 20 hours' work being taken off community employment scheme. It is shameful that people aged 58 or 59 being taken off these schemes and told they have done their three years, that nothing more can be done for them and that they should go home. Some of those people are great people. They are prepared to work for 20 hours a week for £18. Let us give them work. They will not get a high-tech IT job, but we should let them work, let them have their £18 &ndash; it should be increased to £25 or £40 a week. It is not just the cost of it. These people still have children who receive a signal or message from the fact that their parents have a reason to get up and go out in the morning. I am very disappointed with the cutting back of CE schemes. However, CE schemes are being abused. Lone parents are taking them over. It is up to us to stop abuses. Some of the changes implemented last year were genuine and worthwhile, but we generally lost the <Col N="338" /> plot and that is wrong because in many disadvantaged areas community work is done under CE schemes, some of which are marvellous. They may not be a great training for a job in an IT factory, but they are good for community life and they give people something to do.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the main social welfare payments are to be made from May. That was a hugely controversial issue for years. I am delighted the Minister has moved forward and is committed to bringing such payments forward to 6 April. We toyed with the issue for a few years, various Ministers bringing it forward by a week or so. This is a big jump but it is typical of political life that once it is achieved it is no longer mentioned. It is a case of saying the problem is solved, lead us on to the next. However, this is a good move and I am glad that by 6 April next year that problem will be out of the way.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the increases in child benefit. The way to increase child benefit is by doing it gradually every year, not to by going overboard in one year, which can be misconstrued by some people. I note the emphasis in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on increasing the payment for the third and subsequent children. That is nonsense and should be got rid of. It is a wonder there is not an even higher rate for the tenth and fifteenth child just to show how marvellous we are for having reached our target. However, we should think of the message that is sending out &ndash; keep working away to get the high rate. It is like the lotto, and there is no logic to it any more. The main extra costs for a family are probably incurred with the first child, not the third, fourth or fifth. The Joint Committee on Social Community and Family Affairs asked Ministers to provide the higher rate. If the Minister wants to blame somebody, he can blame the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear what various people have to say about social welfare Bills, much of which is determined by which side of the House they sit on. If the preamble to a person's speech contained information about whether that person was in Opposition or in Government it would probably be possible to predict what they will say.</P>
      <P>A number of interesting ideas have emerged. First, I am not sure whether Deputy Noel Ahern has improved his promotional prospects by being so critical of the Minister. Maybe he has a more direct route to the call to favour. Nevertheless he has made a few very worthwhile criticisms of the present day regime which are interesting to note. I will deal with those in a moment.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the Social Welfare Bill in the context of the overall budget. It is strange that a Government that had £1.6 billion to give away managed somehow to make a mess of it. How could a Minister with so much money to play around with make a mess of it? That is something that will be contemplated in Government circles for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> Deputy Noel Ahern was very critical of anybody who criticised this Bill, particularly anybody who said he would vote against it. He highlighted that if Fine Gael vote against it, it would vote against the £7 increase. When Deputy Ahern voted against a Social Welfare Bill three years ago, was he voting against the huge increase in child benefit? Perhaps he will respond at a later stage. It is possible to point to any one part of a Bill and say that is what someone is voting against. The Deputy understands that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure there was a vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>There was. Fianna Fáil voted against the Bill in its entirety, and it would be possible to pick out any one aspect of it, say that was what Fianna Fáil voted against, and put the interpretation Deputy Ahern is putting on it. If he makes such comments he should look to see whether his own house is in order before taking the matter forward.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Ahern in relation to community employment schemes. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern is now in the House, and I know, having worked in committee with him, that he has a particular grá for such schemes. What Deputy Noel Ahern said is apt. We should look again at the community employment schemes. There is one point I would add to what Deputy Ahern said. There are many people working on community employment schemes. It is good that they get out and go to work and so on. However, they also fulfil a tremendous social function, doing work in the community that is very important from a social point of view. Some of them are caretakers in schools, community centres, GAA centres and the like. Some of them work with disabled people. Given that they do a tremendous job for the community, I find it difficult to justify telling somebody who is 55, 56 or 57 years of age that he has to stop doing that very good work for 12 months until he comes back into benefit before he can go back on the scheme again. I ask the Minister to intervene with the Tánaiste on that and try to improve the situation so that those people can continue to do the very good work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point relates to the timing of increases. We welcome the fact that many increases will now be paid in May. Nevertheless many will not kick in until the back end of the year. Child benefit always seems to be stuck around September of the year it is introduced. Why does it take so long for those benefits to kick in? Surely it creates and maintains a two-tier society when benefits for those on social welfare do not kick in until May or September or even October or November, while benefits for people on PAYE kick in on 6 April every year. Is that not maintaining the two-tier society that we have? Surely the benefits should accrue to every<Col N="340" /> body at the same time. It is a basic understanding of any system that people should be treated equally and I hope we can move fairly quickly to that position.</P>
    <P>The actual increase in child benefit this year was moderate to say the least. There was a huge expectation that the increases would be much larger than they were, and there was much disappointment when they were announced. When he is summing up, perhaps the Minister will comment on why the increase was so small. There was a potential for a greater increase in child benefit and the Minister is well aware that for approximately 60% of people child benefit is the only income they have in their own name. That is a huge number &ndash; mainly women &ndash; who are in receipt of child benefit and it is a tremendous boost to them. It should have been increased further.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I intend over the next few years to continue to provide substantial increases in child benefit in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with a priority focus towards £100 per week to the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>I wonder if that is a typographical error. I did not hear the Minister say it, so perhaps he altered it at the time. Has it been changed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It should read &ldquo;per month&rdquo;. I changed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>All right. I thought there was a difficulty there. I was wondering when the Minister was going to implement the £100 per week figure. Deputy Noel Ahern was dead right when he referred to the third and subsequent children. Families are now much smaller than they used to be and it is time to remove that designation of &ldquo;the third and subsequent children&rdquo;. The same rate should be payable and we should be unifying rates of payment across the board. Why should the third child be the one who receives it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no different from what the Deputy's party did when it was in Government. It was done on the basis that families with larger numbers of children are more prone to poverty. I would remind the Deputy that in 1997 only £1 was given for the first two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <P>The &ldquo;third and subsequent children&rdquo; idea has to be abolished. In my day the children's allowance was a half-crown, but the last child &ndash; and I was the last child &ndash; did not receive anything. In my time as a youngster it actually changed. I remember my mother going to claim the benefit that accrued. If one had only one child one did not get anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now time to move on and remove that anomaly. The social welfare code has many anomalies in it. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is adamant that individualisation is the way to go but when one transfers that across to the social welfare code, individualisation does not exist. For example, an adult dependant can be paid a rate of £47 if they are on unemployment benefit; it could be £64 if they are pensioners, or £53 if the male recipient is an invalid. If they are on short-term unemployment benefit it is £47. If they are on the old age non-contributory pension the adult dependant is worth £52. There is a disparity of rates applicable to the adult dependant, depending on the actual recipient of the social welfare payment. If the argument in relation to individualisation is to stand up, then surely they must be unified and brought up to an improved rate.</P>
      <P>We have the same difficulty with the child dependant allowance. The child of an unemployed person is worth £13 a week, but the child of a lone parent is worth £15 a week and that of a prisoner is worth £17 per week. Why are three different rates applicable to child dependants? Surely the Minister should take the bull by the horns and have one rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point relating to the Social Welfare Bill, although it is not directly contained in it, is the £600 million that is being put into the long-term pension fund. The Bill that was brought forward to create this fund did not stipulate how the money would be spent. It is simply put into a nest egg and left there to hatch. Hopefully it will hatch and taxpayers' money will not be wasted. I hope it will be invested wisely. I contend that much of the thinking on pension funds may not be accurately based. That is because it is very difficult to make projections for 2050 and subsequent years. If the projections are based on early 1980s figures, one must take into account the fact that tens of thousands of people were leaving the country annually and population figures were quite high. In 1983, for example, there were approximately 80,000 15 year olds. If the predictions were based on that year &ndash; rather than 1993 when the number of seven to eight year olds had fallen dramatically <Col N="342" /> to approximately 50,000, and there was net immigration &ndash; then the projections at the end of that 50 year period would be totally different.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that projections can be done over a 20 or 25 year period, but to project further than that is taking a shot in the dark. It is difficult to know where the population figure is going. If we place too much emphasis on what will happen that far down the road, we may leave those currently dependent on social welfare without money that could be invested in such schemes now.</P>
    <P>Carers have not been looked after well in the Bill. There was an expectation that they would get something worthwhile, but their income disregard has not been reviewed for a long time. As the Deputies present are well aware, thousands of people are doing an excellent job, 24 hours day, caring for dependants. They feel let down and left out because they have received no recognition for the job they are doing. It is disappointing that the Minister did not see fit to improve the carers' lot. This is an increasingly contentious point which will have to be rectified quickly. One comes across so many cases of hardship involving people who do a great job, yet they are being kicked in the teeth. The classic case is that of the woman who was looking after her father-in-law while her husband was working. She was in receipt of a carer's allowance because he was on a relatively low income. When her husband died, however, she qualified for a contributory widow's pension and thus lost the carer's allowance. That woman had lost her husband and the carer's allowance, yet she still had to look after her father-in-law. The system was unfair to her. I know the rules say that one cannot have two incomes from the same source, but in cases like this the rules should be changed and the Minister should examine this situation.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment to widows is very disappointing. Widows have a particularly difficult situation to deal with. They are left without a breadwinner and the money they receive is a pittance. Last night I spoke to a widower whose wife has recently died. He is 81 and said he had seen a newspaper report about a bereavement grant of £1,000 to widowed people. He said he was delighted to see it, as he was not well off and wondered if he would qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>When we checked the small print of the Social Welfare Bill we found he did not qualify because he does not have any dependent children. He said it was typical of politicians to take the kudos for a big announcement while the small print excluded as many people as possible. It is disappointing that that announcement was made in the way it was as we now find the number of people who can avail of it will be quite limited. The same applies to some people with contributions made before 1953. I made representations on that issue and wrote to one man who had contacted me about it to tell him the good news, but this will only come into play in October. He wondered <Col N="343" /> whether the Minister hoped he would be dead by October so he would not be able to draw that benefit. Many people will benefit from this and it is a pity it cannot be brought in sooner.</P>
    <P>The issue of farmers on the farm retirement scheme is outside the Minister's remit, but I ask him to raise the matter at Cabinet. It is important to note that this Government is telling retired farmers they cannot have an increase in their pensions. If they get on the farm retirement scheme and quality for the old age pension, as the social welfare pension increases their farm retirement pension decreases so that they remain at a constant level. Last year they were docked 5% because of the rate of conversion to the euro. It is a disgrace that the farming community should be held at this level without any prospect of an increase &ndash; all they got was a decrease. Given collective Cabinet responsibility, how can the Minister justify that? I ask him to intervene with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to have that put right. It is unfair that the farming community should have incomes capped in that way when the same restrictions do not apply to others. Someone on a social welfare pension gets an increase of £7, but a farmer on the farm retirement scheme will receive that increase only to have it taken away by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That is unfair and should be put right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a comprehensive Bill and I compliment the Minister on dealing with long standing anomalies, some of which were referred to by Deputy McGrath. I have also made many efforts to have issues such as contributions made before 1953 dealt with and was totally ignored. The Minister is to be complimented, though I am disappointed with the sting in the tail in that it will not come in for some months. However, it is most welcome and I imagine it was strenuously resisted by officials, probably those in the Department of Finance, who would have argued that it was not a pension contribution. However, the Minister has taken the issue on. He saw the difficulty faced by people who had what would have been termed good jobs in the past but who do not have pensions. Anomalies will always come up, but I will deal with specific issues later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the Bill's measures will be welcomed by everyone. Though the Opposition opposes the Bill it cannot criticise the whole Bill and will welcome portions of it at least. Any fair-minded contribution would have to compliment the Minister &ndash; as Deputy McGrath and others have &ndash; on what he has included in the Bill. I am sure the Minister sees the comments made by speakers as encouragement to continue his efforts, though we have also heard criticism. That is the job of the Opposition, but it should be constructive criticism. What is difficult to entertain, as Deputy Noel Ahern said, is the criticism of bringing forward payments of old age and other pensions. <Col N="344" /> That is hard to take from Members who were here in 1997. The final submission in the 1997 budget from those now criticising this budget was to push payments out to November, though I am open to correction on that. I do not know if Deputy McGrath was party to that, but he was part of the coalition at a time when social welfare increases were to be implemented in November and obviously he did not vote against that proposal. This Minister is bringing payments into effect in May and this is the second occasion he has brought payments forward by a month. It is correct that changes for PAYE workers and others take place in April, but Opposition Members made no effort to implement that. In fact, it is on record that the Minister in 1997 proposed to pay the increases in November. That is recorded in the Official Report, but it is also clearly recorded in the minds of members of the public affected by it and who put that Government out of office. An earlier speaker mentioned the difference between the good talk and the good act being very clear. This Minister has been very active, which I welcome. It is logical to treat all people equally and to pay them all at the same time.</P>
    <P>Other criticisms are being levelled by people who were party to decisions on social welfare increases at that time, but the alibi for not acting is now gone. I recently heard a Fine Gael spokesperson claiming the country was awash with money when this Government took office. The alibi for not taking a more humane approach is now gone. I have learnt that when distributing public money, the question of prioritising needs and causes arises. There is a danger that funding is given to more vocal or better organised groups and over the years many legitimate and worthy causes have been left behind or not attended to because of that. I welcome the Minister's approach in ensuring individual voices are listened to and account is taken of them. One does not need to be in an organised group to have one's case heard.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the Government's approach to the co-ordination of issues on an interdepartmental basis. There was difficulty with this in the past. Now the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance work to co-ordinate their approach on issues for which there is interdepartmental responsibility, striving to remove anomalies that exist and that would have continued to arise as the range and level of services improved if a new approach was not adopted. Too often in the past the public suffered because cases fell into a grey area of departmental inactivity. The first reaction of a Department and some Ministers seemed to be can this be passed to another Department? Happily that approach has changed and for that we must thank the Taoiseach and Ministers for responding to his directive on cross-Department co-operation.</P>
    <P>Nobody works in isolation and that is true of Departments. If the Taoiseach did not insist on <Col N="345" /> that new approach we would continue to have sad cases. For example, the education of those with special needs fell between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. That affected a category of people but there are many other issues that apply to the individual. In the past, their rights were compromised as a result of the lack of a co-ordinated approach by Departments.</P>
    <P>This is a crucial aspect of the Taoiseach's approach and one he has articulated on a number of occasions. It forms part of the social inclusion programme we are implementing. We now have multi-annual budgeting and so on and it is important that Departments are not allowed to work in isolation.</P>
    <P>Another cause of concern to all public representatives is that when schemes are introduced, particularly those that are more innovative, some people will not benefit from them and will feel badly done by. In many instances it is obvious that there is an unintentional effect and genuine grounds for grievance. In such cases there should be a willingness to investigate the matter and, where possible, sufficient inbuilt flexibility to deal with the seemingly unfair issue. We have all battled over the years to rectify such problems. I am glad that many of the issues were dealt with by Fianna Fáil Ministers, for example, <i>pro rata</i> pensions and mixed pensions. I am also glad that when we are canvassing and issues are raised, there is not a feeling of helplessness and the attitude that things cannot be changed. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, is to be complimented.</P>
    <P>In the past, regardless of the merits of the case raised, the bureaucratic response was it did not fall within the terms laid down. I am glad that over the past three years we have taken a different approach and have been willing to deal with anomalies. Social welfare is a very complicated field and every time a change is made it will have a ripple effect. We must be prepared and able to deal with that. Very often, it is the personality of the Minister that will decide the approach taken and in this instance I am very happy with the approach.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to social inclusion and the policies included in the Programme for Government will ensure all citizens, whether in organised groups, are catered for and their situation improved. That commitment is reflected throughout the Social Welfare Bill and in other legislation. We are committed to the areas of social inclusion and environmental impact. Through my involvement with the Southern Health Board and community activities, the care of the elderly and the handicapped have been to the forefront of the issues I have been involved in over the years. They are two broad headings and cover a variety of specific but related requirements, such as the carer's allowance and facilities for carers. Deputy McGrath mentioned the disappointment at how badly carers had fared. I put on record that no Government has done more for carers than this one. I <Col N="346" /> hope that will continue as there are still great needs to be met</P>
    <P>Many arguments will be put forward on a number of issues, such as abolishing the means test. Would it be unfair to give badly needed money to someone who is extremely wealthy but who would meet all the other requirements or should it be given only to those who are less well off? We must continue to improve the well being of carers. However, there are many related issues such as respite care, finance and so on. There was a failure to deal with this issue in the past and I welcome our approach to it. I will continue with my efforts to ensure there are improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>All these issues can involve a number of Departments. Sheltered housing, voluntary housing aid for the elderly, essential housing repairs, and so on involve the Department of the Environment and the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs are also affected. From almost his first day in office the Taoiseach set up an interdepartmental co-operation group and has ensured the public are catered for.</P>
    <P>There are many improvements under the Bill. Elderly people like to keep money in the bank for their funeral but they ran into difficulty when they applied for various services. The Minister has taken this on board and I am glad the threshold has been raised to £10,000. It was a matter that affected a vast number of people and caused them great concern. Such thinking should be extended to other schemes. Ten thousand pounds is a modest sum but it represents a significant change. With the rapid increase in house prices, the market value of property, which may be of no immediate benefit to anyone, is causing difficulty for people claiming benefit. The Minister is attending to that area and I am glad of that.</P>
    <P>Moves towards introducing a basic pension of £100 a week are continuing and the £7 increase in this budget is a major step towards achieving that objective. There has been criticism from some quarters. I can understand a new Opposition Deputy saying the £100 pension should be granted this year. However, it is hard to take criticism from someone who has held ministerial office, but, like thunder, this must be listened to.</P>
    <P>These payments will come into effect in May, which has not been widely publicised, apart from some press releases by the Department. This was forgotten in the furore surrounding the budget and the efforts by some, including Deputy McGrath who spoke earlier, to mask the improvements. I do not know the cost of introducing these payments although I am sure it is substantial. I welcome them and I hope the £100 pension will be achieved next April. I have yet to hear the Opposition compliment the Minister, perhaps because of embarrassment as before it left Government it proposed that social welfare increases be implemented in November. I would like the Opposition to give credit to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> Child benefit is central in assisting families provide for the needs of their children. Credit is due to the Minister for the generous and timely 25% increase in child benefit. I welcome his commitment to improve it further. Deputy Noel Ahern dealt with child benefit. We work with poor families and we know how important child benefit is to them. I would like to see the Minister continue this approach. I also welcome the increase in the family income supplement thresholds which will have a great impact. This increase is targeted at the less well off.</P>
    <P>I am expected to speak well of the Bill. However, I am glad the criticisms I made last year and the previous one have been acted upon. I compliment the Minister on his work to date and I wish him well. The continuation of these policies in the next number of years will change the social structure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the £500 bereavement grant and the<i> pro rata </i>contributory pension arrangements for those who were over 56 years when PRSI was introduced for the self-employed. It is important to acknowledge these significant changes. I wish to highlight some of the anomalies in the social welfare system which I have come across in my constituency work. These deserve to be looked at in the context of spending an extra £400 million on social welfare.</P>
      <P>People over 66 years are entitled to many fringe benefits, including the living alone allowance. Those living alone who are under 66 years are just as deserving. The age-based criteria for the living alone allowance, free electricity and telephone rental has no basis in reality. The Minister should look at reforming this. There is an unarguable case as regards need and hardship.</P>
      <P>The poorest people I meet are dependent on supplementary welfare allowance. It is my experience, and I am sure that of other Deputies, that the approach of community welfare officers varies in this regard. Some are extremely sympathetic, understanding and helpful while others tend to be, whether they mean it, more abrupt, indifferent and even callous. A code of conduct should be introduced for community welfare officers so those in desperate circumstances who call to a local health clinic, needing a rent subsidy or other payments, can expect a minimum standard of procedure in the way they are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important schemes in dealing with poverty is not to the fore in the budget but is essential to those affected, that is, special housing aids for the elderly. This applies to old age pensioners with medical cards who require essential repairs to their houses &ndash; in many cases they may not have a toilet, bathroom or shower unit. <Col N="348" /> This is an effective but under-resourced scheme. In my county there is a waiting list of more than 200 and people can wait two or three years for a service, the need for which has been established by the health board. I have constituents whose roofs are leaking and whose windows need to be replaced. They live in a vested county council house and are not entitled to have their repairs carried out. This should be seen as a priority and a minimum standard of accommodation should be provided for the elderly.</P>
    <P>As regards the disability benefit scheme, a code of conduct is necessary for medical referees. Constituents constantly come to me saying that their disability benefit has been cut off after a visit to a medical referee. Typically, these people have back injuries and are in agony. They have a cursory discussion with a medical referee who may test their blood pressure. They do not receive a detailed examination which they could expect from a hospital or a general practitioner. Their benefit is cut off and then they go through months of appeals.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the minimum wage on 1 April, the threshold for the adult dependant's allowance needs to be reviewed. The Minister emphasised the graduation of payments over £60. However, the basic £60 payment needs to be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been increased to £70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a step forward. The pay of home helps employed by health boards will be increased from £5 per hour. This is important work. However, they will have to give up their jobs if their husbands lose the adult dependant's allowance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in the back to work schemes as regards the transfer from welfare to work. However, yesterday there was a story on the front page of the <i>Evening Herald</i> about a man who was advised by the Eastern Health Board that he must give up work if his daughter, who requires critical cardiac surgery because she has a hole in her heart, is to receive that treatment on a medical card. There needs to be more liaison between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children in providing an incentive to prevent people returning to welfare from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third level allowance needs to be reviewed. In many cases, future employability is linked to further education, such as PLC courses. The grants have been modified by the Department of Education and Science. However, many people are not eligible because of the technicalities involved regarding the vocational education committees, the higher education grant section of Wexford County Council and the Department of Education and Science. A new clause should be inserted in the qualifying criteria for the third level allowance whereby a lone parent would be able to continue his or her studies and ensure <Col N="349" /> good future prospects. The TLA should have a discretionary clause inserted which would enable these people to continue their studies if recommended by a social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>Many people returning from the UK with a full insurance record must work in Ireland before they can trigger their UK entitlements under the DHSS. There needs to be an EU approach to this issue so that Irish people travelling abroad and Europeans coming to this country can automatically receive the same social welfare entitlements, based on Irish rates, which they would receive if they still lived in the member state in which the contributions were paid. At present one must have one week's PRSI contributions to trigger one's entitlements in another member state.</P>
    <P>A real failure of the partnership agreement and the budget is in dealing with the issue of child care. Fine Gael has continually tried to emphasise that children who are too young to be in formal education, that is, under five years of age, have special needs. In many cases both parents must work to pay a mortgage. Child benefit of £25 per week for children under five is a special case. This would be a uniform payment which would be fair to people across the board and it should be implemented. Given the cost of education per child, it would provide a balance in terms of State support for children throughout their childhood.</P>
    <P>The transport sector is changing. I would like the free travel pass benefits made available to licensed operators, whether CIE or private operators, who carry pensioners or other transport users with free travel passes.</P>
    <P>I hope in due course we will move towards a basic income. It is the correct way to deal with the poverty issue. I tried in my brief contribution to highlight a number of anomalies and problems I have come across in my constituency work. I ask the Minister of State and the Department to take on board these proposals, which would not be too costly. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is the most efficient and customer-friendly in terms of representations from TDs and other public representatives. As someone who puts down many parliamentary questions, sometimes withdraws them and who has availed of the hotline service, I have nothing but the height of praise for the Department. People in rural areas in particular depend on their public representatives because there is a considerable mindset barrier to ringing a Dublin number. These people like their public representatives to articulate their cause. When Minister for Agriculture and Food, I tried to get that Department to work under the system operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It would be a good idea generally if people in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs moved out to other client-based Departments because it has consistently set the pace by improving services to customers in terms of speed, efficiency and its response to public representatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I ask the Minister of State to take on board my points. They have been made in a constructive spirit and I hope to get a response as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Second Stage debates, as in the case of the Social Welfare Bill, are very important. With their practical experience of dealing with their constituents, Deputies put forward fair, practical and realistic proposals during Second Stage debates. This enhances the effectiveness of Bills such as the Social Welfare Bill. Criticisms will be made to try to highlight to the Minister concerned the anomalies in the Bill which may affect those in receipt of social welfare benefits. It is regrettable that the proposals made by Members in a sincere manner are just recorded. Each year they continue to be recorded but not acted upon.</P>
      <P>When introduced a Bill should not be written in stone. Cognisance should be taken of the anomalies highlighted on Second Stage and they should be acted upon. The proposals are put forward by Deputies who have met with the anomalies at the coalface. The best way to measure the effectiveness of a proposal from any Department is how it operates in practice. I urge the Minister to begin the debate on the first Social Welfare Bill of the century by listening to the proposals and anomalies highlighted on Second Stage. I guarantee this will result in a much more effective Social Welfare Bill. The practical proposals highlighted should not just be recorded in the Official Report, they should be acted on because in the long-term they will benefit all the participants of the different schemes.</P>
      <P>There has never been a better time in the history of the State to be Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. There have never been more resources available or more opportunities or scope to make a real difference to the quality of life for the most vulnerable in society. Given the abundance of Exchequer funds, now is the time when we can at last narrow the margin between the haves and the have nots. We can now ease the burden on carers, people with disabilities, on the quality of care for the sick and on those who are homeless and unable to provide for themselves. Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to believe that this great opportunity was not utilised to the optimum in order to change forever the lives of those who depend on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to give them the quality of life they cannot provide for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Members, I welcome many of the aspects and improvements in the Bill. However, I deplore the unfair burden which remains on those who care for the sick, the elderly and the disabled. The real needs of the poor have not been addressed. I will concentrate on people with disabilities. It is incredible that the Government has refused to give disabled people a legally backed right to health and social services because it would cost too much, given the unprecedented <Col N="351" /> resources at its disposal. This was a key recommendation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which the Government backed.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot accept these recommendations which imply the underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as of right. That is the sentiment of the Department of Finance in a new report which states that this right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the additional cost of providing a service. Taking into consideration the recent report from the Department of Finance, is the Government committed to the needs of people with disabilities?</P>
    <P>The Government has also rejected a cost of disability payment, which was not just one of the recommendations in the commission's report but it was also one of the promises in the Fianna Fáil policy document prior to the previous election. This was called Meeting the Challenge of Equality. The many groups who campaigned for so long for these improvements are absolutely dismayed at the Government's response. Is it any wonder then that over the past year hundreds of people with physical disabilities wheeled their way to the Dáil to demand that they be treated with dignity? It is the start of a new century, but people with disabilities still live in Victorian conditions. The requests and demands of people with disabilities belong to the last century but, unfortunately, they are still relevant today.</P>
    <P>Their plea is for resource centres, personal assistance services, residential and respite care and a cost of disability payment. The cost of fulfilling these demands and the promises of Fianna Fáil while in Opposition would be £32 million. This is not a massive sum when one considers the millions the Government had to allocate to its choice areas or pet projects. The IWA is asking for public money to be redistributed to where it is needed. Yet again, unfortunately, its plea has fallen on deaf ears and the provisions of the Bill will not change the lives of people with disabilities. I always hoped that the budget at the turn of the century would have been in their favour. The Bill could, and should have been, their passport to a better future.</P>
    <P>We cannot highlight enough the abundance of resources available to the Government for its pet projects. How can a Government allocate millions to sport and leisure pursuits when so many children with physical and mental handicap cannot get respite care? In addition, little or no full-time residential care is available. Is the Government aware of the stress and strain parents are shouldering and the trauma experienced by all family members who are struggling to provide full-time care to a member of their family with a disability? Imagine their reaction and dismay <Col N="352" /> when they learned of the millions the Government was able to provide for other projects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the money provided for leisure and sports facilities, but I am not ashamed to say that I cannot accept it as long as handicapped children and severely ill people cannot get the health services they require. It says much about the Government's priorities that millions can be invested in leisure facilities while parents are desperate for respite care and a few days rest from the trauma and burden they shoulder. Many parents fear what will happen to their handicapped children in the future and they also worry about whether they will get proper care before they die.</P>
    <P>The Bill was a wonderful opportunity to show where the Government's priorities lay. Unfortunately, that opportunity was wasted. The Government could have made the needs of people with disabilities and carers a priority. Many people are carers but they do not apply for the carer's allowance. I got a leaflet today about the home carer's allowance. Whoever produced it should be told that a carer would have to take a day off to read and digest it. Do the people dealing with the carer's allowance know that carers are so tired and exhausted from carrying out their duties that they do not have the energy to apply for the carer's allowance, get all the documentation ready and fill in all the questionnaires that are required?</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case where a person had to give up work to care for a sick child. The family decided not to apply for the carer's allowance and to struggle on because of the demands it would place on them both mentally and physically. If the Government's concern for carers is genuine, it should relax the means test and make the experience of applying for the carer's allowance less stressful. It should be consumer friendly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Bill which must be viewed as a continuum of measures in the area of social policy introduced by the Government. Other Deputies mentioned the commitments made in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and more recently in agreements concluded with the social partners. The Bill introduces new income support measures for carers and special rate pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance. I will return to that matter later and I applaud the Minister for moving on it. The Bill also provides for a reduction in PRSI for low paid employees. These measures will help build a more inclusive society and improve the living standards of people on low incomes and social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social partnership needs to be taken into consideration in discussions on the Social Welfare Bill and any other financial or social measure introduced at this time. Approximately two weeks ago the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government concluded its negotiations on the new social partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This programme sets out an ambitious agenda and out<Col N="353" /> lines a comprehensive series of integrated economic and social objectives that map out the path through which we can achieve further economic prosperity and fulfil our social policy goals. The programme complements the national development plan, which sets out the planned investment of £40 billion to improve the living standards of all sectors of society, and the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, which provides the political basis for our action in Government over the rest of our term.</P>
    <P>A matter of some concern must be a statement issued recently by the Labour Party spokesperson on Finance, Deputy McDowell, in which he cynically threatened to undermine the social partnership agreement and deny people the benefits of that agreement which the Government concluded with the social partners. The Labour Party stated that it &ldquo;would not be bound&rdquo; by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These ill-judged remarks, if carried out, would threaten an agreement reached after the painstaking negotiations with employers, trade unions, farmers and the community and voluntary sectors which started on my birthday, 9 November. I heard Senator O'Toole, the vice-president of ICTU, talking this morning about how much time and commitment all the partners put into the agreement.</P>
    <P>If the agreement was allowed to unravel, the Labour Party would shatter the process of social partnership which was created by Fianna Fáil in 1987 to ensure recovery from the economic ruin created by a Fine Gael/Labour Party Government over five years. I am glad Deputy Durkan is present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is lunchtime. Social partnership, while initially opposed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party, is widely acknowledged as the key driver of our recent economic success. To threaten it now, when it has become more important than ever, is an act of national sabotage for the sake of grabbing a quick headline and manoeuvrings within the trade union movement. It is also worrying that the Labour Party appears to be in opposition to the leadership of ICTU and SIPTU who have signed up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and recognise the benefits it will bring. It is also worrying to hear suggestions from the Labour Party that it would not feel in any way obliged to implement the new programme if it found itself in Government. However, it can say that because it has little possibility of finding itself in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It must appear strange to the social partners. The Labour Party's attitude is in stark contrast to the position adopted by the Government on assuming office. It faithfully and <Col N="354" /> fully implemented the terms of Partnership 2000 even though it did not negotiate it. Fianna Fáil, unlike some other parties, regardless of whether it is in Government or Opposition, recognises the value of social partnership and of continuing in the strategic direction of policy in the interests of stability and confidence.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's efforts to undermine the latest national agreement are contrary to the national interest and fail to take account of the strength of commitment to social partnership in Ireland. Over the past 12 years, the people have seen the substantial benefits of that social partnership and there can be little doubt that a crucial ingredient of today's economic success has been the social consensus which began with the first comprehensive national agreement. To underline clearly what the Labour Party is prepared to risk for cheap publicity and short-term political gain, it is worth recalling the state of the nation prior to 1987 when the first partnership agreement, the Programame for National Recovery, was put in place.</P>
      <P>This was after the infamous 1982-87 Administration in which Deputies John Bruton and Quinn were both Ministers with senior economic portfolios. They allowed us reach a situation where inflation was as high as 21%, current borrowing was 8% of GNP with £1 being borrowed for every £6 earned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is highlighted in regard to take-home pay. Wages increased by 21% a year in the ten years to 1988, but real take-home pay fell by 14% between 1980 and 1987. In contrast, since 1988, wages have risen by 4.5% per year, <Col N="355" /> but real take-home pay has increased by 35%. The dramatic improvement in our economic and social fortunes in the period since 1987 is most evident in the spheres of employment and unemployment. Today there are 0.5 million more people at work than in 1987. The unemployment rate has dropped from 17% to less than 5%. The total number in employment today is almost 1.6 million &ndash; the highest level ever in our history.</P>
      <P>In the period since the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government took office, the number of people who are unemployed has fallen by 75,000, the unemployment rate has been halved and the level of long-term unemployment has fallen so spectacularly that we can look forward to the effective elimination of long-term unemployment in the lifetime of this Administration. That is the context of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is responding to the challenges of a changing Ireland. We are working hard to ensure our new found prosperity as a nation is spread equitably. We must now seize the opportunity before us to sustain our recent economic success and transform the quality of life of our people. The key principles underpinning the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are: to underpin Ireland's competitiveness and develop our economic prosperity on a sustainable basis and to use that increased prosperity to enhance our quality of life in the context of a fairer and more inclusive society.</P>
      <P>As a Government, we must tackle effectively the consequences of economic success, developing our infrastructure and public transport, bringing about real balance between the regions and between urban and rural communities and developing real global strengths in research and development and the information society. We must also aim to end the exclusion of blackspot neighbourhoods, tackling school drop-out and literacy problems, and giving a second chance to those who missed out on the economic boom. These blackspots are not confined to inner cities but are spread throughout rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Government is facing up to these challenges and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has the necessary focus and content to ensure everyone can benefit from social partnership, including the marginalised and disadvantaged in society. The new programme sets out detailed but flexible operational frameworks by which these over-arching objectives will be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of social inclusion, there is provision for a substantial increase in resources, amounting to £1.5 billion by 2003. This programme goes well beyond resource considerations. Within the social inclusion area, a key component in the programme centres on the issue of income adequacy. Substantial progress will be made over the lifetime of the programme towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare. In addition, the level of old age <Col N="356" /> pensions will be improved in line with the commitments in the review of the Government's own programme.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing there are important targets and significant objectives. Public transport and health care are areas for targeting. In respect of the low paid, the Government's record is second to none. More than 50,000 people including 10,000 over 65 years of age were removed from the tax net in the recent budget because their wages were so low. In just three budgets, a total of 135,000 people have been removed from the tax net by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The rainbow coalition's record of just over 30,000 in the lifetime of its Government does not stand up in comparison. The issue of low paid employees is also dealt with comprehensively in the new agreement. Under the programme the biggest gainers will be those earning less than £200 per week, who will not have to pay PRSI. This will ensure that nearly 0.5 million low-paid employees will gain up to 3.67% per week from April.</P>
    <P>The Government is also introducing in April the long-awaited national minimum wage. The programme supports increases to £4.70 from 1 July, 2001 and to £5, which will be the highest rate in Europe, from 1 October 2002. Those earning the minimum wage should be removed from the tax net within the lifetime of this Government. The measures in the Social Welfare Bill will contribute towards that objective.</P>
    <P>Minimum social welfare rates will be raised towards £100 per week during the 33 months of the agreement. In addition, the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments in the review of the Government's own programme. The recent budget provides for a £7 increase in the personal rate of pensions for those over 66 and for those over 65 on retirement and invalidity pension. This follows on the unprecedented £5 increase in his first budget and a further £6 increase in his second budget. People with selective political memories should not be allowed to forget it was not so long ago &ndash; 1995 &ndash; that Deputy De Rossa, as Minister for Social Welfare, gave pensioners a meagre £1.80. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at £96 per week, a 20% increase on the rate payable when the Government came into office, compared to a total increase of under 10% over the lifetime of the rainbow coalition. I recall that Deputy Durkan was a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in that Government.</P>

      <P>When the increase in the qualified adult payment is included, a contributory old age pensioner couple both over the age of 66 will receive £160.60 per week from next May compared to £133.40 in 1997. The Government has worked hard to ensure that work is worthwhile. It has delivered significant increases in take-home pay by reducing substantially the burden of tax on all those who work for a living.</P>
      <P>A matter close to my heart is pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance. From the beginning I felt this was an area of injustice we ought to address. Last year the Minister announced his Department would carry out a review to examine this matter. I note from his contribution today that the second phase of that review will be concluded towards the end of this year. The new pension arrangements for those who did not benefit from pre-1953 contributions will benefit approximately 3,000 people who are not receiving pensions. These are elderly people who often worked in difficult conditions. It is time they were rewarded and I applaud the Minister for introducing this measure. Approximately 38,000 pensioners will benefit from the rationalisation of the rate bands. However, I have one quibble. If we have managed to increase the reduced pensions to 98%, why can we not increase them by the remaining 2%. I hope the Minister will examine this possibility, if not this year in the next budget.</P>

      <P>I welcome the increase in the respite care grant and the introduction of carer's benefit. Nobody can pay adequate tribute to carers. We should not devise forms for carers which are difficult to complete. Deputies from all parties met representatives of the Carers' Association in the last week or so and heard some valid points. We must adopt a more customer friendly approach to form filling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £10,000 disregard of capital is important. This has been a source of worry for many people who are being assessed for welfare payments. The bereavement grant was increased last year and <Col N="358" /> the extra six weeks payment after the death of a spouse provided for in this year's Bill is extremely welcome. The extension of free schemes to those over 75 is a very progressive measure which many elderly people in my constituency will welcome. The significant increase in medical card guidelines for those over 70 will also be welcomed. A large number of people in receipt of private occupational pensions will now be eligible for medical cards. The measures regarding supplementary welfare allowances also represent a significant move forward. An applicant for supplementary welfare allowance should not be obliged to make his or her case in duplicate to the health board and to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the following anomaly. Dublin Corporation, and I assume other local authorities, encourage the sale of houses back to the local authority to add to the public housing stock. We seek a contribution from senior citizens &ndash; usually a quarter or one third &ndash; out of the proceeds of the house sale towards senior citizen accommodation. Elderly people in the Dublin area can be left with £80,000 or £90,000 when this contribution is made and there is some concern among them that this will affect their entitlements to free schemes, medical cards and so on. The Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government should examine this matter and devise measures to make it easier for elderly people to buy into this scheme without losing benefits.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill and I welcome its broad thrust. It is of particular relevance to people on low incomes, people with disabilities, old age pensioners, widows, widowers, parents of young children and all social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The increases being paid to old age pensioners are welcome. However, the new rates of £96 for the contributory old age pension and £85.50 for the non-contributory pension are insufficient, especially in view of last year's Exchequer surplus of £1,600 million. In the past we had huge budget deficits but in a time of plenty we should be much more generous to our senior citizens. The old age contributory pension should be at least £100 and there should have been a far greater increase in the non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the contributory and non-contributory pensions for widows and widowers. The pension paid to a widow under the age of 66 will increase by only £4, to £81.10. The widow's non-contributory pension will increase by only £4, to £77.50. This £4 increase to widows and widowers is too little. It is wrong and unfair. The loss of a husband or wife is a traumatic experience. Life becomes much more difficult for a widow or widower, especially when there are dependent children. Widows and <Col N="359" /> widowers must cope with the loss of a partner, which causes a major social upheaval for the family. We must be much more generous in looking after widows. I call on the Minister to look, in a caring way, at the widow's pension. There is no reason it should not be on a par with the old age pension. A widow or widower under the age of 66 is not entitled to free travel, free electricity, free television licence or free telephone rental allowance. The Minister should ensure these are granted immediately. This would be of considerable benefit to widows and widowers and would not impose an enormous burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>An enhanced bereavement grant of £500 was introduced last year. As a result of this measure there has been a huge increase in the numbers claiming the grant. The Minister said however that the new special grant of £1,000 that the Government has decided to introduce will be payable only to widows and widowers with dependent children. This grant should be payable to all widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>The subvention payable to private nursing homes should be closely examined. The maximum subvention payable is £120 but in many instances smaller amounts are being paid as one has to satisfy a means test which extends to one's relatives&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too severe and needs to be looked at. As the State has failed to provide adequate accommodate elderly persons have no choice but to enter private nursing homes, the cost of care in which continues to increase while their assets are depleting. While the overall standard has improved, it now costs between £250 and £350 per week to maintain an elderly person in a private nursing home. The elderly should be entitled to live out their lives in dignity and comfort. It is therefore incumbent on the Minister to ensure the subvention payable is substantially increased.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Mid-West Private Nursing Homes Association, Mr. Vincent Kinsella, stated recently that the lack of funding for private nursing homes is a human rights issue and that the elderly are entitled to end their days with dignity and pride. I fully share his views. This issue has been raised with me by a considerable number of people.</P>
      <P>I compliment all those who work in private nursing homes and State-run hospitals. I am in regular contact with the State-run hospitals in Birr, Tullamore, Abbeyleix and Mountmellick and the work of those involved is exemplary and top class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personal assistants care for persons confined to wheelchairs for life, for example, following the loss of a limb in a horrific accident. This is a time of great change in their lives and they are confronted by enormous challenges. The service pro<Col N="360" /> vided in County Offaly is excellent and those involved should be warmly congratulated. Under the scheme a personal assistant is appointed by FÁS for a period of three years at the end of which the course is discontinued despite the fact that the invalid concerned may have become dependent on the person in question. This results in a lack of continuity given that a new personal assistant has to be trained in.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Midland Health Board on its decision to assume responsibility for and to pay personal assistants on completion of a FÁS course. This is common sense and demonstrates goodwill but so far as I am aware there is no statutory obligation on it to do so. A major initiative is required in this area.</P>
    <P>I know of a 79 year old lady who had not left her home for several years and following the provision of a personal assistant she now does her own shopping, goes to church and bingo and is leading a new life. Prior to this she lived within the confines of the four walls of her home.</P>
    <P>I have visited a few of the 26 centres of independent living which do tremendous work to help those whose active lives in the community have more or less come to an end. They provide computer courses and opportunities to engage in productive and rewarding work for themselves and the community. The provision of personal assistants relieves the stress and strain placed on the family of an invalid, and that is important. Respite care and home care which are being provided in many instances are of great benefit, but it is important that the provision of personal assistants is placed on a statutory footing. I ask the Minister to make every possible effort to make sure that this is attended to at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the farm assist scheme formerly known as the small farmer's dole. Regularly I meet people who are under severe financial pressure. These are small farmers who really do not have enough to eat and they are unable to provide proper heating in their homes. Their lives are very tough. They have little or no income, and yet when their means are assessed they are refused unemployment assistance. This area needs to be closely examined. The Minister must re-examine the means test being imposed on farmers. I note that this scheme extends to fishermen also but I do not have contact with them. I have received representations from a considerable number of people who have found that the manner of calculation of the farm assist scheme is unfair and too rigid, having regard to the capital allowances, the moneys they receive, etc. I find the appeals procedure most unsatisfactory. Will the Minister conduct a careful examination of the method of assessing the applicant's income because it is too severe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in carer's benefit, although they might have been more generous. The means test on carers needs to be examined also. As with the farm assist scheme, the means test is severe. Where a woman is looking after a relative, her husband's income is taken into <Col N="361" /> account. This must be carefully examined to see how it can be made more accessible.</P>
    <P>The one area in which the budget and the Finance Bill is wrong is in regard to widows. I said that at the outset. Will the Minister look closely to see how the situation can be improved for widows and widowers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>While one can pick flaws in it, the overall thrust of the Bill is an improvement for those on social welfare or the lower rungs of the ladder. The Social Welfare Bill, 2000, provides for an increase in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments, child benefit and family income supplement, changes in the method of assessment of capital, and introduces new schemes in the area of the carer's benefit.</P>
      <P>Caring for the elderly has been placed at the top of the agenda by the Government and the Bill provides for many improvements in this area. It provides for an increase of £7 per week for pensioners aged 66 or over and for people on retirement or invalidity pensions aged 65 or over. A special increase of £5.90 is being provided for in the standard rate of invalidity pensions. Provisions are made for increases in the rates of qualifying adult allowances ranging from £3.80 to £8.50. All other weekly personal rates of social insurance and social assistance payments have been increased by £4 per week.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the introduction of a new social insurance scheme of carer's benefit, as announced in the budget. This new scheme is designed to facilitate and support people who wish to leave the workforce temporarily to care for older people or people with disabilities in need of full-time care and attention. The proposed new benefit will be available to those who are in employment for at least three months and working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight prior to commencement of full-time caring duties, and those who satisfy certain contribution conditions. All PRSI contribution classes will be covered by the new scheme with the exception of the self-employed and those earning less than £30 per week. The new scheme will be closely linked to the means tested carer's allowance scheme. The weekly rate of payment under this scheme will be £88.50, in line with the rate of carer's allowance payable to carers aged 66 or over. The benefit will be payable for a period of up to 15 months in respect of the same carer recipient, during which time the carer's employment right will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance and the benefits contained in the budget and this Bill go a good distance, but there is a long way to go. The Government and its officials are coming to the conclusion that infrastructure and moneys must be made available by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Department Finance to ensure that older people can be facilitated in their own homes as long as this is possible and practi<Col N="362" /> cal. Provided one can provide the care and the opportunities necessary for older people, it is easier to cater for them at home because people are happier in their own homes. I welcome this aspect of the Bill. I know there is much to be done yet and that the Government and the various Ministers concerned are looking at this in detail.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for a number of improvements in the means test for the farm assist scheme. This scheme was new a year ago. It was created as a result of the severe difficulties which farmers were encountering due to cattle prices and the fodder shortages during 1998. At present a farmer's net income from self-employment is assessed at 80%. In addition, where the farmer has child dependants, an amount of £100 for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child is disregarded. This section provides for a reduction in the assessment rate of 80% to 70%, and an increase of £100 in the amount of income disregarded for child benefits.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important scheme. It is doing a power of good in combating poverty in rural areas. For so long we have seen in urban areas where people have been put into poverty traps, but this scheme is helping to alleviate a certain amount of rural poverty which is attached to agriculture and small farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions regarding bereavements, which were contained in the budget and which are followed through in the Bill, and the improvement in the six weeks death payments where the arrangements are to be as follows. Where both partners are getting a retirement or an old age contributory pension in their own right, the survivor will be paid six weeks' payment of the deceased person's pension. No payments in that regard are made currently.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that I, and my predecessor, have met with Parents for Justice on a number of occasions. I have learnt at first hand of their trauma and distress on discovering that the organs of their children had been removed and retained, and in some cases disposed of, without their knowledge or consent.</P>
      <P>I want to place on record my sincere regret and offer my sympathies to all those parents affected for what has happened. My primary concern to date has been to ensure that parents and families affected by the recent disclosures receive all necessary support, including where appropriate independent counselling services. This is in addition to the support which has already been put in place by the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and other health boards.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that on 9 February 2000, I announced my intention to hold an inquiry into issues relating to post-mortem examinations, organ removal, organ retention and organ disposal at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the national centre for paediatric cardiac surgery. Since then I have been in consultation with a number of parties, including the Attorney General regarding the terms of reference, scope and form of the inquiry. Indeed, I met with Parents for Justice again yesterday evening to update them on progress in relation to the establishment of the inquiry and to listen to their views on the subject.</P>
      <P>It is now apparent that the practices and procedures followed by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in this area were not confined to that hospital. While I have yet to finalise the terms of reference for the inquiry, I can assure the Deputies that the inquiry will provide for a review of post mortem policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970 and, in particular as it relates to organ removal, retention and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both inside and outside of the State, as well as an examination of the application of these policies, practices and procedures in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. I also intend that the inquiry will be empowered to examine any specific cases in any hospital in the State as it deems appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipate that the terms of reference of the inquiry will be finalised in the very near future and I am concerned that it should commence as speedily as possible. While I appreciate that guidelines covering post mortem practices have recently been issued by the faculty of pathology, the outcome of the inquiry will also influence future policy and practice in this area. I also intend to establish a working party to advise on <Col N="364" /> any legislative requirements in this area and in particular on the updating of the existing legislation regarding human tissue.</P>
    <P>A decision has not yet been taken on the person or persons to conduct the inquiry. I consider this matter to be of major importance and I am concerned that the issues arising should be addressed in a way which will have full regard to the sensitivities of the parents and families concerned. In all the circumstances, therefore, and particularly in the best interests of all the families affected, I consider it best to refrain from commenting on the detail of the allegations and so forth which have been made and, in that respect, await the outcome of the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that it seems the removal of organs, tissue and glands without parental consent, sadly, occurred not only in Crumlin children's hospital but also in Temple Street and other hospitals in the State? In the circumstances, will he acknowledge that the inquiry, which should now be conducted, should be broader than simply an inquiry into Crumlin children's hospital?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it is crucial that the fullest information is available to ensure the inquiry reaches conclusions based on the facts of what occurred and that it has the most comprehensive information available to it? In that regard, will the Minister acknowledge that the most appropriate form of inquiry is a statutory one which gives the person or persons appointed to act in the inquiry specific powers to gain access to all relevant information so as to ensure no difficulty arises?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that there is a need to put in place a new legislative and regulatory framework to ensure a considered, sensitive and appropriate approach to post mortem issues and to organ retention? Will the Minister indicate what progress, if any, has been made in considering the type of legislation necessary not only confined to issues relating to the Coroner's Court but also legislation necessary to address this area in circumstances in which the coroner is not called in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, it is envisaged that the terms of reference for the inquiry will embrace more than Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and that practice generally throughout the country will come within the remit of the inquiry. On the facts, records and so on, it is important the inquiry has access to all records in the hospitals and that all information in the hospitals concerned will be made available to the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On whether we take a statutory or non-statutory route, it is a matter on which I am reflecting. I do not necessarily accept that the statutory route is the only one to ensure we have access to all the documentation or co-operation from all concerned. There is a number of considerations and I discussed this yesterday with Parents for <Col N="365" /> Justice. Their legal representatives made it clear to us that they were looking for a statutory inquiry. The length of time the statutory inquiry would take to establish and, indeed, could potentially take to conduct its activities is a matter of concern to me. There is much trauma arising out of this issue. It is important we genuinely look at how the format of an inquiry will impact on people. The duration in that sense is an issue. At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, I said I would take on board what the legal representatives and Parents for Justice said in regard to their concerns on that issue.</P>
    <P>We have been promised full co-operation from all parties concerned and it is an issue which we will obviously have to finalise in terms of further consultations between the groups concerned, in particular Parents for Justice, and the Attorney General. We can tease out these issues further if the Deputy wishes but I do not accept that the only way forward is <i>via</i> a statutory inquiry. That has other difficulties as well.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a need for a legislative framework in relation to human tissue generally. I intend to set up a working party with people who have particular expertise in this field to set about preparing proposals for a human tissues Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to set up an inquiry. It is very important in addressing the anguish which has been expressed by so many parents on this issue. I expected more progress in terms of outlining to us how and when the inquiry would be established. Will the Minister outline whether he is talking about one, two or three months? What type of time frame is he talking about? I do not intend to hang it around his neck but it is important people have some time frame no matter how broad.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that current practice in relation to organ retention is appropriate and is standard throughout all hospitals? While I welcome his general view on legislation, I presume he is aware an extensive case has been made on the drawing up of legislation on the handling of human tissues. There is a concern that setting up a working group is extending the time unduly. Is he not satisfied that, between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the work being done by the coroner's review group and his Department, there is sufficient expertise to set about drawing up the legislation given that other jurisdictions appear to have been able to do so? The undue delay is a matter of concern, particularly to professionals working in the field who want to do things properly. At the moment there is a lacuna which should be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made fairly quick progress. I met with Parents for Justice twice. At the first meeting they were genuinely surprised when we told them we were going to have an inquiry. Obviously it was too early at that stage for both them and others to reflect on the nature of that <Col N="366" /> inquiry. We made a commitment to consult again with the groups, in particular with Parents for Justice, before we come to any definitive conclusions. It is not a secret that yesterday's meeting concentrated on whether we should have a statutory or non-statutory inquiry. The legal representatives present argued strongly in favour of the statutory inquiry model, while I made strong arguments in favour of the advantages of a non-statutory inquiry. I gave a commitment to reflect on the content of yesterday's meeting. In that regard, I am not talking about months but weeks.</P>
      <P> From my experience in the Department of Education and Science of setting about establishing the commission of inquiry into child abuse, I am confident that will be achieved with the best efforts of everyone involved. We gave a commitment to set up a statutory inquiry in May of last year and it will be in place and on the Statute Book in approximately 12 months. That legislation is currently going through the House.</P>
      <P>These are issues about which we should inform people before we take decisions. That is why the expected time frame of not only the establishment of the inquiry but its duration is an issue not only for Parents for Justice but for parents generally.</P>
      <P>The faculty of pathology has issued guidelines to inform current practice. We have written to each health board and hospital on the issue of informed consent. The faculty's guidelines, which were issued only recently, will inform current practice.</P>
      <P>In terms of the working party, there is a fairly comprehensive legislative programme within the Department's area of responsibility. I would be concerned about our capacity to deliver on all of that. In this area in particular some work has been done on coroners, post-mortems and so on and we can use that, but to get it right by putting in place a comprehensive legislative framework, the prudent approach is to establish a working party with people of sufficient expertise who can quickly bring proposals to the table. Some people consider that is procrastinating on the issue, but I do not. I give a commitment to the House that the working party will not have an unduly long period within which to submit its proposals and a template for legislation. It might help to fast-track the process.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, was published by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, on 4 February last. The Bill includes a provision which establishes an investigation committee and this committee will have full powers to compel witnesses and to discover documents &ndash; powers similar to those of the High Court.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that my Department will co-operate fully with the commission and with the investigation committee to be established. All relevant records will be made available and work on assembling these has commenced. There has also been contact between my Department and the secretariat of the commission on this issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to health boards, they are separate statutory bodies and while I do not have an intermediary role, I expect to be in touch with the health boards to ensure full compliance with the work of the commission of inquiry. It will have powers to compel the discovery of documents, the compellability of witnesses and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that when the commission of inquiry finally gets under way it is important it should be able to carry out its work as satisfactorily and as speedily as possible. Does he agree it should not be impeded in that work by Government Departments or health boards? In that context, the Minister was the initiator of the commission of inquiry and he had my full support on that. He will be aware that the Department of Education and Science started collating information on reports of child abuse some considerable time ago. Will he confirm when the Department of Health and Children commenced collating the necessary information and documentation to be given to the commission? Will he clarify how many years such collation dates back? What is the extent of the look back programme in this context? Will he acknowledge that in the interests of ensuring the work of the commission proceeds efficiently, a direction should issue from his Department to each health board to commence collating all such relevant information and documentation going back over a specified period of years because if that does not occur the work of this commission could be substantially delayed by health boards not having done the necessary preparatory work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The secretariat of the commission had been in touch with the Department before I arrived in Hawkins House. The Department has gone through documentation that is of relevance to the inquiry. Documents are held in the Department, the National Archives and in storage. The documents in storage were removed recently from O'Connell Bridge House. They are being indexed and relevant files have been held for the purpose of the inquiry. A database with approximately 9,500 index cards has been set up. There are working files on institutions such as Golden<Col N="368" /> bridge and so forth in the Department and these contain information on matters relating to funding and so on as opposed to details on individuals. The bulk of documents on records of children who attended these institutions are in the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in issuing a directive but we should remember health boards are statutory bodies in their own right and have a duty and a responsibility to obey the law and to co-operate fully with the work of the commission of inquiry into child abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

Will he agree that he should be aware that in years gone by people who were abused in residential institutions had such abuse reported to health boards from time to time and it is important information contained in the files of health boards going back a number of decades is gone through and collated in the same efficient manner that the Minister informed us is happening in the Department of Health and Children and started some considerable time ago in the Department of Education and Science? It is in the public interest that the health boards are not merely alerted to the need to do this but commence this work that has not commenced to date within any health board.</P>

In relation to the Deputy's point, I will take the matter up again with the health boards.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>his views on an average waiting time of two years for paediatric heart surgery; and the action, if any, he will take to ensure all necessary paediatric heart surgery is speedily undertaken.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is the national paediatric cardiac centre and my Department has been aware that there has been concern over waiting times for children in this speciality. The development of this speciality at the hospital has been the subject of discussions with my Department and the hospital for some time.</P>
      <P>Some of the measures cited by the hospital as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service were the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and intervention techniques available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1997 the hospital was allocated a sum of £500,000 from the cardiac waiting list <Col N="369" /> initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in the most effective and appropriate manner. The hospital proposed to use the funding for a number of measures. These included the provision of an additional four ICU beds, the implementation of a training programme for ICU nurses and the purchase of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In 1998 and in 1999 under the same initiative the hospital was allocated sums of £878,550 and £340,000 respectively. In addition, approval for a third cardiac surgeon has issued, the recruitment procedure has been finalised and the selected candidate is expected to take up duty in July this year.  Included in the hospital's allocation for 2000 is the provision of £0.7 million to continue the initiative and the details of the funding will be discussed with the hospital in the context of their service plan for 2000.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that hospital's cardiac surgical capacity should be increased and in this regard a design team for the theatre development has been appointed. When completed, the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The estimated completion date for the development is 2002.</P>
    <P>The waiting times referred to by the Deputy are for non-urgent cases only. It is important to note that the prioritisation of the waiting list is a matter for the clinicians concerned and that immediate medical treatment is provided to all urgent cases.</P>
    <P>I am confident the appointment of additional consultant staff and the completion of the theatre development will have a positive impact on the reduction of waiting times in this speciality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that it is a national scandal, in the context of the prosperity of this country, that any child should have to wait an average waiting time of two years for cardiac surgery? Would he acknowledge that the current difficulties in this area have resulted in approximately 100 children on the cardiac surgery waiting list, and perhaps the Minister would confirm the exact up-to-date position in that regard? Would he acknowledge that the total failure of the Government to provide resources at the Crumlin Children's Hospital at a much earlier stage has resulted in there being little prospect of any substantial reduction in waiting times or in the paediatric cardiac surgery waiting list until after 2002, and that that is entirely unacceptable? Would the Minister indicate what steps he intends to take during the course of this year to <Col N="370" /> ensure there is a very substantial reduction in the number of children on the cardiac waiting list and a substantial reduction in waiting times?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unacceptable that children should have to wait an average of two years for cardiac surgery, irrespective of the nature of the surgery in terms of urgency and so forth. I do not want to engage in party-political dispute on this, but the bottom line is that capacity is a key issue at this hospital. I have outlined what we intend to do in terms of the capacity issue, which is to increase surgical capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have been done perhaps five years ago, when Deputy Shatter's party was in Government. From 1997 onwards, significant progress has been made in terms of making additional finance available, which could have been done in 1996 or in 1995 &ndash; I do not know why it was not. One thing I have discovered in three or four weeks in the Department of Health and Children is that there is a lead-in time both in terms of the provision of additional human resources and in terms of equipment and buildings. We are doing everything we can to increase the surgical capacity. A decision was taken in 1997-98 to take interim measures in terms of increased funding under the waiting list initiative pending the working up of design teams and the completion of the extension. Those involved referring children to the United Kingdom. We have 96 public patients awaiting cardiac surgery procedures. Fourteen have been waiting for up to three months, 19 have been waiting for between three and six months, and 63 have been waiting for more than six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that this waiting list has escalated during the Government's term of office, that the extent to which it has escalated is entirely unacceptable, and that the strains under which parents are being put as a consequence of children having to await cardiac surgery are unacceptable? These were well illustrated in a story in the <i>Evening Herald</i> yesterday about a young child who has been on a waiting list for some 15 months on very expensive medicines for which the parents can no longer afford to pay. Does the Minister acknowledge that the plight of such parents is something which this Government has failed to address?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>One issue that my predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, was both committed to and concerned about was that of children within the health system, and accelerating the provision of <Col N="371" /> services for children right across the board, particularly in relation to cardiac facilities and cardiac surgery. We made a crucial decision. The only way to ensure we can reduce waiting lists is to increase surgical capacity and to increase the human resources available within the hospital, which we have done.</P>

      <Quest>if he will engage in discussions with Dublin Corporation to bring about an agreement whereby general medical practitioners calling to patients are not impeded by having their vehicles at risk of being clamped.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues of parking enforcement and clamping are not matters, either generally or specifically, that fall within my area of responsibility as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>However, given the issue raised by the Deputy, it is important that the matter should be considered in the context of all relevant factors. Accordingly, I am referring the matter to the Eastern Health Board, being the appropriate body for matters relating to service provision in the Dublin area, for its consideration and such follow-up action, as it thinks appropriate, including discussions with Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I understand the Irish Medical Organisation raised the matter with Dublin Corporation around the time clamping was introduced and also recently met officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I will liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, with a view to resolving any service issues which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that when medical practitioners have to go out to patients who are seriously ill, it poses a great health danger if their vehicles are at risk of being clamped and as a consequence they are prevented from visiting other patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister acknowledge also that, to date, despite the best endeavours of the Irish Medical Organisation, neither Dublin Corporation nor the Department of the Environment and Local Government have been receptive to representations made to them? Would he now recognise that this is an urgent health issue across Dublin? Would he seek to ensure that he is not regarded at the &ldquo;Minister for medical clamping&rdquo;, by taking an initiative to break the bureaucratic <Col N="372" /> logjam which has resulted in each of the different agencies involved failing to address this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be beyond the capacity of Dublin Corporation to resolve this matter. It is a statutory body. We are great at saying we want devolution and regionalisation, but when bodies are established we still want to tell them what to do. Dublin Corporation should resolve this issue. The cars of general practitioners should not be clamped when they call to patients in the Dublin area. The matter has not been raised with the Eastern Health Board. That raises questions about the urgency of the matter. Those concerned should raise this both at Eastern Health Board level and with Dublin Corporation. Notwithstanding that, I cannot see why Dublin Corporation could not bring in something similar to residents' permits for GPs to facilitate them in carrying out their duties.</P>
      <P>I understand that there seems to be significant blockage within Dublin Corporation and a strong stance has been taken on the issue because of the fear that it would lead to abuse. However, lest there be any risk to patients, this practice should not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the IMO has proposed to Dublin Corporation that a special disk system be put in place to facilitate medical practitioners? Would the Minister agree that it is time Dublin Corporation addressed this issue, before he has to come back to this House as a consequence of a tragedy befalling some family because somebody loses their life as a consequence of their doctor not getting to their home in time because the corporation has arranged for his or her vehicle to be clamped?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cervical screening programme is being introduced on a phased basis. It is anticipated that phase one of the programme <Col N="373" /> will commence mid-year in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are currently under way with the IMO in relation to the fee to be paid to GPs involved in taking smears. I hope the negotiations can be concluded in the near future to avoid any undue delay in implementing phase one of the programme. Phase one will involve 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>An expert advisory committee on cervical screening is overseeing the implementation of phase one. The process of planning and organising the phased introduction of the national programme will be greatly facilitated by the experience gained in phase one. In light of the organisational and resource implications, there would appear to be merit in a phased introduction of the national programme. Approximately 800,000 women will be involved. The introduction of subsequent phases of the programme will require the development of population based registers and the availability of adequate laboratory capacity, appropriate quality assurance and follow-up services where treatment is required. These issues are currently being considered in conjunction with the expert advisory committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many women who need screening but who do not live in Limerick. There is a commitment to extend this scheme nationally. Cervical screening is recognised worldwide as one of the very few testing programmes that is extremely effective. What knowledge precisely will be garnered from having the pilot scheme in Limerick that has not already been gained from practice elsewhere where screening is a <i>fait accompli</i>? Will he indicate what kind of time frame we are talking about for a national screening programme? I am not referring to the pilot scheme. What resources and funding are being put in place this year? What expansion of laboratory and colposcopy facilities is being provided this year to prepare for the establishment of the national programme? </P>

      <P>Phase one is an important first step towards the full operation of the programme. The experience gained will help to inform the subsequent developmental expansion of the programme nationally. There are organisational issues which have resource implications for the future expansion of the programme but we are committed to it. I am also anxious to use the experience gained in phase one in subsequent follow-up treatment services, which are equally important. The expert committee is to report back to me on all these issues. I am awaiting its report which is will be considered in the context of the national cancer strategy and the work of the national cancer forum.</P>

What steps does the Minister propose taking to ensure that his Department loses the <i>mañana</i> philosophy of life and starts regarding these issues as urgent priorities which require it to put programmes in place a great deal faster than the many years it seems to take them to do so from the date when such plans are announced?</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point and I am reflecting on the way in which things operate generally within the health system &ndash; not just within the Department. Matters apparently take a long time to implement and, even in terms of sanctioning posts, there seems to be an inordinate delay.</P>

      <P>When we sanction consultant posts it can sometimes take up to 12 months before the positions are filled, even though funding is available. That situation is not tenable and I want to see something done about it. The Deputy would have to acknowledge that some progress has been made on implementing the national cancer strategy. We need to make more progress, however. We are approaching the matter against a background of a significant deficit in cancer services. There is a need to correlate screening programmes with subsequent follow-up treatments. I am conscious that in the area of radiotherapy we need to expand capacity significantly, otherwise new log-jams will emerge in the national screening programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it was agreed to conduct a review of bed capacity in both acute and non-acute settings. Integral components of this review of capacity will be examinations of the day work carried out in hospitals with a view to establishing the adequacy and appropriateness of day care facilities, given the 9-10% per annum increase in day activity in recent years, and the organisation and use of operating theatre facilities with a view to possible increased efficiency in the area.</P>
      <P>Both the Beaumont and Mater hospitals and their respective catchment areas will be examined in the course of the reviews and the outcome will facilitate the Eastern Regional Health Authority, within whose functional area both hospitals operate, in determining future policy for the planning of acute hospitals services in the entire region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Callely for tabling the question which I am sure the Minister found most helpful. Does the Minister accept that we are not properly using existing resources within either the Mater or Beaumont hospitals? Our failure to properly use existing resources within each of those hospitals is to the detriment of patients and is contributing to a substantial escalation in the in-patient hospital list. Would he agree that it is entirely unacceptable that 8,536 bed days were lost in Beaumont Hospital last year as a result of beds being closed? Last year also, some 21,000 bed days were lost in the Mater Hospital. Does the Minister acknowledge that these hospitals would be better staffed and resourced if the Government confronted the reality of nursing shortages in Dublin so that these beds could be properly utilised and the waiting list difficulties would be substantially tackled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the responsibility for organising services within the region lies with the Eastern Health Board &ndash; now the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Seasonal bed closures have been a feature of the health service for a long time. There has been a significant increase in the volume of activity in all the acute hospitals throughout the country, but particularly <Col N="376" /> in the Dublin region. A number of strands are involved if we are to make progress in resolving both the waiting list and the accident and emergency issues. Those strands include increased capacity and more effective and efficient organisational structures in hospitals, particularly for the accident and emergency services. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a review of bed capacity with our acute hospital services, which is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a very serious shortage of hospital beds? Ireland has the lowest <i>per capita</i> figure of any OECD country. In terms of planning to meet the crisis that now exists, he is not helping by not knowing, or not telling us, what is the current waiting list. We do not have information for December 1999. It is extraordinary that information needed for proper planning is not being provided by his Department.</P>
      <P>Also, does the Minister accept that it is the Department of Health and Children that is responsible for planning, budgeting and funding hospitals to ensure there is patient care? In terms of growth in patient care and numbers, does the Minister accept that day patients are getting more treatment, not overnight patients? That is a critical matter when it comes to serious procedures such as cardiac surgery or cancer treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>International trends as well as trends here reflect the significant increase in day cases. That is a factor in the issues raised by Deputy Shatter. There is an ongoing drive in terms of efficiency, turnover and so on. We are setting up the Eastern Regional Health Authority which will have statutory authority for the delivery of services in the region. We either decide to have a proper regional statutory authority to deliver health services in accordance with service plans, proper planning, initiatives and so on, or we do not.

      <P>Following its publication in September 1999, the Green Paper on Abortion was referred to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution for consideration. The question of whether there should be a further referendum and, if so, its nature, are matters which the committee is considering in the course of its work.</P>
      <P>I understand that the deBorda Institute has made a number of submissions to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee. The institute promotes inclusive voting procedures and believes that the democratic process should facilitate the identification, from a broad range of options, of that policy proposal which has the highest average preference score of every vote. It sees the deBorda preferendum as the relevant voting procedure to achieve that. The institute has, among its submissions, made one that proposes a non-binding multi-option deBorda preferendum vote prior to any binding two option referendum, in the event of a referendum on abortion. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution will examine this in its consideration of the abortion issue. The Government will await the outcome of the committee's deliberations before further considering the issues discussed in the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>I accept that. I was a little perplexed. Newspapers report the Taoiseach as saying there will be a referendum and I ask the Minister to address those reports. Has there been a commitment given to any Member to have a referendum within the lifetime of this Government? That is a very simple question. I ask the Minister to comment on the medical aspects of a now extensive practice within this country whereby on average 15 women travel to England every day for terminations. Does the Minister have a view on the extensive nature of abortion &ndash; Irish abortion, in effect? Is he taking the recommendations from research on crisis pregnancies, which were not published and which his predecessor was unwilling to publish, and is he going to work on a strategy that ensures there is a reduction in the numbers of Irish women having terminations? Will he also ensure that doctors are protected, given a clear statement from the Master of the Rotunda Hospital that terminations are being carried out here to save women's lives? Does he have a view on the protection of the professional practice of Irish doctors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. We are committed to protecting Irish doctors in terms of practices and to developing strategies in relation to crisis pregnancies, public education and so forth. Regarding the Government's commitment to resolve this issue within the lifetime of this Government, we endeavoured and were anxious to achieve consensus on the issue and we published a Green Paper following the work of the interdepartmental committee. That now rests with the all-party committee and the Taoiseach made it clear in his interview that that matter rests with that committee and that he did not want to proceed in advance of that committee's deliberations and conclusions. We are now awaiting the committee's work on that issue and we will proceed from then onwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister addressed my point at the end of his reply. My question was whether he would agree that the 100,000 submissions made to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution deserved to be fully considered before a full decision was made. Those people made their submissions in good faith and it is their understanding &ndash; and that of the committee &ndash; that those submissions are taken into account before a decision is made on proceeding with a referendum or whether it is necessary to have a referendum in conjunction with legislative change. Deputy McManus is a member of that committee and I believe it is the understanding of the committee that that is the procedure which will be followed &ndash; that the committee will consider the submissions, make its recommendations and the issue will then be dealt with.</P>

      <P>That is the position as I understand it. Approximately 105,000 submissions were made to the committee, an extraordinary number, and I understand they are close to finalising the analysis of that documentation. It is a matter for the committee to decide how soon it will progress the issues involved and in what timeframe it will operate. It is important and the Taoiseach made it clear in the article referred to by Deputy McManus that he was anxious to achieve consensus on the issue.

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not currently available. However, the working group on foster care, which was set up to examine all aspects of foster care, has issued a questionnaire to all foster carers covering a wide range of issues, including the issue of breakdowns in foster care arrangements. I understand the result of this survey will be published and the group will make recommendations on this issue when it reports later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that all children in the care of the health boards receive the best possible care. This Government has shown its commitment to the further development of these services. It has invested an additional £55 million approximately in revenue in these services since 1998. The allowances for foster care have been significantly increased over this period. In 1997 the allowance for a child under 12 years of age was £57.75 per week, today it is £68.05 per week. In the case of a child over the age of 12, the 1997 allowance was £64.60 per week and today it is £75.35 per week. In 1998 a special bonus of £100 was introduced <Col N="382" /> for each child in care at Christmas and this bonus was again paid in 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, six pilot projects in foster care have been launched. These deal with the recruitment and training of foster carers, relative fostering and fostering of children with behavioural difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is this Government's policy to ensure the proper provision of the range of preventative, supportive, child protection and alternative care services, to provide a continuum of care for children in need and their families. This includes the further development of the foster care services and I await the report of the working group on foster care with interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the significant variations between hospitals in Ireland in the rate of procedures such as caesarean sections. While some element of such variation can usually be explained by reference to the complexity of cases being dealt with, it is important that the reasons <Col N="383" /> for remaining variations be understood and explained. Accordingly, I have asked my Department's chief medical officer to seek the views of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as the organisation with professional responsibility for standards in this area. As with all medical interventions, caesarean sections should only be undertaken for sound clinical reasons in the interest of both mothers and babies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is an extraordinary disparity where, in certain hospitals, a woman has a one in four chance of having a caesarean delivery and in other cases it is as little as one in eight? Generally speaking, there seems to be a correlation between the high level of caesarean sections and private hospitals. Has the Minister any views on the fact that generally we are above what the WHO regards as an acceptable level of 15%? While I am glad the Minister is consulting the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists would he not agree that there is considerable disagreement between obstetricians on this issue and there are some who articulate the view that if a woman wants a caesarean section she should be entitled to have one whereas others would argue strenuously that there are serious risks attached to having a caesarean delivery? It requires the Minister to put forward a policy on caesarean sections in maternity hospitals, after consultations, to ensure best practice is adhered to.</P>

There is a wide variation between hospitals, as the survey by Cuidiú has established, from 12.5% in the National Maternity Hospital to 25% in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny. The World Health Organisation estimates that complications arise in at least 15% of all pregnancies. I am concerned but at the same time it is important to have full consultation with the body responsible in terms of professional standards and so on. I am obliged to consult with the professionals involved. I accept that there are differences in emphasis in terms of approaches by different obstetricians. The Department's chief medical officer has sought the views of the institute. Following receipt of those and further consideration, I will be interested in developing the right approach to this issue, in terms of the health of mothers and babies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed by the Minister and Deputy McManus. I assume the Minister would agree that there should not be such a huge disparity in the number of caesareans in different maternity hospitals. There can be circumstances whereby a different number of operations may occasionally occur on an annual basis. Does the Minister agree that these variations are <Col N="384" /> sufficiently substantial for genuine public concern? Does he agree that it was in the public interest that all hospitals asked to co-operate in the preparation of this report which resulted in this information did so? Does he regard it as acceptable that Tralee General Hospital failed to co-operate and was the only hospital providing maternity services which failed to provide information to the group which prepared the Cuidiú report? It should now be asked to make the missing information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department supports the work of the Irish Childbirth Trust. It is desirable that hospitals co-operate with the trust regarding surveys of this kind. Public information on hospital procedures is important. However, variations can occur because of different volumes of activity and the different nature of some hospital services. The prudent approach is to ensure there is full consultation with the professionals involved and that we work with them and those representing mothers and pregnant women to develop the best possible service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 27, 29, 39, 139, 148 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>The authorities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, have informed me that for many years there was no medical treatment for the condition commonly known as short stature. In the early 1960s a growth hormone was developed in the United States using human pituitary gland as a source. Pharmaceutical companies were involved in the development and a national pituitary agency was set up in the USA to make the manufacture of growth hormone and prepare it for injection. In Ireland hospitals were involved in the effort to avail of this growth hormone product, there being no other way to treat children with this condition other than the pituitary gland derived product at that time.</P>
      <P>The hospital understands that a significant number of glands were required to produce a small amount of the product and that the treatment to children involved multiple injections over a lengthy period of time. Development in genetics in or about 1985 allowed that human growth hormone could be produced without extracting the material from the pituitary gland. The hospital also understands that about the same time health concerns arose in relation to the growth hormone product from the pituitary gland. The hospital has confirmed that there is an indication in correspondence located in its laboratory that the laboratory participated in this process of extracting pituitary glands which were then supplied to a pharmaceutical company called Kabi Vitrum to produce growth hormone for the treatment of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between June 1980 and November 1981 a contribution towards the cost of the work of extracting the glands was made by the pharmaceutical company in question. The contribution <Col N="386" /> identified is £109.50 which was payable to the Children's Research Centre; however the correspondence does not indicate the number of pituitary glands supplied to the company or the number of deceased children affected by this procedure.</P>
    <P>The remainder of my reply is identical to the reply to Questions Nos. 1 and 2 and relates to the establishment of an inquiry which will examine specific cases in any hospital where it deems appropriate. A number of the questions relate to different hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with in Priority Questions. I exhort the Minister to establish the inquiry as quickly as possible and clarify its terms of reference and whether it will be statutory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the trauma of organs, tissue and pituitary glands being removed without parental consent, does the Minister acknowledge that the information which has become available raises concerns about the record keeping capacity of hospitals? It is necessary to ensure that proper records are maintained and collated over a period of years. Will the Minister indicate what instructions, if any, have emanated from his Department since this upsetting issue arose to ensure our hospitals are maintaining better and more accurate records than previously? Does the Minister acknowledge that it is not acceptable that the remains of a baby born in 1980 cannot be traced by St. James' Hospital? Has the Minister investigated how this occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that record keeping is essential and past record keeping appears to be at issue. When the initial questions were tabled by Deputies John Browne and John McGuinness, the hospital in question made the records available to the departmental official who made the inquiry. The hospital was not reluctant in making the correspondence available, which highlighted the retention of pituitary glands and so on. I know from meetings with Parents for Justice and officials, that records for the past 30 or 40 years are not comprehensive. I could not put my hand on my heart and state that every hospital could produce records going back that far.</P>
      <P>We have discussed the establishment of an inquiry with the chief executives of the health boards and ensuring that records are up to date. We must also ensure that health boards and hospitals have technological resources to enable them have proper data collection capacity. This is critical not only as regards records but in terms of formulating informed policy responses. Data collection and storage in the health system need to be significantly improved. The 1980s case is not acceptable. The inquiry will take all these matters on board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Throughout the six months from December 1998 to May 1999, officials from my Department and the General Medical Services Payments Board conducted negotiations with community pharmacists on the basis that drug payments scheme claims would be transmitted electronically to the board. It was accepted that not all pharmacies would be in a position to conduct business electronically immediately, but given that more than 200 were at that time transmitting GMS claims electronically each month and the numbers were increasing, it was expected that, with the launch of the drug payments scheme, the number of pharmacies with this facility would have increased considerably. It would appear that not all pharmacies had been provided by their system suppliers with the facility to communicate electronically with the GMS Payments Board.</P>
      <P>In early June 1999 my Department was informed that pending resolution of a range of issues which were of concern to the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, community pharmacies were being advised not to co-operate with the proposal to transmit drug payment scheme claims electronically to the GMS Payments Board. As the scheme is of considerable benefit to a large section of the population, notably that no family or individual has to pay more than £42 per month on prescribed approved medicines, it was decided to proceed as planned with the launch of the scheme on 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>I understand that the GMS Payments Board shortly hopes to be in a position to bring all outstanding claims for payment from community pharmacists up to date and that every effort is being made to keep delays to a minimum. The problems which to date have prevented the electronic transmission of drug payment scheme claims from pharmacies to the GMS Payments Board are also being addressed.</P>

Does he acknowledge this can create financial difficulties for some pharmacists as they must meet their obligations to their suppliers and that it is not in the interests of promoting a scheme of this nature for Government agencies to be dilatory in making payments in circumstances in which there are administrative guidelines to ensure suppliers of products are paid promptly when payments are sought?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on smoking and health includes a section dealing with litigation against the tobacco industry in which it was recommended that the committee should be given powers of compellability in relation to documents and people for an inquiry into the tobacco industry. I believe this would be a very valuable exercise, the outcome of which should inform any future decision on the State's involvement in any such litigation. I have indicated to the Chief Whip that I would support the <Col N="389" /> committee's proposal. It would then be my hope that the committee would consider the interim report of the Tobacco Free Policy Group on litigation in this context.</P>
    <P>The issue of compellability is a matter for a committee of the House.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>I think it would be helpful at the outset, by way of clarification, to provide some background to the general medical services, GMS, scheme, the drug payment scheme, DPS, and the special arrangements made by health boards for the supply of certain items to medical card holders with spinal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card under the GMS scheme. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. <Col N="390" /> In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme which was introduced with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the new scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to everyone regardless of their income or financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the GMS scheme and the DPS to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. The list is subject to ongoing review and additions and deletions are made on a monthly basis. Health boards, however, make certain products which are not reimbursable under the common list available to medical card holders with spinal injuries through other separate arrangements. Some of these products, for example incontinence wear and dressings, are reimbursable under the DPS on a supplementary list basis.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to urinary products is slightly different as a range of these products are included on the common list. The GMS Payments Board, on behalf of the health boards, has carried out annual reviews of the urinary products to be reimbursable on the GMS scheme on the basis of criteria published by the board and having regard to current good practice in respect of the use of these products. This list is updated and published annually. In the interests of consistency, equity and the need for good practice only those urinary products then reimbursable on the GMS scheme were, therefore, included in the common list of reimbursable items on its introduction.</P>
    <P>However, exceptional transitional arrangements are in place with regard to the reimbursement of urinary products not included in the common list and urinary products which have been reimbursed under previous community drugs schemes continue to be reimbursed until 1 July 2000. In this regard, health boards were asked to make the necessary arrangements so that patients using urinary products which were not on the common list of reimbursable items would be assessed by the appropriate health board professional personnel, with a view to facilitating the <Col N="391" /> appropriate changes in product usage. Some patients may be using older appliances and accessories not reimbursable on the GMS scheme and other patients may be using appliances which are reimbursable in association with accessories which are not reimbursable.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be pleased to learn that my Department is examining arrangements for the supply to DPS patients of certain other products made available by health boards to medical card holders with spinal injuries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, as there is supposed to be a common list between two schemes, that items available to those who suffer spinal cord injury and who qualify for a medical card should be available to those who do not qualify for a medical card under the drug payment scheme? Is the Minister aware of a letter forwarded to his Department on 6 January 2000 detailing a series of items which the health boards are now making available to those suffering spinal cord injury and who are eligible for medical cards but which do not come under the drug payments scheme? In the interests of maintaining co-ordination or symmetry between the two schemes, will he arrange that those additional items, as listed by the Spinal Injuries Action Association, be included to fall under the drug payments scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the new partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am proud to say that I have a particular personal association with the development of the partnership process and I am glad to continue that involvement now as Partnership 2000 draws to an end.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on the programme were held against the background of the recent NESC report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice, which maps a vision for Ireland in the early years of the new millennium. The report restated, in our current environment, the basic reality on which the partnership process is based, namely a recognition of the fact that we must compete successfully in a global economy; that our actions and policies must be consistent with that competitive challenge and with each other, and that consistency of approach over time must be underpinned by a consensus based on the fairness of the outcomes.</P>
      <P>There is a temptation in times of prosperity to forget these basic facts. We may assume that past economic success is a guarantee of continuing prosperity. We might conclude that maximising wage increases in one company or sector can be achieved without affecting the rest of the economy or the security of jobs. We might believe that policies on taxation and expenditure can be insulated from the labour market or wage increases. We might want to pause or slow down the pace of change on structural reform, thinking that we have done enough already.</P>
      <P>Such complacency would be disastrous. We could, all too easily, slip back into old ways of leap-frogging pay claims, irresponsible fiscal policies or undermining our stated goals through inconsistent behaviour. As the NESC pointed out, we now have a capacity to make choices; we are no longer constrained by the external pressures of crisis in the public finances or of unemployment or of qualifying for membership of economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> The challenge we face as a society is to make the right choices, to seize the opportunities to sustain our recent success. More than that, we have the opportunity to transform the quality of life of our people. This is about tackling effectively the consequences of economic success; developing our infrastructure; bringing about real balance between the regions, and between urban and rural communities; and developing real global strengths in R&amp;D and the information society. It is also about ending the exclusion of blackspot neighbourhoods, tackling school drop-out rates and literacy problems and giving a second chance to those who missed out on our recent economic boom.</P>
    <P>The Government has recognised this challenge. It brought forward initiatives, such as the national minimum wage, as a radical step towards a fairer Ireland. It conceived and brought to reality a national development plan with unprecedented but realistic ambitions to transform this country over the next seven years, largely based on our own resources and supported by the EU investments which we negotiated. It has also negotiated this ambitious new programme with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Government has faithfully and fully implemented the terms of Partnership 2000, even though it did not negotiate it. It recognises the value of social partnership and of continuity in the strategic direction of policy in the interests of stability and confidence. We have found that this in no way inhibited our ability to implement our programme or to meet the test of democratic accountability. It is, therefore, alarming to hear some suggestions from the Opposition that it might not feel obliged to implement the new programme if it found itself in Government. That must sound odd to the social partners. It must be worrying to all those who recognise the key role which social partnership has played in underpinning our current prosperity.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the wide-ranging nature of the new programme, the key principles underpinning it may be summarised as follows: first, to underpin Ireland's competitiveness and develop our economic prosperity on a sustainable basis; and, second, to use that increased prosperity to enhance our quality of life in the context of a fairer and more inclusive society. The new programme sets out detailed but flexible operational frameworks by which these over-arching objectives will be pursued. Over the period of the programme, up to and including budget 2003, there will be increases in net take home pay of up to 25% or more when the taxation and pay elements are taken into account.</P>
    <P>This will build on the process of tax reform already begun, especially the introduction of the tax credits system, the removal of substantial numbers of people from the top tax rate, the increase in allowances and the widening of tax bands. The new programme gives a sharper focus to the needs of people on low incomes, including the objective, over time, of removing from the tax <Col N="394" /> net all those who earn the minimum wage. Increases in tax credits and the development of the tax credit system are the priority areas for resources over the course of the programme. The programme also supports the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In the area of social inclusion, there is provision for a substantial increase in resources, amounting to £1.5 billion by 2003. The new programme, however, goes well beyond resource considerations. Many of the proposals are about getting things done, not only about spending money. Examples in that regard include the development of initiatives to maximise the involvement and participation of local communities in the democratic process; the identification of targeted intervention measures for areas where cumulative disadvantage is pervasive; the encouragement of economic and social development in rural communities; and the promotion and consolidation of the emerging social economy.</P>
    <P>Within the social inclusion area, a key component in the new programme centres on the issue of income adequacy. Substantial progress will be made over the lifetime of the programme towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare. In addition, the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments in the review of the Government's own programme. Measures such as these will mean real, tangible improvements in people's day to day lives.</P>
    <P>The new programme also involves a concerted effort to address issues affecting the quality of people's lives. In the area of housing, for example, a key action is to ensure that the supply of zoned serviced land is sufficient to support the required housing output through increased residential densities and better design where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Public transport is another key issue. The programme provides for a public transport partnership forum which will facilitate consultation on the effective delivery of the major investment initiatives set out in the national development plan. Healthcare is also an issue which is central to quality of life concerns and, for that reason, a range of measures are set out in the new programme covering, for example, hospital capacity, health promotion and services to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of public service pay, it is accepted in the programme that the traditional approach to pay reviews in the public service, based on analogues and relativities, has given rise to serious difficulties in the past. The parties are committed to making arrangements for an alternative approach which will be grounded in a coherent and broadly-based comparison to jobs and pay rates across the economy. The programme provides for the establishment of a public service benchmarking body to examine pay and jobs in the public service and across the economy and to make recommendations thereon. The <Col N="395" /> benchmarking body will be asked to produce its report and recommendations by the end of 2002 so that the parties will be in a position to discuss the implementation of its recommendations within the context of any successor to this programme, or whatever other arrangements may be in place when it expires. This represents significant progress in dealing with a very complex and long-standing issue and I welcome it as such.</P>
    <P>In addition, the programme includes provision for clear links between public service pay and the implementation of the modernisation programme at sectoral and organisational level across the public service, as well as the continuation and development of the partnership process introduced under Partnership 2000. I believe that the programme will significantly enhance the responsiveness of the public service to the challenging demands which it faces, not least the successful implementation of the national development plan and the programme itself.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the concerns that have been expressed about the pay terms of the programme. Some have argued that the increases could threaten competitiveness. The social partnership process has produced an impressive range of benefits for the people of this country. That has been possible because of the compromises reached in successive agreements and because of the sacrifices which many people made in pursuit of the common good and the national interest.</P>
    <P>Now that the economy is performing strongly, has done so for the past few years and is projected to continue to do so, it would have been unfair and untenable to propose that the benefits of social partnership would involve little reward or sharing. Such an approach would not have yielded an agreement in the first place.</P>
    <P>The programme is predicated on achieving an annual average GNP growth rate of about 5.6% over the period 2000 to 2002, provided there are sustained improvements in productivity, that international competitiveness is maintained, that emerging supply side constraints are overcome and that significant budgetary surpluses are recorded in each year of the programme.</P>
    <P>Another concern that has been expressed is that inflation might erode the value of the pay increases and provide too little real reward for workers. Recent figures have been unsatisfactory. External factors, including oil price increases and the euro exchange rate with sterling, have impacted on inflation here. The entirely appropriate increase in duty on tobacco has also contributed. However, all reasonable observers are confident that the current inflation numbers will show significant reductions before the end of the current year and that the average inflation rate over the period 2000-2, inclusive, will be of the order of 2%-2.5%. The Minister for Finance will be taking such measures as are appropriate to ensure that low inflation is maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> When the taxation changes and pay increases operative over the period of this programme come into effect they will deliver substantial real increases in take home pay. For example, increases of the order of 10% or more in take home pay for the average worker in the current year will produce very substantial real increases. These increases and our overall prosperity require adherence to the pay terms of the new programme. The Government for its part has lived up to and will live up to its commitments. Equally, pay developments in the public service, the private sector and the commercial State companies must be consistent with the terms of Partnership 2000 and with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, if ratified.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland withdrew from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions during the recent national pay talks over the PCW &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo; issue and I note that according to press reports they have decided to submit a claim for a 30% increase in teachers' pay. This claim has not yet been submitted to the Teachers' Conciliation Council which is the forum at which such claims would be discussed. In the event of such a claim being submitted I wish to make it clear that the Government cannot contemplate any response to such a claim other than the application of the pay and other measures contained within the proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The programme provides for direct pay increases of 15% to teachers over the period of the agreement. In addition it has been agreed in the context of the acceptance of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to apply a 3% increase to the salaries of PCW &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo; with effect from 1 October 2000. As teachers are included in this group they will receive direct pay increases of 18% during the life of the programme. In addition teachers will benefit to a very significant extent from the taxation measures announced in the budget and proposed in the new programme.</P>
    <P>The combined effects of the announcement made by the Minister for Education and Science in December 1999 on additional teaching posts in schools and the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will provide 1,400 extra teaching posts in post-primary schools over the period of the programme. These additional posts will improve the working conditions of teachers generally.</P>
    <P>If there is one lesson to be learned from the way public service pay developed in recent years it is the impossibility of trying to single out any group as apparently unique and deserving of special treatment. The early settlers provision &ndash; which was, crucially, agreed with unions representing both early and late settlers &ndash; and the new benchmarking body are designed to restore stability to public service pay and provide a coherent way forward. The Government cannot, and will not, put this at risk by dealing with any <Col N="397" /> group outside the confines of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>As well as providing for major improvements in living standards for all, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a wide range of measures to enable us to compete successfully in a rapidly changing world. The programme recognises the significant competitiveness challenges facing Ireland arising from the information revolution, globalisation and EU enlargement. As a result of EMU membership, any loss of competitiveness could be punished severely.</P>
    <P>The programme addresses these challenges with a particular focus on promoting lifelong learning as a national priority; securing a leading position for Ireland in the global information society; investment in research and development, innovation and upskilling to enable enterprise to move up the value chain of economic activity and a continued focus on reforming our regulatory and competition systems as well as modernising the public service.</P>
    <P>The programme also contains a package of measures to develop the key sectors of the economy, including indigenous and foreign owned industry, small business and services, tourism, construction, energy, the food industry, forestry and the marine sector, as well as our agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will provide the best possible grounding for further economic and social progress in this country. The next step is for the organisations which agreed the programme to proceed with their different ratification procedures. In that regard, I particularly welcome the recommendations in favour of acceptance by the national executives of three of the country's largest trade unions &ndash; SIPTU, IMPACT and MSF. I look forward to a successful outcome and to working with the social partners in implementing the programme in the period ahead. I thank all the many people who worked so hard during the three month period to bring the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness into being.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt social partnership has brought Ireland many gains. Looking back over a decade, GDP has doubled and employment has increased by 500,000 &ndash; both phenomenal achievements. Undoubtedly the construction of political and social consensus around the key elements of an employment strategy was crucial to that achievement. It allowed us get the basic environment right and to establish sustainable competitive strengths that have underpinned our export-led growth. It also gave us the benefits to reap the opportunities provided by a dramatic demographic change in Ireland. Migration was reversed, female participation grew and our sustained investment in education finally began to pay off. Credible Government commitments to match pay moderation were an invaluable glue in making this policy a success. <Col N="398" /> The question now is not whether we can sustain that economic progress but whether we can use it to secure real improvements in the quality of life in Ireland. It is over three decades since John Kenneth Galbraith berated US policy for creating public squalor amidst private wealth but his words have a great resonance in Ireland today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are running our economic engine at red hot speed. The Minister for Finance is piling on the coal. Individualisation was seen as a clever way to squeeze another few knots out of the vessel. The ship is undoubtedly ploughing through the waters faster than any other, new car sales are humming, property values are soaring. However, in the eagerness to run headlong to the next marker, the Government has failed to notice how many people have fallen overboard and how savage is the undertow in the backwash for those who have lost their grip.</P>
      <P>There are in Ireland today huge numbers who are caught in the backwash. They get precious little mention in the Taoiseach's speech. There are 4,000 homeless adults in Dublin, including 1,250 teenagers and dependent children, 400 of whom sleep rough each night. They remain homeless for two years before getting accommodation. Housing lists are up 50% since the Taoiseach took office. Not one house has been built under the affordable housing scheme which the Government announced over a year ago and not one will be built in Dublin for another year. Hospital waiting lists are up 50%. In Dublin 1,100 nurses have been sucked out of the health system, robbing our most vulnerable people of two million man hours of care. Chaos regularly reigns in the casualty departments. The head of the casualty department, where the Taoiseach was employed for many years, had to go on the media to alert us to the scale of the crisis.</P>
      <P>Four years ago the national anti-poverty strategy set the target that serious literacy and numeracy problems would be eliminated in early primary education by 2002. It also set the target that early school leaving would be halved by 2000. What has happened? The literacy problem has escalated in our primary schools and early school leaving has not diminished. No progress has been made in either of these targets in deprived areas. Over 20% of pupils in the Taoiseach's constituency have serious literacy problems. To hear the sinner vowing to mend his ways must always be welcome but, having listened to the new Minister for Education and Science speak on literacy, we cannot suspend our critical faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government is to set out credible commitments for a new phase of partnership it must look at how the benchmarks of homelessness, literacy and hospital chaos square up to our leading economy status. These are not the failures of our economy, they are the failure of governance. Ministers cannot plead ignorance or a shortage of revenue for the persistence of these problems. <Col N="399" /> They are a consequence of a failure to put workable structures in place to address these issues as priorities.</P>
    <P>Fairness is in the title of the new partnership agreement. It contains many aspirations but has the Government the capacity to deliver them? In the place of well worked out strategic reforms the social partners are being asked to make an act of faith in the big spending plans of Government. This may be enough to ensure the signing of an agreement but the people do not want plans. They want delivery. All Deputies witness the despair of homeless people hoping in vain that we can magically secure something for them. There is no Deputy who does not see the weary exhaustion of carers, overwhelmed by the burden of caring, with no opportunity to complain and with no statutory rights. They face chronic shortages of respite places, have little care assistance and no evening or night time cover. They face the alarming uncertainty of what will happen when they are no longer there to care.</P>
    <P>I have searched in vain for time-bounded targets in this plan to resolve these easily identifiable needs of the casualties of our programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are absolutely not there. Homelessness is mentioned once but action is still one report away. I searched in vain for even a mention of hospital waiting lists, the chaos in casualty departments or the shortage of nurses. They do not warrant a single mention. The agreement sleepwalks through the health crisis. It is peppered with reviews, committees, consultative groups and forums but these are no substitute for action on these resolvable problems.</P>
      <P>There is little evidence that the new realities of being in the euro zone have, in any way, changed the traditional instruments in the pay settlements worked out in this agreement. We know we are out of kilter with the rest of Europe. We also know that we have no independent interest rate policy, no independent exchange rate policy and little or no control over credit volume. We need to think about flexibility in reward mechanisms that could respond to the changed circumstances that could suddenly come upon us. The agreement contains remarkably little discussion of gainsharing vehicles that would allow public and private sector payments to be made in good economic circumstances which might not be automatically payable should conditions change. Instead, only in the most extreme circumstances, is some form of renegotiation envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be forgotten that matters can change quite rapidly in an economy such as ours with fixed exchange and interest rates. The extraordinary strength of sterling in the past year could reverse. A switch in the relationships between supply and demand in the housing market could <Col N="400" /> significantly rock the boat. The growing evidence of overheating in our economy is inescapable. It is reflected in the rapid increases in property prices, unprecedented demand for credit, labour shortages, higher inflation in the services sector and chronic congestion in the physical infrastructure. When the chairman of the Central Bank drew attention to this, the Minister for Finance regarded him as a party pooper. Like the red queen in <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>his has only one answer, &ldquo;Off with their heads&rdquo;. This is not good enough. Prudence demands that agreements anticipate potential shoals in the waters as we approach.</P>
    <P>Many see the pay terms of this agreement as a starting point and a mere springboard to the real bargaining. The Garda &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo; gave the lead and bus workers and teachers have taken the cue. The Government has shown, time and again, that it will bend to pressure from strategic sources, whether in key services or political quarters. The pattern of U-turn is clear.</P>
    <P>The new system of developing comparisons with private sector employment through benchmarking is a cause of some concern. It is a welcome departure in many ways but the agreement provides that all the new special increases will be worked out over the next couple of years and will fall due to be paid at the end of the present agreement. This is surely loading up a big bill that will stand like a potential avalanche over the subsequent pay round, perhaps at a time when the absorption capacity of the economy is very different. It is not greed which drives these pressures. It is the collapse of people's hopes of owning a home of their own and the failure to put workable strategies in key areas for the public service. The Government seems incapable of resolving these pressures which have the capacity to derail our progress. The Government is seen to be losing its grip.</P>
    <P>The agreement's failure to address the issue of balancing family responsibilities with economic progress is one of its greatest disappointments. It has not proved itself capable of dealing with the issue of child care. The perverse Government thinking which undermined the budget has cast a long shadow over these discussions. In the budget, the Minister did not see the cost of child care as something to be relieved. He regards having children as a consumer good. He does not accept that people should be free to choose whether one of the spouses should stay at home to care for the family. Instead he traps them into making choices which bring them into the workplace. This is no way to tackle the complex issues of balancing family responsibilities with the demands of work. It shows that Government strategy was merely to pile coal onto the economic engine. It is a huge disappointment that this issue has not been properly and honestly addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Recently in my constituency, I carried out a survey of people's attitudes and the problems of child care. On average, in my constituency of Dublin North Central, child care costs £150 of gross income per week for one child. I asked people their view of the adequacy of the Government's support for child care. Only 1% of families responded that they believed the Government's approach to child care is adequate. People's patience is wearing thin. They have heard many promises in Government programmes before the Taoiseach took office and they now find that the question is not being addressed in the partnership agreement. There was a strong belief that the budget would address this issue. This issue will come back to haunt the Government. People's patience is wearing thin.</P>
    <P>Equally disappointing is the weakness of the provisions for family friendly policies. They are timid and disappointing and are set against the assumption that improving the efficiency of the business is a necessary condition for such policies. The approach is solely employer driven. The national initiative will only draw up a menu. There is no commitment to adopt any of the measures to make the workplace more family friendly. A committee is established but is confined to employers and unions. Surely the omission of parents and their representatives or of women's groups and their representatives was a great error.</P>
    <P>Partnership has served us well. In the recent budget the Government went out of its way to undermine some of the pillars of partnership. The NESC had set out key policy priorities. These were to increase the standard rate of personal allowance in the tax code and to increase child benefit which would be neutral in respect of child care choices and labour market position. In less than an hour on budget day, the Minister for Finance kicked over the traces of social partnership and flushed away many of the foundations of the consensus. The Government has had to restructure those and tax proposals which the Taoiseach described as rubbish when tabled by Fine Gael are now part and parcel of the partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>There is real doubt whether the Government has the capacity to sustain the benefits that social partnership has brought us. We are entering a new phase and there is no evidence that the new priorities loom large on the agenda of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Few people dispute that the system of social partnership which we have had since 1987 has played a significant part in our economic recovery and in the remarkable level of growth we have experienced in the past few years. During tough times the system provided a considerable degree of industrial peace and ensured at least that those at the bottom of the ladder did <Col N="402" /> not fall further behind, as would almost inevitably have been the case in an industrial relations free-for-all where those with the industrial muscle would have consumed most of the economic cake.</P>
      <P>The nature of these agreements has changed during the years. The first agreement in 1987 was basically a pay agreement. As each successive one was negotiated the scope expanded. The Partnership 2000 negotiations which I spearheaded as Minister for Finance included for the first time the community and voluntary sector. This new agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is the most comprehensive ever, running to 132 pages with sections dealing with almost every area of social and economic life ranging from racism to rural regeneration.</P>
      <P>Against a background of unprecedented prosperity it is not surprising that there should have been the most vigorous debate within the trade union movement as to whether there should be another agreement and whether the draft agreement merits support. It is a matter for the members of the trade union movement to make their decision through their internal democratic structures but given the importance of the agreement it is also important that the Dáil should have an opportunity to make its voice heard.</P>
      <P>Despite its 132 pages, at its core, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is a pay and tax agreement with a nod in the direction of social welfare and the community and voluntary sector. As Deputy Bruton said, many of the other sections are aspirational with much work to be done by the plethora of bodies and committees yet to be established. The Labour Party does not regard many of these sections as being in any way adequate or comprehensive but we will certainly act as a watchdog in regard to the commitments entered into by the Government and insist that all are honoured within the required time frame</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement most workers stand to benefit from the combined pay and tax commitments to the extent of around 25%. If the tax commitments are fully honoured and if the January inflation figures of 4% plus are not an indication of the future pattern it is hard to disagree with the conclusion of the general secretary of IMPACT, Mr. Peter McLoone, that the pay element of the agreement is probably the best that could have been negotiated with the Government and, to go further, that there is no other process that would deliver something similar.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the Finance Bill which shamelessly ignored the needs of those on low pay the combination of the political pressure exerted in this House and the demands of the trade unions and the Third Pillar extracted a number of concessions from the Government but given the extent of the resources available to it, these fall far short of what could and should have been done for those on social welfare and low pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> It is regrettable that to avoid further humiliation for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Government responded to pressure to do something for the low paid by taking additional workers out of the PRSI net. The Labour Party fundamentally disagrees with the principle of raiding the social insurance fund. Relief for the low paid could and should have come through further tax cuts. This was the preferred option of the trade union movement and many trade union leaders share the concerns I have just expressed about the implications for the social insurance fund of the scale of the measures contained in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness can only be read in conjunction with a number of other documents. Principal among them is the little read Stability Programme published by the Department of Finance on budget day. This is prepared by the Government for submission to the European Commission in accordance with our obligations and commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of economic and monetary union. It sets out the broad parameters of economic policy to be pursued by the Government, not just in the year ahead but over a three year period. In the programme the Government commits itself to reducing the share of national wealth, GDP, to be consumed by current public spending to 25%. This would make Ireland the lowest public spender in the OECD, even lower than the United States.</P>
    <P>What does this figure mean? It means the Government has no intention of creating a society which can be described as fair. It represents a formal and conscious rejection of the European social model in which the State intervenes not just to tackle inequality but to guarantee its citizens a certain level of health care, social protection, education and support at different stages of their lives. As things stand, income inequality here is among the highest in the OECD. The states where it is low are states in which the Government intervenes to ensure it is low. Sadly we are now among them. The Government, as the Taoiseach indicated at a Cairde Fáil dinner just before Christmas, is embracing a social model based on the low tax, low service model synonymous with the United States.</P>
    <P>My party profoundly rejects that view of society but Fianna Fáil is now in the grip of an ideological elite, some inside the party, others outside it, intent on propelling the party in that direction and sadly it is led by a Taoiseach who, although he should know better and perhaps believes otherwise, would rather the easy life than confront this cabal within the Government. The sad reality is that he cannot even get one of the leaders of that cabal to meet the credit unions.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who feared that the social partners might not agree to another national pro<Col N="404" /> gramme because the actions of the Government suggested that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats did not want one. For example, in two of his three budgets the Minister for Finance spurned the partnership economic consensus by targeting his tax reductions at the better off. The Minister may point to his mandate from the people to reduce the upper rate of tax and argue that his democratic mandate supersedes partnership agreements and he may be right but the question then is why proceed with partnership at all.</P>
    <P>The result is a muddled and incoherent strategy on tax. At the core of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is a commitment to take the minimum wage out of the tax net. It is an objective fully supported by the Labour Party and I congratulate the social partners on bringing the Government round on the issue. The question is whether the Government will honour it. It cannot begin to honour it, if it maintains the cabal's obsession with reducing the high rate of income tax. The Labour Party will be pushing hard to ensure the objective of taking the minimum wage out of the tax net is honoured. We will ride shotgun on this objective very strongly.</P>
    <P>My party does not believe, as my party colleague, Deputy McDowell, indicated on Tuesday night, that there remains unlimited scope for tax cuts. Prior to the agreement we reaffirmed our commitment to take out of the tax net, the minimum wage which we advocated should be £5 per hour. We also stated categorically that we would not be bound by the Minister's other commitments on taxation such as further reductions in the upper rate which, taken in conjunction with the core commitment of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will cost in excess of £2.5 billion in our calculations over the next two to three years.</P>
    <P>Our fear is that in different and perhaps more difficult economic circumstances, should inflationary fear not subside, for instance, the Minister will recoil from his commitments. We have witnessed the reaction of the Central Bank to this year's budget package. Unless the Minister begins in next year's budget to substantially increase the size of the tax credit, including setting aside his other commitments for a time, it may not happen at all. The social partners should be made well aware of this.</P>
    <P>We have contracted the entire tax base considerably in recent years and the Minister has done so more than any of his predecessors. I am not certain how much more there is to give. In effect, we have socialised the cost of businesses in recent years and it will soon be time for them to stand on their own two feet. The State has given the economy a considerable leg up in recent years &ndash; the proposed corporation tax rate of 12.5% is the prime case in point &ndash; but a leg up <Col N="405" /> for Irish businesses cannot become a permanent crutch.</P>
    <P>The social partners are aware for instance that my party is not committed to the Minister's individualisation proposals and certainly would not proceed with them were we to enter Government this year. They will also be aware that we would like to see a more expansive programme of house building than that outlined in the programme and we will rarely see eye to eye with the Government on its treatment of refugees.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many measures agreed in this programme will be subject to votes in this House over the next few years. They will not be proceeded with without democratic sanction and this has always been the case, but are people seriously suggesting we go back to an age when people were not consulted and the executive power was exercised ruthlessly and often without accountability? My party believes in consultation, discussion and agreement, where necessary, with stakeholders in society. That is why my party, in Government, brought the community and voluntary pillar into the talks on Partnership 2000. Social partnership is not the only model which fulfils this criteria, and it should not be set in stone.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that some Members of the House should be concerned at what they see as the marginalisation of the Dáil in this process, but the least we should do is ensure that our own often archaic rules and procedures do not contribute to this perception of marginalisation. Certainly it is absolutely ludicrous that the listing of these short statements on the PPF on the schedule of business should have resulted in a series of parliamentary questions to Ministers on various aspects of the agreement being ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a debate about the future of social partnership over the course of this agreement, if it is adopted. The process has its flaws but these should not be allowed to overcome its strengths. Like everything else, people can tire of a process that has lasted for some time. That is as true of social partnership as of anything else, but whatever else succeeds it, wage increases that feed inflation which give rise to further increases are in nobody's interests. Competitiveness is not a neo-liberal conspiracy; it is in all our interests, especially those of the 10% we have taken out of unemployment and enabled get back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The conditions of crisis and poverty which gave rise to the beginnings of social partnership are no longer with us. The search for a new sense of national purpose is not yet under way &ndash; sadly new found prosperity seems to have suffocated political debate &ndash; but I am confident it will emerge. My party's vision of a fair society is totally at odds with that of the Government. For example, we can now afford to put in place the best health care system in Europe for all citizens. <Col N="406" /> The question is: does the Government really want to do so? The question which really hangs in this Chamber this afternoon is: what do they want to do with our new found wealth, other than merely reduce taxes for the well-off?</P>
    <P>There are a number of substantial measures before the House this week: the Finance Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and these statements. Sadly, they all reveal a Government without any strategic approach to economic management. The tax strategy in this year's Finance Bill and that championed in the programme, for example, are fundamentally at odds. There is a clear contradiction in both the direction and the philosophy underpinning them.</P>
    <P>My party has always supported the social partnership process and we continue to do so. Partnership has been at the centre of recent economic growth. It set out parameters within which policy was determined. That the section on taxation is sufficiently broad to allow the Minister proceed on a number of fronts gives the lie to the argument that social partnership and democratic government are mutually exclusive. On countless occasions over the next three years, measures agreed and not agreed in this programme will be made subject to decisions in this House. If we as an Opposition or even backbenchers do not get an opportunity to contribute to the consideration of these decisions, it is as much the fault of procedures of this House as it is of the social partners. It is important that this point is not exaggerated. Deputy McCreevy broke with the partnership in two out of three budgets, and with the support of the House, including the so-called four Independents, he was free to do so. The Labour Party will examine his behaviour closely to see that it conforms with the key commitments in this programme, which most commentators believe will go some way to ensuring the economy has a soft landing, not because we are bound by an agreement made over our heads but because the word of the Government, given voluntarily to the social partners, should be kept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that there are other aspects of this which were addressed recently on the Finance Bill and earlier today on the Social Welfare Bill. Recently the House debated the national development plan also. All of those, taken in context with the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, must be seen as a strategic policy-driven approach to economic and social development for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the model of social partnership which has been fashioned by the Taoiseach and which has been developed by people like Deputy Quinn and Deputy Bruton. If they are given the opportunity of second guessing what is in the plan and the approach, which I hope will not be the case <Col N="407" /> in the near future, I hope they will continue to support it.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the continuing elitism of the recent discussions, particularly when one finds oneself, as a Member of the House, in the invidious position of approaching people in the voluntary and community pillar suggesting that there are ideas which ought to be incorporated into a plan or the approach, when people in this House ought to be taking the lead in that area. However, I do not wish to cavil too much with that because I am pleased with the model which has evolved and the strategy which has been devised. It will serve the country well.</P>
    <P>I spoke on other issues earlier and I want to focus on a couple of ones which are reasonably close to my heart and to those of us who are based in the Dublin area. Transport is an area which has been rightly highlighted in this plan. No doubt there is a need to improve infrastructure. There are bottlenecks evident here. Many of us would think that quality of life measures ought not to be the only criterion to improve transport facilities, but they are an important aspect of it. There is planned, here and through the national development plan, the largest ever investment programme in the national transport system. It aims to provide a well-functioning integrated transport system to reduce travel times to work in places like Dublin, etc. The development of QBCs and the investment in the rail system will significantly enhance people's quality of life.</P>
    <P>A new faster approach to the building of national roads and new motorways has been discussed here on several occasions. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which is making its way through the House, will facilitate that. Many of us in the Dublin area wait with bated breath to see will the port tunnel begin. I am a little concerned that it seems it is being stalled yet again, even at the stage where trial bores are being made in the Marino area. It is important that we get on with the tunnel as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I think we will get composting instead. We will have to deal with that and other issues like it. The model of public private partnerships should be developed and worked on more energetically than at present. A model along the lines of the West Link toll bridge would be welcome.</P>
      <P>Housing has been a source of great concern to those of us on the city council. We are all very aware of the difficulties at present despite the record number of houses being built in the city. We have concerns about the time it is taking to refurbish flats, particularly inner city flats. The quality of people's lives, however, will be improved dramatically. I spoke to one of my colleagues last night who said that there are 30 flat complexes in one of the wards in the Dublin South Central constituency which need to be radically and immediately overhauled. That is a significant social inclusion measure. We talk about social mixing and intervention in the area of education and lifelong learning, all of which are mentioned in this programme which has been agreed with the partners.</P>

      <P>The strategic policy committee on housing, which was set up, met only this week in Dublin Corporation and is bringing together many of the partners whom we would expect to participate in such a forum. I was particularly glad that all parties agreed, without any great difficulty, that the voluntary housing sector would have significant representation on it. I look forward to it as a model to develop policy in that sphere. Sometimes I think the issue of homelessness is being tackled somewhat tentatively. We need to address it.</P>
      <P>Many people who might heretofore have shunned local authority housing on grounds of less than adequate estate management are now moving in the direction of supporting voluntary housing association complexes. NABCO developments, for example, are very eagerly sought after as a good half way measure between local authority living and tenant purchase living. I am glad to see it is there. The issue of the private rented sector is being tackled by the Government. A review is being done which will bring forward findings, but the issue of security of tenure is critical and needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On child care and family friendly policies, I am glad there is an objective in the agreement to promote further child care places in the public and private sectors. We have seen particularly good models. Forgive me for being parochial but in my constituency in Ballymun, we have the Tír na nÓg development which is superb. Deputy Short<Col N="409" /> all, my colleague from the Dublin North-West constituency, has been instrumental in that development. Colaiste Éanna in Cabra, through the VEC and the local area based partnership, has developed a very good model. I was in DCU the other morning and, again through imaginative use of funding, it has developed child care places and cre±che facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is imperative that the issue of price disparity which exists in home insurance premia is addressed. As it stands, the consumer is being doubly ripped off. On the one hand, potential homeowners are being forced to pay exorbitant prices for homes and, despite what the Government says, there appears to be no stabilisation in house prices. Eventually when those lucky enough to purchase a home are given their keys, they encounter the second rip off when they seek insurance cover for their home.</P>
      <P>It is often said that one of the most stressful times of one's life is the ordeal of purchasing a house. Going to the bank manager to secure a mortgage, finding enough money to place a deposit and attending solicitors to sort out the house purchase, as well as paying the solicitors for their service, are some of the stresses of home purchasing. After the exhaustive process of purchasing, the matter of insurance cover is generally dealt with through the mortgage lending agency. The consumer seldom asks questions and accepts the insurance package put before them.</P>
      <P>However, a new survey which has yet to be published but which has been seen by the<i> Irish Independent</i> may make the consumer think twice. In a survey commissioned by the Automobile Association and carried out by the consultants Covanberg, great price disparities were highlighted in the home insurance market. So glaring was this disparity that the consumer could end up paying an extra £3,280 in insurance costs during the lifetime of their 25 year mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that mortgage lending agencies effectively have a monopoly over the home insurance market. After purchasing a home, the consumer may feel morally or legal obliged to accept insurance cover with their lending agency. They fail to shop around and may end up getting the most expensive, but least comprehensive, deal on the market. While I accept that consumer inertia has partly contributed to this cosy monopoly <Col N="410" /> for lending agencies, a lack of awareness about the right of the consumer to shop around is also a factor.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the AA survey was the fact that some insurance policies are out dated and fail to recognise rising building costs associated with the booming housing market. It appears that some insurance providers have failed to increase insurance sufficiently to cover the cost of rebuilding a house in the event of fire, for example. Many policy holders are covered for house rebuilding costs which are now seriously outdated. Building costs have soared in recent years due to the demands in the construction industry. The construction industry can now name a price and the consumer must take it or leave it. It is, therefore, vital that all insurance providers give realistic cover to consumers which would genuinely cover the cost of rebuilding in the event of a fire. Equally, consumers should examine their insurance policy to ascertain whether it is comprehensive enough to meet current market cost of rebuilding.</P>
    <P>Home insurance will always remain a necessity in modern life but that necessity should not be exploited by those providers who have a head start in the market because of their involvement in mortgage provision. It is essential that consumers are made aware of the choices they have in the market, that the insurance they are sold is comprehensive and that the massive disparities which exist do not continue. I hope the Minister will undertake to investigate the home insurance market. As I said at the outset, the consumers are the big losers in our housing boom and they do not deserve to be ripped off on the double.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably concerned about rating differences on the basis of area. I am sure that she would agree that differences in the price of insurance charged by different companies &ndash; a sign of a competitive market &ndash; are to be welcomed, especially from the point of the consumer. Indeed, we are fortunate that up to now we have had a competitive market for insurance.</P>
      <P>While some forms of insurance are expensive by European standards, notably motor and employers' liability, we have established that this is due to the relatively high personal injury compensation awards made here and the higher delivery costs of compensation, rather than lack of competition. Unlike motor and liability insurance, house contents insurance is generally cheaper in Ireland than in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent mergers in Britain and Europe will have the effect, at least in the short-term, of reducing the number of players in the Irish market. We will need to look further afield for new competitors in the Irish market. However, as the single market becomes more of a reality, we <Col N="411" /> should see more European companies becoming active in the Irish market. The final transition to the euro should make Europe, including Ireland, more attractive to US insurers thus increasing potential competition in the market.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister for Finance to reduce corporation tax significantly over the last few years and, more particularly, to agree with Europe that from 2003 it will be at the standard rate of 12.5%. That will level the playing field and create a major incentive for all companies, indigenous and international, to be able to deliver options to consumers. That is not to mention the potential of the Internet. To foster competition from these sources, I will be conscious of the need to maintain a good balance in regulation so as not to put in place any unnecessary barriers to entry to the Irish market.</P>
    <P>House insurance falls into parts. One part, buildings insurance, covers the cost of rebuilding the house in the event of, for example, a fire. I am informed that the risk rating for this type of insurance does not vary greatly, but the cost of rebuilding does vary. I understand the building costs in Dublin are higher than in Cork or Galway. Recent publicity has clarified that cost of rebuilding and not the market value of the house is what should be insured.</P>
    <P>The most important rating factor in respect of contents insurance is the risk of theft. Experience shows that houses in some areas are at greater risk than houses in other areas and premiums will vary accordingly. Insurance companies also take into account related factors in determining the level of premium. The most common example is whether the property is occupied during the day. On the positive side, policyholders who have a burglar alarm, and especially one connected to a central monitoring system, will benefit from discounts. Some insurance companies may provide discounts for householders involved in neighbourhood watch schemes. If householders believe they are paying excessive premiums, they should shop around and seek quotes from a number of insurers bearing in mind that there is genuine competition in the market.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, my primary statutory duty in relation to insurance is to protect the policyholder by enforcing solvency requirements so that insurers are always in a position to pay claims. Broadly, this requires that insurers price insurance so that it covers claims experience. Differentiating theft risk by area is a long standing practice. We accept that the risk of theft and, therefore, the price of contents insurance will be higher in Dublin than in a rural area. While I accept fully that there is always room for debate about how detailed insurance underwriting should become &ndash; after all, insurance is about the pooling of all risks &ndash; I am not convinced that we <Col N="412" /> need to inquire into long standing practices in risk rating in the case of contents insurance.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that, under EU law, our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as the supervisory authority, is not in a position to intervene with companies operating in the Irish market in relation to policy terms or pricing of insurance. Such a provision is necessary to permit the functioning of the Single Market in insurance on the basis that an insurer authorised in one member state may market its products in any member state. Under an EU directive they have freedom to establish and to provide services and we cannot interfere with that. I trust this information puts this issue in context for the Deputy and other Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecelia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Chair has given me the opportunity to speak on this most important issue. As most people will realise, Donegal has borne the brunt of devastating job losses during the past 18 months due in part to the demise of the textile industry as we know it. Having put all the eggs into one basket, so to speak, there has been a torrent of closures and general uncertainty. In rounded statistics, there have been approximately 1,600 redundancies in the county, 1,200 of which happened in my area. That has implications not only for the workers and their close knit families, to which I again extend my sincere sympathy, but it has a ripple effect on the economy of the county for businesses unconnected to the core problem.</P>
      <P>While I thank the Tánaiste for setting up the Donegal task force initiative and congratulate the county manager, Michael McLoone and his team on the excellent report they compiled, the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate. The Tánaiste's recent visit and her positive reaction to the putting in place of an implementation group to help deliver the aims and objectives of the report was welcome news, but it coincided with yet another factory closure.</P>
      <P>Inishowen has three relatively small but expanding towns &ndash; Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville. Each of those towns in turn has been laid low by layoffs in Fruit of the Loom, the Dromont factory, Jay Bees and Fingal. Outside the major towns there have also been lay offs and closures in Malin Head, Newtowncunningham and Fahan. Inishowen is a peninsular unit and when one portion is hit the entire area is hit as workers are bussed from many rural areas to the location of the employment. Unfortunately, in this instance the knocks we have taken have been balanced &ndash; every section of the peninsula got a severe setback and there is not much left to lose, as we look to the remaining Fruit of the Loom jobs, some fishing and some farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> Dealing with the textile industry would necessitate, in the first instance, the holding of a seminar within the county comprising all interested parties. We have people who have been made redundant but who are skilled. There is an abundance of work in Dublin but no workers. People are interested in setting up co-operatives but only at the start of a process. Experienced people are beginning smaller enterprises after larger ones have closed. We could work on niche markets. Companies are struggling on and hoping for what I would call divine intervention to keep them afloat and others are doing well. Surely in this mixed bag there are opportunities for pooling knowledge and taking an objective look at the overall picture.</P>
    <P>The concept of decentralising Government offices or State agencies to Inishowen should be seriously considered. While I accept that would not solve all our problems in terms of job creation, it would be a boost, which could assist in maintaining the beautiful area in which we live, its shops, schools, public services and so forth. In this day and age emigration to America should no longer be considered an option by our young people. The people of the Inishowen peninsula are firmly of the belief that they have a lot to offer, given half a chance. That has been proven recently by the announcement that the Forward Emphasis Company based in Belfast will open a branch in Malin Head. Without being disingenuous to those who live in Malin Head, I would say it was generally felt that of all places in Ireland to which an industry would be attracted, it would not be to the empty Fruit of the Loom plant in Malin and yet, the Forward Emphasis group has been vociferous in extolling the virtues of the people and the location in terms of the many advantages they consider the area offers.</P>
    <P>The task force report outlined in a frank and straightforward manner the issues that we want addressed, be it rail or air access for which there are proposals on the table, road or water/ sewerage infrastructure. Donegal County Council wants these aspects advanced. The Government also wants them advanced and, to this end, there is a commitment in the national development plan. I ask the Minister for Finance to expedite those proposals.</P>
    <P>The report recommended a substanial increase in the level of job creation and employment initiatives from State agencies and all in a position to assist. I acknowledge the Tánaiste fully supports these recommendations. We can sell the advantages of the quality of life, the healthy environment, the relatively low cost of living, the easy access to all levels of education and the proximity to large thriving towns, ports or airports &ndash; the list is endless. However, at present we are not receiving the immediate injection we need. That rests with the Government in terms of <Col N="414" /> its implementation of the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>While external forces come into play when one talks about foreign investment, and we will continue to fight for this through the agencies, national support and recognition rely on decisions being taken here to put into concrete fashion what to date have been nice words and platitudes. In terms of those decisions that are in the hands of the Government and State agencies, I call for the Minister's commitment to recognise and assist us. Let prosperity and confidence break out in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Budget Statement I announced the Government's intention to embark on a new and radical programme of decentralisation with the relocation of the maximum number of public service jobs from Dublin. It is intended that almost entire Departments of State and other public bodies will be transferred to provincial centres and, for the first time, the programme will involve the non-commercial semi-State sector. This endorses the earlier statement in the reviewed Action Programme for the Millennium, in which the Government reiterated its commitment to a policy of balanced regional development and set as a key priority the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas.</P>
      <P>While some Government services necessarily have a regional structure, that is, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the extended decentralisation programme was announced only in 1981. Since then, 4,000 civil servants have been relocated. When the current programme is completed, in about 18 months' time, 14,000 civil servants will be located outside of Dublin. This represents about 47% of the entire Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The current programme has seen civil servants relocated to 20 provincial centres in 19 counties, including Donegal. These locations were selected by the Government having regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and a more even spread of public service jobs around the country. The Government is satisfied that the positive effects of decentralisation, including the economic benefits to host locations, a better use of existing infrastructure and the reduction of congestion in Dublin, outweigh any negative effects such as additional administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In progressing the recently announced programme, I intend to bring proposals before my Government colleagues with whom I will decide which areas are to be decentralised and the provincial centres to which they will be relocated. Thereafter, logistical arrangements such as staff training and the provision of suitable accommodation will be addressed. Neither have decisions yet <Col N="415" /> been taken in relation to the areas of work to be relocated or the centres to which they are to be transferred, nor will they be taken until the issue has been considered by the Government. I intend to request all Ministers to examine their Departments and the offices under their aegis with a view to identifying almost complete Departments and other public bodies for relocation. As regards the centres to which such offices will be relocated, the Government is anxious that decentralisation will continue to contribute to the promotion of regional development and the greater geographical spread of Government services. In that regard, no town or city is being ruled out.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am well aware of the many cases made to me to include particular locations in the forthcoming programme and I wish to assure the proponents of those centres that all will be considered fully when determining the centres for inclusion in the new programme.</P>
    <P>For the first time it is intended to include non-commercial State-sponsored bodies in a programme of decentralisation. Ministers will be requested to consider the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies under their aegis for inclusion. I am not convinced that it is necessary for as many of the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies to be located in Dublin as is currently the case. While the programme does not extend to commercial State-sponsored bodies, I would welcome a decision on any of their parts to consider decentralisation on commercial grounds. I intend to bring initial proposals before my Government colleagues shortly with a view to having decisions taken by the middle of this year as to which Departments or offices are to be included in the new programme and the centres to which they are to be relocated. Thereafter, the Office of Public Works will be charged with the acquisition of suitable sites. With planning requirements, tendering and construction, it is estimated that it will be a further two to three years before staff will begin to relocate from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Keaveney that I have taken note of what she said about the unemployment problems in County Donegal. I am very aware of what happened there in the very recent past and of the high unemployment levels there before the recent job losses. The Deputy's contribution did not focus narrowly on decentralisation but ranged over a broader remit. I welcome her contribution in that regard. I agree with her that decentralisation will not solve unemployment but would give the county a boost. I will bear that in mind when decisions are being taken.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter because it highlights the huge difficulties caused to families by the unacceptable waiting time for children to have essential cardiac surgery.</P>
      <P>Last night's <i>Evening Herald</i> highlighted the story of baby Craig Gibbons and his mother and father. Baby Craig is 15 months old. He is one of 96 children awaiting heart surgery in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. The main artery in his heart has a blockage and is closing slowly. While Craig waits for essential cardiac surgery, he is dependent on antibiotics to keep him alive and well, and on regular attendance by his local general practitioner.</P>
      <P>The Gibbons family are fortunate in that the father works, and works extremely hard, and as a consequence they do not qualify for a medical card on financial eligibility grounds. No child should have to wait 15 months for such surgery. It is a scandal. It highlights the gross failure of this Government to ensure that children get the essential medical care to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Craig's parents are rightly concerned, and they want the surgery carried out as soon as possible. Their worries are exacerbated by the fact that the delay in the surgery is putting huge emotional and financial pressure on the family. The cost of medicines and GP attendance is such that the burden has become unacceptable. The <i>Evening Herald</i> reported last night &ndash; and it has been confirmed by my colleague, Deputy Tom Enright, who knows the family &ndash; that this family sought to have a medical card made available to it by the Midland Health Board and were refused. The health board has said that as the family does not fall within the financial eligibility, the child cannot have a medical card.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to the father &ndash; and this is outrageous &ndash; that he should render himself unemployed and the health board would then make a medical card available to him. An official of the health board said that there is no provision under the medical card scheme to grant a medical card generally on the basis of disability or illness except where specifically directed by the Minister for Health and Children. That is incorrect because, in such circumstances, a health board has discretion to issue a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister, first, to ensure that this child rapidly has the surgery to which he is entitled and, second, to make contact with the health board to query why it does not understand the workings of the medical card regulations and legislation. He should find out why it is not exercising the discretion that must be exercised in this case, which is to make available a medical card to this family for the benefit of this baby, in order that the father can stay in employment and the family can cease to be under the degree of <Col N="417" /> financial pressure they currently face as a consequence of the inability of the health service to provide essential cardiac surgery within a reasonable time when it is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a special appeal to the Minister for Health and Children to grant a personal medical card to Craig Gibbons, who is aged 15 months. Craig is on a waiting list at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin for an operation for a hole in his heart. His life is in danger as the hole in question is a medium to large one. He was diagnosed with this ailment on the day of his birth. The main artery to his heart is closing, resulting in the blockage cutting off the supply of oxygen to his body. His health is such that he turns blue on occasions and is unable to breathe. This is alarming for the boy and for his parents. He is on constant medication and has to travel from his home in Crettyard in Laois to Crumlin hospital, where he is very well looked after when he attends on a regular basis. His immune system is weak and he constantly catches colds. His health situation is so serious that if he does not have the operation by June, he will have to go to the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London for it, at additional cost.</P>
      <P>His mother, Anita, had to give up work to care for him. When the family applied to the Midland Health Board they were refused a medical card. I contacted the health board and was told he was refused on financial and medical grounds, which I find hard to believe, because full medical evidence was submitted, along with the application form. The facts I have stated here are exactly as outlined in the medical report which was sent to the health board. The child is not covered by the VHI and his father has to pay all the additional doctors', surgeons' and chemists' bills. I am amazed and disappointed that the Midland Health Board has refused a medical card in this instance.</P>
      <P>Let it be clearly understood that Mr. Gibbons and his wife want a medical card for their son only. They do not want it for anybody else in the family. I make two appeals to the Minister, first, to do everything in his power to expedite the operation for Craig and, second, to direct the health board to immediately grant a medical card to Craig Gibbons. Guidelines are only guidelines. In a very sensitive case of this nature where a boy's life is at risk, common sense, discretion and humanity must play their part in arriving at decisions. Such hard-line decisions as evidenced here must stop. The Minister should talk to the health boards to ensure that such a situation never arises again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance a medical card must and should be granted to Craig. There are at present 96 children who have been waiting for up to two years for vital cardiac operations in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. At a time when we are experi<Col N="418" /> encing an economic boom, this is not acceptable. I ask the Minister to provide additional nurses and a consultant paediatric cardiac surgeon, and to complete work on the two operating theatres at Our Lady's Hospital Sick Children, Crumlin. I believe the Minister will make sure a medical card will be granted in this case, and I thank him in anticipation of it. I also thank the local general practitioner, Dr. Jonathan Jacob, and the surgeons, nurses and other staff at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin who have been so kind to Craig. However, it is an outrage that this sort of situation should arise in this day and age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this issue. The reduction of waiting times for children requiring cardiac surgery at 0ur Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, which is the national paediatric cardiac centre, is a priority of mine and of my Department. In 1997, during discussions with the authorities of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and officials from my Department, we were informed that the reasons for the increased pressure on the hospital's cardiac services were due in the main to the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, a shortage of trained ICU nurses and advances in the surgical and intervention techniques available.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the hospital was allocated a sum of £500,000 from the cardiac waiting list initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in this area in the most effective and appropriate manner. The hospital used this funding to provide additional ICU beds, to implement a training programme for ICU nurses and to purchase a number of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>In 1998 and 1999, under the same initiative, the hospital received further funding of £878,550 and £340,000 respectively, which enabled the hospital to maintain its training programme and to continue to purchase cardiac procedures from the United Kingdom. As of 31 December 1999, 135 children had cardiac surgery funded by this initiative. My Department has already allocated £700,000 to allow the hospital to continue with this initiative in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is both my Department's and the hospital's position that the purchase of cardiac procedures from the UK is an interim measure, and that the best way to significantly enhance paediatric cardiac surgery is to increase Our Lady's Hospital's surgical capacity. In this regard officials in my Department are working in conjunction with the authorities on a major theatre development for Our Lady's Hospital. It is envisaged that when completed, the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres, complete with ancillary accommodation, <Col N="419" /> a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department.</P>
    <P>The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be able to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures a year, which is a 40% increase on its existing capacity. It is expected that this development will be completed in 2002.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. That is a statutory obligation and responsibility. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. The determination of eligibility rests with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and I understand the board has carefully considered this request.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day does not have a function in issuing medical cards to individuals. I have made inquiries with the health board concerned and I can confirm what Deputy Enright has said &ndash; that they are identifying the financial issues, as a factor in not issuing a medical card.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. So, the wherewithal exists for a health board to grant a medical card in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the child in question was placed on the waiting list for cardiac surgery in Our Lady's Hospital on 11 October 1999 &ndash; that is the date that I have been advised of &ndash; and was reviewed again on 7 January 2000. While the hospital is unable at this point to give a definite date for surgery, it expects that it will be carried out within the foreseeable future. However, it is important to note that the possession of a medical card would not affect the child's position on the waiting list, which is decided on grounds of clinical urgency. It is something which the clinicians decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> People who do not hold a medical card are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment, subject only to modest statutory charges, and out-patient services free of charge. There are also a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his or her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
    <P>As regards the general issue of cardiac waiting lists for children I am confident that as we have approved additional human resources &ndash; which will be in place by July 2002 &ndash; and when we have increased the surgical capacity, under the general medical scheme we will be able it improve waiting time significantly, as I have outlined. I intend to make further inquiries of the health board concerned in relation to the issues the Deputies have legitimately raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor made a number of decisions about remedial teachers across the country. He informed all principals that every school would have a remedial teacher. It so happened that by spreading the availability of teachers to schools it meant there was a reduction in the availability of such teachers for children who required remedial teaching, and Beaufort College in Navan, is not any different. It is a second level school run in conjunction with the VEC in Navan, and has just under 600 pupils. I am informed by the secretary of the parents' council at the college that the decision by the former Minister has led to a reduction in the availability of teaching hours for children who require remedial teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is wrong and it is an exercise by Government in playing around with figures at the expense of school children, not only at Beaufort College but also in other schools around the country. There are now insufficient hours available for remedial teaching in schools such as <Col N="421" /> Beaufort College. How does the Minister intend to rectify this problem?</P>
    <P>A few months ago I had the opportunity of raising this issue in the House in relation to primary school remedial teachers. Some of those remedial teachers had been covering four schools but their services were then extended so that they were covering six schools in part of the northern end of County Meath. Teachers are now spending half the time in their cars travelling from one school to another at the expense of children they are supposed to be teaching.</P>
    <P>A radical change of policy is needed by the Department. The Minister should take the initiative and rectify the problem. In his reply, I would like to hear the Minister stating that his priority is to ensure that every child needing remedial teaching &ndash; and not just in Navan &ndash; will be able to spend more time with such teachers rather than less. The result of the previous Minister's decision to provide remedial teaching all over the country was to take such teaching away from children who already had it. There is no point in pretending to parents of schoolchildren that there is a remedial teaching service in every school while in essence only a marginal service is available in schools such as Beaufort College in Navan. I ask the Minister to deal with this as a new initiative in his new brief. I ask him to solve this problem by providing extra teachers and to ensuring that pupils who require a remedial teaching service will have longer hours of remedial teaching. This is the least we can do to with the funds that are available due to the Celtic tiger. We should ensure that children have a proper remedial teaching service. Reports on the numbers of children leaving school without a proper education indicate that the lack of remedial teaching is a contributory factor. I ask the Minister to make this a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has raised this matter as it affords me the opportunity to advise the House of the position with regard to the provisions remedial teaching in primary and second level schools.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. Fully qualified primary teachers are trained to cope with a variety of reading problems, including those that are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The class teacher is ideally placed to provide the first line of assistance and support to pupils with special needs. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would therefore be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achieving in <Col N="422" /> primary schools. Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties, such as literacy and/or numeracy problems, by directly teaching individuals or small groups on a withdrawal basis.</P>
    <P>Where individual pupils are concerned, it is important that the educational response takes a variety of forms and should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual pupil. Many children with less serious difficulties are fully capable of having their needs met in ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis, with the help where necessary of a remedial teacher. In other cases the support of a special resource teacher may be a more appropriate response. Alternatively, where a child's needs are more serious, the most appropriate solution may involve placement in a special class attached to an ordinary school or placement in a special school dedicated to particular disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major expansion of the remedial teaching service in first and second level schools came into effect at the commencement of the current school year. The priority was to ensure that all schools without a service would have access to one with effect from September 1999. The position at second level is that, since the beginning of the current school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to a teacher allocation on an ex-quota basis in respect of remedial teaching. The allocation to individual schools for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post while schools with enrolments under 600 are allocated half a post in respect of remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the specific school referred to by the Deputy is that this school is one of the schools within the County Meath Vocational Education Committee. In the vocational sector teacher allocation is generally done on a VEC scheme basis rather than on an individual school basis. It is a matter for the chief executive officer with the agreement of the committee to allocate teaching resources to the individual schools in the scheme from within the overall approved allocation for the scheme. In the case of the County Meath VEC the teacher allocation for the current school year includes an ex-quota allocation of six wholetime teacher equivalents in respect of remedial teaching. This is an increase of two wholetime teacher equivalents over that allocated in respect of remedial teaching in the previous school year.</P>
    <P>As already stated, it is a matter for the chief executive officer to allocate resources to individual schools. I understand that in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy the remedial allocation for the current school year was based <Col N="423" /> on the entitlement as determined by the enrolment. Regarding the next school year, it will be a matter for the chief executive officer, with the agreement of the VEC, to decide on the allocation to be made having regard to the overall teacher allocation for the scheme. In the current school year, the total ex-quota allocation to second level schools in respect of remedial teaching is of the order of 560 wholetime teacher equivalents, which represents an increase of the <Col N="424" /> order of 210 wholetime teacher equivalents as compared to the previous year.</P>
    <P>The details I have outlined clearly demonstrate that significant expansion has taken place in the provision for remedial teaching in schools since this Government came into office. I assure the Deputy that the question of further improving the provision will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 February 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 52 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The claim that only 16% of cancer patients here receive radiotherapy is misleading and is based on a mis-interpretation of the available data. This figure from national cancer registry data represents the percentage of patients who have a regime of radiotherapy planned at initial diagnosis stage. It does not include the radiation given subsequently. These episodes of radiation are not at all reflected in the 16% reported by the national cancer registry.</P>
      <P>International figures quoted from a number of countries for total radiation given range from 33% in Sweden to 45% in Great Britain and 57% in the United States of America. Accurate figures for the total life time radiation for Irish patients are not available, but my advice is that they would be estimated at between 40% to 50%, indicating that Irish access to radiotherapy is not out of line with international norms.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify for the Deputies the considerable progress this Government is making in the development of radiotherapy services in the context of an agreed strategy based on a firm assessment of need.</P>
      <P>Major advances have taken place in the development of cancer treatment services since 1997, when a major action plan for the implementation of the national cancer strategy was announced. The two principal objectives identified by the strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel including for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy ser<Col N="427" /> vices should be provided from two supra regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's hospital, Dublin and Cork university hospital.</P>
    <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that this Government acted quickly in assessing that case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of some £10 million. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. This is currently out to tender with a view to construction work commencing in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I recently announced an important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork university hospital, with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospital opened in June 1998, having undergone a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of more than £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the need for further investment in cancer services and will continue to identify this as a priority for my tenure of office. The national cancer strategy has to date achieved a widespread enhancement of the range and quality of cancer services available and a major improvement in equity of access to these services. We must continue to look ahead however, and to examine ways of building on the success to date by continual improvement and investment. In this regard, I have received a proposal from the National Cancer Forum to establish an expert review group to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services in this country. It is my intention to act on this proposal and to quickly put arrangements in place for the establishment of such an expert group.</P>
    <P>While it must be recognised that significant progress has been made in the development of our infrastructure and services for the treatment and prevention of cancer, I am equally aware of the need for continued concerted effort in this area. It is my intention to continue to work with the National Cancer Forum to ensure that those <Col N="428" /> people requiring cancer treatment services will have available to them a high quality, equitable service that matches the best available anywhere in the world.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 124 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>A programme for the development of renal dialysis services was initiated by my predecessor as Minister for Health and Children with of an allocation of £3 million revenue funding and £3 million capital funding this year. This programme, which is to be completed over three years at an estimated total cost of £20 million, will be aimed at achieving a structured enhancement of the capacity of the system to meet existing and anticipated growth in demand for renal services over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The need for an initiative of this nature was based on the rapid rate of growth in demand for renal services, fuelled by demographic and epidemiological factors and reflecting a potential previous under-diagnosis of the disease in this country. My Department's analysis of the pressures on the system which informed the current initiative included an assessment of the capacity of the existing infrastructure to meet current and projected future demand. This analysis found that while there was available spare capacity at present to meet the haemo-dialysis needs of the population as a whole, there were particular pressures in a number of centres and an overall need for investment in infrastructure to ensure that future projected demand growth could continue to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> Under the major initiative now under way, it is intended to address existing infrastructural constraints that are limiting the ability of certain haemodialysis centres to meet demands for access to their services; ensure that regional dialysis centres are adequately resourced to give patients access to services close to their own home; provide for the availability of a consultant nephrology service in all regions with a view to widening the availability of alternative dialysis treatment programmes, such as CAPD and CCPD, for optimal and equitable individual patient choice; address wider health and social needs of the renal population through supporting the Irish Kidney Association in their development of targeted programmes in these areas.</P>
    <P>In identifying needs and prioritising developments, my Department's approach has been informed by its consultations to date with the relevant interests, including professionals in the field, the Irish Kidney Association as the principal patient advocates and other service providers and managers. It is intended to maintain and strengthen this consultative process in taking decisions on the further development of services and in providing for effective evaluation of the outcomes of measures being implemented.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned there was no misunderstanding on what information was being sought from the company in relation to constituents used in their tobacco products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gallahers submitted to my Department on 4 February the information on constituents in their <Col N="430" /> tobacco products in the format originally sought from the company.</P>

      <P>When the Women and Crisis Pregnancy report was published in 1998 the view of my predecessor as Minister was that it would not have been appropriate to publish a major report containing recommendations while the consultation process leading to the preparation of the Green Paper on abortion was under way. The report as published, however, contained detailed findings and conclusions, based on the research undertaken. The research team which had undertaken the study was invited to make a submission to the interdepartmental working group which was preparing the Green Paper, and such a submission was made.</P>
      <P>All submissions made in connection with the preparation of the Green Paper were treated as confidential. It has not therefore been the policy of my Department to disclose their contents. While I would have no difficulty with disclosure of the content of the submission of the Trinity research team, this is a matter for its authors in the first instance.</P>

      <P>On 16 June 1998 my Department requested disclosure of information from tobacco companies under section 5 of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection ) Act, 1988, on the constituents of tobacco products and of the amount of such constituents used in all the brands of tobacco products manufactured or imported. Several reminders were sent to the companies. Officials met with the director of the Irish tobacco manufacturers advisory committee &ndash; ITMAC &ndash; on 13 August and on 30 November 1998. On 22 December 1998 a submission was made by a solicitor on behalf of the ITMAC companies. It was <Col N="431" /> pointed out by the industry representative that there were omissions in the data supplied. The industry failed to rectify the omissions for some time.</P>
      <P>The quality of the data supplied and the manner in which it was aggregated meant that the information was of no material use from a public health perspective. This fact was brought to the companies attention at a meeting on 13 October 1999. Since that meeting further disclosures have been made. In particular, one company, Gallahers has now provided information in a satisfactory format and my officials have been assured at a meeting on 8 February with the director of ITMAC that the other companies intend to provide the same level of disclosure shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious diseases in their areas of responsibility. My Department has advised all health boards of the necessity to establish appropriate arrangements to offer asylum seekers screening for certain infectious diseases and, where necessary, follow-up treatment. The Government's policy in relation to the provision of health screening for asylum-seekers is that such screening, which is in the interests of asylum seekers, their families and the community generally, should be offered to all such persons on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>In recent months there has been a large increase in the number of persons applying for asylum in Ireland. In parallel with this, there has been a decline in the numbers availing of health screening in the Eastern Health Board region. In order to address these developments, and in line with Government policy, planning is under way at present for the establishment of asylum reception centres for short-term stay in the Dublin area. It is intended that these will include facilities for health screening, welfare and legal services. These new arrangements will enable screening to be offered in an integrated manner during the initial reception and processing of applications phase. It is hoped that in this way uptake can be maximised. The Eastern Health Board is involved, with my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the planning of the arrangements for these new facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy showed a high prevalence of tobacco consumption, alcohol and substance misuse. The health promotion unit of my Department has developed a number of initiatives aimed at tackling this problem across a range of settings as follows. The substance abuse prevention programme is a drug education programme for both primary schools in drugs task force areas and post primary schools nationwide offered through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The social, personal and health education programme is a broad based lifeskills programme which is to be offered to schools nationwide from September of this year. The Department of Education and Science with the support of my Department will be responsible for implementing this over the coming three years.</P>
      <P>Over the years a range of other programmes have been developed and implemented within schools. These programmes include the Smoke Busters programme, the teaching everyone about cancer and health &ndash; TEACH &ndash; programme and other regional and local initiatives supported by health boards and the health promotion unit.</P>
      <P>The national youth health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives including the youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue, knowledge is power and drink awareness for everyone. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to better equip them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
      <P>The Drugs Questions, Local Answers programme is a community based programme offered by regional health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drug problem specific to their own area and to look at ways in which the community can respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being well is another community based programme which encourages people to take a holis<Col N="434" /> tic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol.</P>
    <P>In addition to the education programmes being implemented for young people, teachers, youth workers and community groups-representatives, it had been acknowledged that there is also a need to target interventions on drug education at parents. A range of parenting interventions are supported by my Department at a regional and local level including The family, communication and self-esteem programme which aims to look at ways in which parents can pro-actively deal with the issue of drugs within the home.</P>
    <P>Finally, regional drugs co-ordinators have also been put in place within each health board with the specific task of leading out on a multi-sectoral approach to tackling the drugs issue on a more localised basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital in patient waiting list figures for the quarter ending 30 December 1999 are currently being collated and will be available shortly. The figures requested for the last three years are <Col N="436" /> as follows: 32,206 at 30 December 1997; 36,883 at 30 December 1998; 33,555 at 30 September 1999 (latest information available).</P>
    <P>A breakdown by hospital and specialty of the 30 September 1999 figure is shown on the following table.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the waiting times endured by many patients for access to acute hospital procedures are unacceptable. The multi-faceted nature of this problem was considered by the expert review group which reported to my predecessor in 1998. I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide-ranging measures of a short, medium and longer term nature recommended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, I believe that there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services. I intend to address these issues in forthcoming contacts with individual health board and hospital managements.  </P>

      <P>Each person presenting with a mental health problem to the health boards' mental health services is assessed and given a care plan. Support on an out-patient and, if appropriate, an in-patient basis is provided to patients with suicidal ideation. Those who are chronically suicidal are closely monitored by the mental health multidisciplinary team in liaison with the person's general practitioner. Active intervention takes place when crises occur.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent suicide and to prevent people who have attempted suicide from repeating such attempts, additional resources have been allocated this year towards the expansion of suicide prevention programmes in the health boards and to fund research aimed at improving our understanding of the causes of suicide and attempted suicide. Priority is being given to the further development of mental health services for groups at risk of suicide, in particular younger adult males and older people. Health boards are exploring ways in which mental health services can be made more accessible to such groups. It is my intention to continue to support initiatives aimed at combating this distressing social and public health problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are two nursing degree courses on offer at the National University of Ireland, Galway: a one-academic year course and a part-time course that can be undertaken over 18 or <Col N="456" /> 24 months. Following the recent Government meeting in Ballaghaderreen, the Taoiseach and my predecessor met a delegation of nursing students wishing to undertake the former course who are seeking to have their fees paid. In response to representations made to my predecessor by the students, an undertaking was given that the Department of Health and Children would investigate whether anything could be done for them.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the students concerned have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme and are entitled to register as nurses with An Bord Altranais. While undertaking the diploma programme, their third-level fees were paid by the relevant health agency and they also received an annual non-means tested maintenance grant and other supports. The difficulty with the one-academic year degree course is that it is outside the scope of the funding arrangements agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of pre-registration nursing education.</P>
    <P>The commission on nursing has recommended that no third-level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the academic year 2002-03. Since a degree in nursing is not at present a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, it is regarded as an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a degree programme are, in the same way as any other public service workers, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. It is, however, open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Most health agencies have a continuing nursing education budget and funding from this budget is used to help nurses wishing to undertake further education.</P>
    <P>My Department has given further consideration to the position of the Galway students wishing to undertake the one-academic year degree course. Unfortunately, it is simply not possible to ring fence any arrangements for these students. There are currently some 3,100 nursing students participating in the nursing diploma programmes at various third level institutions around the country, and it is expected that there will be an additional 1,500 students next autumn. It would be inequitable to meet the fees of the students who have enrolled for the degree course being provided by NUI Galway but not make similar provision for all the other nursing students.</P>
    <P>The concession being sought by the Galway students, if granted, would also give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of registered nurses undertaking degree and other courses on a part-time basis that they should also have their fees paid in full. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that there are currently in the region of 1,000 nurses undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>A further factor that must be taken into account is the importance of newly-qualified <Col N="457" /> nurses who have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme entering the workforce as soon as they are registered. If students were to delay their entry by a further year in order to undertake a degree course on a full-time basis, then this would exacerbate the difficulties that some hospitals are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, and having regard to the wider financial and other implications involved, my Department is not in a position to meet the fees of those students wishing to undertake the degree course at NUI Galway.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that flexible arrangements are in place so as to afford some choices to these students. The degree course in question is structured in such a way as to allow the students to undertake part-time nursing work. My Department understands from the Western Health Board that some of the students who did the course last year worked an average of 20-24 hours per week and earned between £150 and £300 per week. It further understands from the health board that part-time work can be offered to this year's group on a similarly flexible basis so as not to interfere with their attendance at the university.</P>

      <P>Osteoporosis is becoming increasingly prevalent in our society, due in part to the ageing of the population. Osteoporosis is an important women's health issue, however, it also occurs in males.</P>
      <P>An effective clinical osteoporosis service involves a multi-disciplinary team of health professionals offering the patient a range of skills, including clinical expertise, diagnostic services, advice on nutrition-exercise and coping with osteoporosis at home; and help in regaining mobility and independence following a fracture.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable developments in the <Col N="458" /> care and treatment of patients with cancer over the last number of years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
      <P>The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched, two co-regional directors of cancer services were appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The national cancer forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. The main areas of development included that of consultant appointments and in this context the North Eastern Health Board has had additional appointments made in medical oncology and histopathology. Dedicated funding for the development of cancer services has been allocated to the north east and since the launch of the strategy this has amounted to some £1.48 million. Funding is provided in this years allocation for the appointment of a consultant in palliative care.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme has commenced and this phase will include screening women from the North Eastern Health Board area. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services is currently being undertaken by the national cancer forum and I expect to receive recommendations on the appropriate further development of this service in the near future. When I receive these recommendations, I will give them careful consideration and I propose to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop symptomatic breast cancer services further.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to work with the national cancer forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 126 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board &ndash; BTSB &ndash; recently advertised for a second consultant haematologist to be located at its Cork centre. This appointment will be on a joint basis with Cork university hospital to which there will be a commitment of three sessions per week. The report of the committee on haematology services which was adopted by Comhairle na nOspidéal at its meeting on 17 December 1999 considered it important to ensure that the BTSB consultant haematologists provide an appropriate advisory-liaison service to relevant hospitals. Details of such enhanced services will be developed on a partnership basis between the BTSB and the Southern Health Board depending on the particular expertise of the appointee and the needs <Col N="461" /> of the hospitals in the region. The additional consultant may also provide services on a national basis depending on her-his expertise. The closing date for the applications is 9 March 2000 and I expect the BTSB and the Southern Health Board to proceed and make the joint appointment as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The BTSB considers that further capital development is desirable at its Cork centre, and has approved an outline planning brief in this regard. A more detailed planning brief is now being prepared and a project team within the BTSB has been established. As the Cork centre is located on the campus of St. Finbarr's Hospital, the BTSB has written to the Southern Health Board seeking discussions in relation to its leasehold interest in the site. My Department will consider any application from the BTSB for further capital investment in the Cork centre as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In relation to discussions with the BTSB, I met the chairperson of the board at her request on 16 February 2000 to discuss the filling of vacancies on the board. I also took the opportunity to discuss the background to the board's decision to centralise testing at the board's national headquarters. I intend to have a more substantive meeting with the board to discuss its current policies and future strategies at an early date. I will also meet with members of the Southern Health Board and representatives of the consultant staff in relation to their concerns about centralising testing.</P>

      <P>The health care system is structured to ensure that a high quality health care system is available to people based on need rather than ability to pay. This commitment to the principle of equity was reinforced in the national health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future. In the context of this underlying principle of equity, it is considered that public funds can be utilised to best effect where those who have the means to do so fund their own care or contribute to the cost of that care.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the benefit which contact with the general practitioner can offer in terms of health promotion and disease prevention. Any person with a medical card is, of course, entitled to visit their GP at any time they feel it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where people do not qualify for a medical card under income guidelines drawn up annually by health board chief executive officers, who have <Col N="462" /> statutory responsibility for the determination of eligibility, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a family's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to mention that health boards are currently undertaking a review of GP services, with a particular focus on the role of the GP in prevention and screening. One of the concerns is the capacity of general practice, as currently constituted, to undertake an enhanced role in this area.</P>

      <P>The report commissioned by the North Western Health Board into the handling of cervical smear tests by a commercial laboratory, Claymon Laboratories, on behalf of the board concluded that there was a contract between Sligo General Hospital-North Western Health Board and Claymon Laboratories for those services. This contract was made up of two elements, namely the project management and quality assurance as well as the clinical review of the cervical cytology slides screening; that Claymon Laboratories did not perform satisfactorily with regard to project management and quality assurance of the screening programme; that Claymon Laboratories did perform satisfactorily with regard to the clinical review of the slides; that Sligo General Hospital-North Western Health Board had responsibility for ensuring that the contract was appropriately let; and that Sligo General Hospital-North Western Health Board acted appropriately in commissioning a review by the Glasgow laboratory of slide results due to the particular circumstances pertaining to cervical cytology screening in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report states that the response of the pathology department of Sligo General Hospital in alerting the North Western Health Board of its concerns in relation to a number of the Claymon Laboratories' cytology results &ldquo;minimised, as far as possible, the risk to patients of misdiagnosis of the slide results and potential loss of health or life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At this stage I would like to reassure the Deputy that all of the women in question were contacted and received satisfactory and appropriate medical follow-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group on cervical screening has developed recommendations on quality assurance guidelines and these will be issued to all health board chief executive officers for implementation. While these will go some way towards <Col N="464" /> minimising incorrect results, it should be remembered that screening is a subjective exercise and relies on the human eye detecting abnormalities. As a result, all abnormalities may not be detected especially where there are few abnormal cells.</P>
    <P>In addition the expert group is also examining the role of automation in cervical screening. While automation is still at an early stage of development, its use in cervical screening should also assist in minimising the reporting of incorrect results.</P>

      <P>In October 1999 the Health Service Employers Agency extended to the Irish Medical Organisation an offer to refer to third-party adjudication the question of a fee for the provision of influenza vaccination to at-risk persons who are medical card holders. The IMO rejected this proposal, although it indicated at the same time that it had advised its members to provide the vaccine to medical card holders without charge. I remain hopeful that progress can be made on this issue in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>During the Christmas and new year period Ireland experienced a high level of serious viral and bacterial illness. This was due to a range of viral and bacterial agents, including influenza. The information available to my Department is that, of the 300,000 doses of influenza vaccine purchased in 1999, in excess of 275,000 doses were drawn down for administration by general practitioners to at-risk patients. The amount of vaccine to be ordered each year is reviewed by the health boards annually, having regard to anticipated demand. The Office for Health Gain, on behalf of the health boards, is responsible for advertising and publicity and will be considering the most appropriate approach in advance of next autumn's immunisation campaign.</P>

      <P>In this regard, my Department commissioned a report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People. This report has been published and is being considered in my Department and the health boards. One of the key issues addressed was that of training and I will be paying particular attention to this aspect. A sum of £1.5 million was provided to the health boards in 1999 for expansion and development of the home help service, including training. This sum, together with an additional £0.78 million has been repeated this year.</P>
      <P>In further recognition of the contribution of home helps, improvements have been made to their pay and it is my objective for the coming year to implement the national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour with effect from 1 April 2000, an increase from £3 per hour minimum in April 1999.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are continuing under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency in respect of all aspects of status, pay and working conditions for home helps. These talks are taking place in the context of the national council on ageing and older people's report.</P>
      <P>The management team, which includes representatives of the Health Service Employers Agency, my Department and the health boards, last met with the unions representing home helps on Tuesday, 22 February 2000.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, in association with the Labour Court, all outstanding issues will be resolved by the end of April.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is normal practice that when new units are completed under major developments such as have taken place in these hospitals recently, they are normally commissioned on a phased basis as the additional revenue funding required becomes <Col N="466" /> available. This year my Department provided £4.15 million to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of the commissioning of new units, including the theatres, which were completed under phases I and II of the redevelopment of Limerick regional hospital. In relation to Tallaght hospital my Department provided £2.718 million this year to meet the commissioning costs arising from service developments in a number of areas at the hospital, also including the theatres.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently involved in discussions with the management of both the Mid-Western Health Board and Tallaght hospital to agree a programme of commissioning which will maximise the impact of the available funding.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards to enable them to fund measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Research, such as the women and crisis pregnancy report published in 1998, has identified a range of issues regarding the availability of family planning and related services as well as the attitudes of young people to sexual behaviour, which impact on the incidence of unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area. However as services are still in the process of development, it is as yet too early to assess their impact. The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational-promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity. Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis without any waiting period and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and thereby reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is planning a public relations campaign which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The national children's strategy is currently being prepared for Government by an interdepartmental group, under the chairmanship of the Department of Health and Children. A cross-departmental team, drawn from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is working to the interdepartmental group to prepare the strategy.</P>
      <P>An outline of the document has been developed and work is now progressing on preparing the detailed proposals. It is intended that the strategy should address the need to develop our research and information base; recommend more effective ways of obtaining the views of children and set out proposals on how to improve co-ordination and planning in the provision of children's services.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive consultation process with all of the interested parties is now under way. Public submissions on the strategy were requested through the national media and over 170 submissions have been received to date.</P>
      <P>Consultation with children and young people will be an important element in developing the strategy. The Children's Rights Alliance is working with the cross-departmental team to provide children and young people with a range of opportunities to have their views heard. One aspect of this consultation process is the setting up of a dedicated e-mail address &ndash;  minister for children@health.irlgov.ie &ndash; operational from today, which children and all young people are invited to use to submit suggestions, comments and any observations they feel would contribute towards the formation of the national children's strategy.</P>
      <P>The relevant statutory bodies are also now engaged in the development of the strategy. Two advisory panels have been formed, a research and information panel and a non-governmental service providers panel, to advise on the development of the strategy.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to have a document to the Government this summer, with a view to early publication.</P>

These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details in such cases and included a provision for the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parents with co-operation of the other parent. They also provided for the registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 154 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1999 the proposal from the NDSC to lease accommodation in Blanchardstown was discussed by the Minister and his officials. The Minister expressed concern about the very high costs of the proposed accommodation and decided that the centre should be relocated in the midland region as part of the decentralisation process. The Minister also requested that his officials meet with the chairman and director of the NDSC to convey his decision to them.</P>
      <P>Due to other commitments, the parties involved were unable to meet earlier than 12 November 1999. At this meeting it was explained that in line with the Government's commitment to decentralisation, it was the Minister's intention to relocate the NDSC outside Dublin to the midland region. It was also pointed out that the high cost of accommodation was a factor in the Minister's thinking. A further meeting took place between the Department and representatives of the NDSC on 30 November 1999.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the need for the National Disease Surveillance Centre to have access to the expertise of a consultant microbiologist to assist in the surveillance of anti-microbial resistant infections. The centre may make interim arrangements with a hospital for the provision of such expertise pending the joint appointment of a consultant microbiologist between the National Disease Surveillance Centre and a hospital.</P>
      <P>I met with the chairman and director of the National Disease Surveillance Centre yesterday and they outlined their concerns about the implications of the proposed relocation. I am considering the points which they made and I will communicate with them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues raised by Sligo Action Against Fluoride.</P>
      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation &ndash; I have arranged for a copy of this report to be forwarded to the Deputy. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960. A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. If an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there is an issue of public health significance relating to the use of fluoride in water which should be investigated, my Department would support this research in the usual manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The current uptake of MMR &ndash; measles-mumps-rubella &ndash; vaccine nationally is approximately 77%, while the target uptake is 95%. This is a cause for serious concern and my Department has recently written to all the health boards requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the issues which boards have been asked to address are the need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases <Col N="473" /> are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>
    <P>The uptake of the MMR vaccine is believed to have been adversely affected by reports which purport to link it to the development of certain conditions or disorders. I would like to take this opportunity to address these concerns. My Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is a very safe and effective one. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine. I would therefore urge all parents to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which may be given from the age of 15 months and which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles and other serious diseases.</P>

      <P>An official from my Department, in conjunction with officials from the Southern Health Board, recently met with members of the Tralee senior citizens group and local representatives in connection with the provision of a community hospital in Tralee. The official clarified that the provision of a community hospital for older people in Tralee is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The need for such a facility is recognised by the Southern Health Board and it has included this project in its development plan for community hospitals. However, the board has indicated to my Department that the nature of the service to be provided by a community hospital in Tralee can only be determined after a range of other services relating to the care of older people is first put in place. These include assessment and rehabilitation units at Tralee general hospital which are now in place; community support services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy; a day hospital at Tralee general hospital which is now in planning and the provision of a replacement community hospital at Dingle. It is the intention to continue to provide financial assistance, both capital and revenue, to the Southern Health Board for the development of services for older people in its area. In this connection, capital funding to enhance services for older people is included in the national development plan. In this regard, it will be a matter for the board to determine its priorities for the development of this service in County Kerry prior to the submission of proposals to my Department.</P>

      <P>The recent consultation document  &ndash; Making Knowledge Work for Health &ndash; Towards a Strategy for Research and Innovation for Health &ndash; to which the Deputy is referring was prepared by the Health Research Board at the invitation of my Department and it has been widely circulated to interested parties. The purpose of this consultative process is to develop research as a means to achieve the major goals of the health services and to maximise the potential of the health research community. When this is completed, my Department will work closely with the Health Research Board to address the issues identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the level of funding available for health research in this country compares unfavourably with countries at a similar stage of development and with similar health services, the funding available for health research has steadily increased in recent years. The report of the science, technology and innovation advisory council &ndash; STIAC report &ndash; recommended that the HRB's funding be increased to £5 million. The board's revenue allocation for 2000 is £6.803 million. In addition I am also allocating £700,000 capital funding for research equipment. Both of these figures represent increases of approxi<Col N="476" /> mately 32% and 40% respectively over last year's figures.</P>
    <P>In addition, biotechnology is one of the two areas on which funding from the technology foresight fund, now established by Government, will be concentrated and I am confident that health research will benefit significantly from this funding.</P>

      <P>Further to the proposed introduction of a 48 hour working week for NCHDs it has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to undertake a study of hospital doctors' working hours.

      <P>A very small proportion of tuberculosis cases diagnosed in Ireland has been identified as drug-resistant. In 1998, resistance was documented in seven cases. None of these cases were multi-drug resistant &ndash; MDR.</P>
      <P>The report of the working party on tuberculosis, published in 1996, concluded that while, compared to some European countries, drug resistant strains of tuberculosis are rare in Ireland, the potential exists for an increase in this problem.</P>

It continues to keep under review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis and will continue to monitor the prevalence of antibiotic resistant tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, and the problem of antimicrobial resistance.</P>

      <P>While some people with substance abuse problems undoubtedly, become homeless, I am not aware of any evidence to indicate that mentally ill persons with associated substance abuse frequently become homeless. I might add that the Eastern Health Board is developing a range of services for homeless people. It operates a residential unit for the homeless mentally ill in St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman, together with a day service at Usher's Island, Dublin. A specialised outreach service for this group of people, working closely with voluntary agencies, is also provided by the board and additional funding of £130,000 was provided by my Department this year to develop a consultant led psychiatric team to work specifically with the homeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My role and responsibility in this area relates to the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of <Col N="480" /> pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million &ndash; capital and revenue &ndash; was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000. In addition, a small number of grants are normally made available from national lottery funding.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care over the next seven years under the national development plan 2000-06. This funding will facilitate the child care measures which were announced in budget 2000. The main objectives of the new measures is an increase in the quantity of child care places and also an improvement in the quality of services available. These measures comprise the equal opportunities child care programme which includes grant supports to establish, upgrade, enhance and staff community based child care facilities; capital grants for private providers of child care catering for up to 20 child care places; grants to develop local child care networks; and supports to enhance national voluntary child care organisations which provide advice, support and training to child care service providers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is finalising the criteria and the eligibility requirements for the grant schemes at present and it intends to begin promoting the various initiatives shortly in the national media.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was announced in Budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 (the allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission).</P>
    <P>The implementation of the child care measures will be facilitated by the establishment of an interdepartmental committee on child care, a national co-ordinating child care committee and county child care committees. My Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee on child care and on the national co-ordinating child care committee. The health boards are represented on the national co-ordinating child care <Col N="481" /> committee and the county child care committees will be led by the relevant health boards. These committees will liaise locally and nationally on child care.</P>

      <P>I am arranging to get the views of health board management on the level of unmet need and how this need can best be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>On 14 December last, Judge Alison Lindsay, chairperson of the tribunal of inquiry into the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia and related matters, ruled on an application on behalf of the Irish Haemophilia Society for an interim order as to costs. The chairperson ruled that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to grant an interim order for costs to any party and that, therefore, she was precluded from making an interim order in relation to costs in favour of the society.</P>
      <P>Immediately after this ruling was delivered, counsel for the Department of Health and Children informed the tribunal that the Department was prepared to consider, on a strictly without prejudice basis and not on the basis of any legal obligation to do so, the question of providing remuneration to legal representatives of the society appearing at public sittings of the tribunal. Counsel went on to indicate that the Department was prepared to have discussions with the society in relation to such matters as the amount and timing of any such payments and the avoidance of double benefit if the society were, in due course, to be awarded their costs in whole or in part by the tribunal. It was also indicated that the Department was determined that any such discussions would not delay the commencement of public sittings of the tribunal and would not be in contempt of the powers of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>On 17 December, an offer of exceptional financial assistance was made to the society on a strictly without prejudice basis. The main features of the offer were that: a sum amounting to two-thirds of counsel's brief fee to be made available by the Department, at the same rate as that set for the Department's counsel, in respect of not more than two senior counsel and two junior counsel; a sum amounting to two-thirds of the refresher fees payable thereafter to counsel to be made available, at the same rate as that set for the Department's counsel, in respect of certified attendance by the society's counsel at sitting days of the tribunal; two-thirds of the society's solicitors fees to be made available, at the same rate as that set for the tribunal's solicitor, in respect of certified attendance by the society's solicitor at sitting days of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>To date, the society has not given a definitive response to that offer. However, the society has recently issued legal proceedings on the question of costs, including the costs of the society's expert witnesses, against the tribunal, Ireland and the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to expert witnesses before the tribunal is that parties represented at the tribunal are free to suggest to the tribunal expert witnesses who they feel would be in a position to give relevant evidence, and, indeed, are encouraged to do so. In the event of a witness recommended by the society being called by the <Col N="483" /> tribunal, his or her expenses will be met by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I met the society on 16 February and again yesterday, 23 February. Both meetings were expressed to be without prejudice to the High Court proceedings instituted by the society. Accordingly, I am not prepared to disclose the content of the discussions at those meetings.</P>
    <P>I do wish to record, however, that my Department has adopted a fair and open minded approach to the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to these matters. Any assistance to the society which is publicly funded must, however, conform with the highest standards of accountability and must include mechanisms to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I must also ensure that, while seeking to address the society's concerns in relation to costs, I do nothing to interfere with the jurisdiction of the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>Benzodiazepines are controlled drugs &ndash; tranquillisers &ndash; which are available only on prescription from medical practitioners. I am aware that concerns have been raised about the inappropriate prescribing of these drugs to opiate misusers by a small number of general practitioners.</P>
      <P>As part of an external review of drug services for the Eastern Health Board, which was carried out in 1999 an analysis was made over a four month period of urine tests in five of the board's drug treatment clinics. This analysis showed that over that period 65% of the clients attending the clinics tested positive for benzodiazepines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998 had a major impact on limiting the availability of methadone on the illicit market. The situation regarding benzodiazepines is, however, not as clearcut as for methadone. Even in health board treatment clinics benzodiazepines may be legitimately prescribed to drug misusers, so there is an issue around determining clinical guidelines for <Col N="484" /> management of drug misusers and appropriate dosages of various medications.</P>
    <P>My Department's officials have written to all general practitioners on a number of occasions concerning the need for them to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs, including benzodiazepines. In the most recent letter, 30 August 1999, from my Department's chief medical officer to all general practitioners, he advised doctors to contact health board GP co-ordinators on best clinical practice in relation to treatment of opiate misusers, and he gave contact names and phone numbers where assistance could be obtained. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, of course, I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering what further action is required to minimise the availability of these drugs on the illicit market.</P>

      <P>The number of new cases of HIV reported from January 1999 to the end of September 1999 is 151. Full year figures will be available in the coming weeks. The number of new HIV cases for each year 1995 to 1998 is as follows: 1994 &ndash; 85; 1995 &ndash; 91; 1996 &ndash; 106; 1997 &ndash; 119; 1998 &ndash; 136.</P>
      <P>The above figures indicate that the numbers of reported cases of HIV have increased in the past few years. These statistics show that we cannot become complacent about HIV-AIDS and that there is still a need for increased education and awareness to prevent the spread of the disease. The health promotion unit of my Department engages in a number of education programmes such as a mass media campaign; emphasis on condom usage through TV and radio campaigns as a means of preventing the spread of HIV; convenience advertising involving the placement of AIDS awareness messages in washroom-toilet areas of third level colleges, women's health clinics, selected entertainment venues etc. where they are guaranteed to be viewed by patrons entering theses areas; AIDS resource materials for second level schools and publication of guidelines for effective HIV-AIDS education.</P>
      <P>Health boards also fund voluntary agencies who are involved with the local community in providing education and prevention messages in the area of HIV-AIDS.</P>
      <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee is at an advanced stage of preparing a new policy document on HIV-AIDS. One important area which will be addressed in this new policy is the issue of education and prevention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital security is generally provided 24 hours per day, 365 days per year on a contract basis by private security firms and the nature and extent of the security provided will vary depending on the security requirements at individual hospital sites. Both static and mobile security personnel are utilised together with a range of security <Col N="486" /> devices which may include closed-circuit television cameras located at strategic areas on a hospital campus.</P>
    <P>The incident referred to by the Deputies occurred at St James's on the evening of Monday, 7 February 2000 during normal visiting hours in a private room. The hospital's security staff apprehended the alleged assailant and detained him until the gardaí arrived. The alleged assailant is in the custody of gardaí and hospital authorities are assisting the gardaí in the matter.</P>
    <P>The security of patients, staff and visitors in our hospitals is a matter of concern to all who are involved in the delivery of health care and every effort is made by management on individual hospital sites to ensure that adequate and efficient security personnel-systems are in place to ensure this. In this regard, all hospital security systems are reviewed by individual hospital authorities on an on-going basis and updated and strengthened where necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, to the above, the Eastern Health Board's accident and emergency steering group has established a committee to examine the number and level of violent incidents occurring at accident and emergency departments in the region. On completion of this examination measures aimed at reducing such incidents and increasing staff protection will be assessed and implemented where appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion of breastfeeding is supported by the health promotion unit of my Department in a number of ways in line with the national breastfeeding policy. In prioritising the recommendations of that policy and how they might be implemented it was recognised that the support of health professionals would be critical. They are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Consequently, the National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. This training pack has been widely disseminated.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the baby friendly hospital initiative. This global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. The initiative has recently been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit also continues to be involved in ensuring that the other recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy are implemented. Other initiatives undertaken to achieve this include the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding and supporting voluntary organisations such as La Leche League, Cuidiú, Irish Childbirth Trust, and the Association of Lactation Consultants, to further promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise that the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit is committed to continue its support for the implementation of the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. I am confident that the continuing implementation of the recommendations and particularly the grow<Col N="488" /> ing participation in the baby friendly hospital initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, in my reply to similar questions on 8 February, steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This major project will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access to and management of the archival records and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. It will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country, including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the general register office. There is also an ongoing review of the registration service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have also indicated in recent replies regarding this service, additional space was provided in the public reading room in Joyce House in July 1999. Tenders have been sought for the <Col N="489" /> further refurbishment of the general register office which will include additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and the improvement of customer services on the second floor of the office.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care over the next seven years under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the child care measures which were announced in Budget 2000. The main objective of the new measures is an increase in the quantity of child care places and also an improvement in the quality of services available. These measures comprise: the equal opportunities child care programme which includes grant supports to establish, upgrade, enhance and staff community based child care facilities; capital grants for private providers of child care catering for up to 20 child care places; grants to develop local child care networks and supports to enhance national voluntary child care organisations which provide advice, support and training to child care service providers.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is finalising the criteria and the eligibility requirements for the grant schemes at present and it intends to begin promoting the various initiatives shortly in the national media.</P>
      <P>In addition, it was announced in budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, the allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 92, 95, 184, 185 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The survey of nursing vacancies which the Deputies refer to was carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, and related to the position at 30 September 1999. This was the most comprehensive report to date and covered all agencies and nursing disciplines. The survey found that there were 1,180.46 vacancies in gross terms at 30 September. The net figure when adjustments are made for the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime working is 428.16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results confirmed again that there is not a nationwide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin <Col N="491" /> area far exceeds the number of positions available.</P>
    <P>While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another. This is illustrated by a telephone survey of five major voluntary hospitals in Dublin which was carried out by the Department within the last week, and which found that the up to date vacancy position in three &ndash; Beaumont, Mater and St. James's &ndash; has improved while the position has disimproved in Tallaght and St. Vincent's, Elm Park.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy McManus's question, it is not possible to introduce an additional quality of working life payment for nurses working in Dublin. It would not be possible to ring-fence such a payment to Dublin or indeed to nurses. The Deputy may be interested to note that the Irish Nurses Organisation rejected the concept of a &ldquo;Dublin weighting&rdquo; at its 1999 annual conference.</P>
    <P>The total number of nurses employed in the public health service on 31 December 1998 was 31,266, 26,695 whole-time equivalents. This compares with 50,544 nurses on the active register of An Bord Altranais in January 2000. Some 3,100 student nurses are in training at the moment. The 2000 intake will be 1,500, an increase of 300 over 1999. This increased figure was agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the recent nurses' strike. A further 20 places are available on a new direct entry midwifery programme which will be introduced on a pilot basis next June.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be definitive as to the total nursing complement required to provide adequate staffing for hospitals. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a joint committee rep<Col N="492" /> resentative of nursing unions and health service employers. This committee is in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>
    <P>These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments; a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced; discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff; standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions; health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities in relation to the introduction of term time working as an option for staff with family commitments; the availability of return to working courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the workforce is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake; my Department is engaged in discussions with health agencies in relation to the provision of specialist nursing courses at centres outside Dublin. As a result, ten students commenced a one-year higher diploma in specialist nursing in Letterkenny General Hospital last month and six students commenced a higher diploma in nursing, critical care in University College Hospital Galway. A further course is planned for Waterford Regional Hospital; an anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and was published in December 1999; the promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing; a study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following on from this, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the health research board and awarded to the Department of Nursing Studies, NUI, Cork; my Department is in discussions with the relevant Departments and with An Bord Altranais regarding entry visas-work permits for nurses recruited from outside the European Union or European Economic Area. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that there are no unnecessary barriers to entry.</P>
    <P>In this context, data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. The figures in relation to registrations are as follows:<Col N="493" /></P>

    <P>Attracting Applicants to Study Nursing: In 1999, following a national and local recruitment campaign funded by the Department, the number of applicants increased by 40% over 1998. This resulted in the largest number of direct entrants to nursing for several years, i.e. a total of 1, 215 training places were filled.</P>
    <P>Due to the success of last year's campaign, funding totalling £400,000 has been made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns this year aimed at promoting nursing as a career. The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, increased from £2,500 to £3,250 between 1997 and 1999. The rate will increase again to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify.</P>
    <P>In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms are also being increased. The range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programme has been expanded.</P>
    <P>The requirement to have a foreign language in the leaving certificate has been removed.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the significant increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Under the Health Act, 1970, regulation of the number and type of consultant appointments is the statutory responsibility of Comhairle na nOspidéal. I have been advised that comhairle, in exercise of its statutory functions, has identified 21 consultant posts which have been vacant for more than five years where the replacement process has not been initiated or completed by the relevant employing authorities. I am further advised that comhairle has contacted the employing authorities concerned seeking reasons for the delay in filling the posts in question and I understand that this matter will be considered further by Comhairle na nOspidéal in the light of submissions from the employing authorities concerned. My Department will consider this matter further in the light of the conclusions reached by Comhairle na nOspidéal following consideration of submissions from the relevant employing authorities.</P>

      <P>As already advised to the House on 27 January and 1 and 16 February last, the Adoption Board is an independent statutory body established under the Adoption Act, 1952, and is responsible for the administration of adoption law. As the primary body responsible for adoption matters it has developed a specialised knowledge of the issues surrounding adoption, both domestic and intercountry. Its experience and expertise in this area is well established. My predecessor, Deputy Frank Fahey, outlined in detail the reasoning behind the Adoption Board's decision on 27 January. Since this matter is now the subject of High Court proceedings, I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The casemix adjustments which were applied to the 2000 determinations of expenditure are set out in the following table. I wish to firmly reject the <Col N="495" /> suggestion that the casemix system places financial considerations ahead of the welfare of patients. The casemix system uses clinical information which is based on the actual practice of medicine in Irish hospitals to determine a proportion of the funding for hospitals. The decision to admit or discharge a patient is rightly a clinical decision to be made by the individual doctor in respect of the individual patient. The manner in which hospital services in this country are organised, including the contract which hospital consultants hold, recognises this clinical autonomy explicitly.</P>
      <P>Measures of the average length-of-stay for clinically comparable groups of patients are arrived at using information on clinical practice as it relates to over 340,000 inpatient cases in the 31 hospitals throughout the country which participate in the casemix system. The measures against which hospitals are compared in respect of length of stay are, therefore, set by the practice of doctors in the Irish hospital system and place patients and clinical practice at the centre of the resource allocation process.</P>
      <P>All funding allocated under casemix remains within the hospital system and any funding deducted from hospitals is distributed to the other hospitals on the basis of their positive performance under casemix. Finally, I would like to say that it would be most regrettable if the casemix system, which transparently allocates funding on the basis of information derived directly from patient care, were represented as an attempt to impose arbitrary limits on clinical practice.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Deputy to my response to previous questions on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced on budget day last that additional funding would be made available from 1 January 2000 to support the application of the domiciliary care allowance scheme introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973 to eligible children under two years of age.</P>
      <P>The modification was confined to the age eligibility criterion only. Other criteria, as outlined in Circular No. 24/73, have not been altered. It should be noted that the circular also points out, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</P>
      <P>The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance.... It is not intended that the scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. It is not visualised that any particular condition should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits....</P>
      <P>I have asked officials in my Department to consult with the health board chief executive officers in order to obtain the views of the senior area medical officers on the specific issues raised by the Deputy in his question.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent figures produced by the OECD showing that health spending here, as a percentage of GDP, was below most other OECD countries; the steps, if any, he is taking to bring health spending closer into line with the OECD norm, particularly in view of the serious shortcomings in the health service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest available figures produced by the OECD refer to the position for 1997. Since taking up office in mid 1997 this Government has increased health spending by £1,051 million or <Col N="497" /> 38%. The allocation to health will for the first time exceed £4 billion.</P>
      <P>The Government, having regard to the extent of unmet needs and our increasing wealth, has implemented unprecedented increases in the real level of health expenditure each year. The very substantial additional funds being made available will bring per <i>capita</i> spending more into line with other EU and OECD countries. I am particularly pleased that the £2 billion in capital funding provided in the national development plan will allow the physical infrastructure to be put in place which must go hand in hand with the increase in day to day revenue spending being made by this Government.</P>
      <P>However, caution does need to be exercised in analysing the OECD figures referred to by the Deputy. Regard needs to be paid to the relative cost effectiveness of different systems and the different demographic profiles of the various countries in interpreting these figures. In a review published in 1997 the OECD acknowledged that the Irish health care system results &ldquo;in good provision of health care at relatively low cost to the taxpayer&rdquo;. One needs hardly look beyond the health care debate in other countries to see that high per <i>capita</i> spending does not automatically equate to a high quality, equitable and comprehensive system for all citizens. In addition, this country is not yet carrying the burden which falls on most other EU countries in providing services for the very high proportion of their populations which are old or very old. In planning for the future it is important that lessons are learned from the experience of other countries in this regard so that the configuration of services takes proper account of the changing demographic profile which is projected over the coming decades.</P>

    <P>Note: Data for 1996 to 1998 are provisional.</P>
    <P>Source: Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The figures show a substantial increase over the period. There has been a parallel rise in the female population aged 15-19 years between 1994 and 1998 but this explains only a small part of the increase in numbers. The birth rate for the age group has gone up from 15 births per 1,000 population in 1994 to 18.6 in 1998. It should, however be emphasised that the rate for 1994 was the lowest recorded since the 1960's.</P>
    <P>In general, fluctuations in fertility rates need to be examined over periods covering more than five years. For all age groups, with the exception of females under the age of 20, the last few decades have been characterised by long-term declines in fertility rates. For the 15-19 age group, there was a significant rise in rates between 1960 and 1980, a fall between 1980 and 1985 and a reasonably steady situation since then. From 1985 until 1997, birth rates in 15-19 year olds have varied between 15 and 17.3 births per 1,000 population. There was a slight increase in rates in the late 1980's, followed by a gradual decline from 1991 to 1994, followed in turn by the present rise in rates. The effect of this has been that the birth rate to young mothers in 1997 was almost identical to the rate pertaining in 1991. While the 1998 figure is an increase over the previous year, considerable care should be taken in interpreting the figures which can, as indicated, show considerable variance from year to year with, for example, the 1980 rate being 23.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes, covering large segments of the population, are introduced. Reliable screening techniques for breast cancer and cervical cancer are now well established internationally.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. The national cancer forum, an expert advisory body established by one of my predecessors, has given this matter some consideration and has recently established an expert sub group to examine whether there would be benefit in introducing further screening programmes for cancer, including bowel cancer. I await the forum's considered recommendation in this regard.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, more than £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the pub<Col N="500" /> lic. As nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the list.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know, however, that I have asked the advisory forum to the heart health task force to bring forward proposals in regard to nicotine replacement therapy and the less well off sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>The Department's health promotion unit conducts national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The most recent anti-smoking campaign, Break the Habit for Good, was launched in December 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an Advice Kit which in turn offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign continues, by a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>

      <P>The impact of people suffering from flu-type illnesses on the acute hospital system was felt in terms of increased demand for in-patient care and the capacity of the system to respond to this demand in terms of available beds.</P>
      <P>A significant increase in patients attending accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region was experienced in December 1999 and January 2000 and approximately 25% of these attendances required admission. The majority of these patients were aged 65 years and over and the nature of the illnesses were such that patients could not be discharged after two or three days as might be expected. The average length of stay for such patients was seven to ten days and this impacted hugely on each hospital's capacity to cater for elective admissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased attendance at accident and emergency departments during the winter period by persons with flu or flu-like symptoms is a feature of acute accident and emergency service departments. In this regard my Department has allocated significant funding to such hospitals in recent years to enable them to implement measures aimed at reducing pressure on their <Col N="501" /> accident and emergency departments. This fund-ing amounted to £2.3 million in 1998, £2 million in 1999 and £2 million in 2000. The measures have included minor capital works to improve accident and emergency facilities, new equipment and enhanced staffing levels. A publicity campaign aimed at persuading people with flu or flu-like symptoms to attend their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department has also been a feature of accident and emergency Winter Initiatives in recent years.</P>
    <P>In response to a request from my Department the Eastern Health Board's Accident and Emergency Steering Group submitted an action plan aimed at alleviating pressure in accident and emergency departments. The plan proposed that 235 additional beds in sub-acute care facilities be provided to allow patients who have completed the acute phase of their illness to be discharged from acute hospitals and to be accommodated in facilities more appropriate to their needs. This plan was accepted by my Department and funding of £2 million capital and revenue was provided in 1999 to facilitate the provision of these additional beds on a phased basis. By the end of December, 195 of these beds had been provided, some on the campuses of acute hospitals, and the remaining forty will be in place in the very near future. My Department has provided an additional £5 million to guarantee the continuation of these additional beds.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Office for Health Gain, on behalf of the health boards, which is responsible for advertising and publicity of influenza vaccinations, will be considering the most appropriate manner to encourage persons considered most at risk from influenza to avail of the vaccination in advance of next winter. My Department will also be reviewing the position with regard to the provision of the flu vaccine to key health sector workers.</P>

All significant research is monitored here by the Department of Public Enterprise with whom my Department liaises.

The balance of scientific and medical research to date has not conclusively established a casual link between electric and magnetic fields associated <Col N="502" /> with power lines and any significant public health risk.</P>
      <P>However research is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields.

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the £560 million provision in the national development plan for a technology foresight fund. This fund is an integral element of the £1.95 billion provision in the plan for research, technological development and innovation. This unprecedented level of investment, which represents almost 5% of the total funding outlined in the plan, is evidence of the high priority this Government attaches to the role of research and innovation in driving future economic growth.</P>
      <P>The technology foresight fund responds to the recommendations of the <i>Technology Foresight Ireland Reports</i>, published last year by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. ICSTI sought to identify the technologies that could contribute most to economic development in the future and present a plan of the actions needed now to ensure that Ireland can exploit those technologies. The report recommended that my Department should establish a fund for investment in research in niche areas of information and communications technologies and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I have been carrying out an extensive consultation process with the objective of preparing detailed proposals for Government on the most appropriate mechanism to disburse this funding and we will be announcing the outcome of this process shortly.</P>

      <P>On Monday 14 February the High Court appointed a liquidator to Kel Electronics on foot of a petition by one of its creditors to have the company wound up. The company was stated to have debts of more than £430,000 and all creditors supported the winding-up petition. As normal in a High Court liquidation, the legal position is that all contracts of employment in the company are terminated following the appointment of the liquidator, who is now assessing the statutory entitlements of the workforce. It is now the responsibility of the liquidator to assess the financial position of the company and its future prospects.</P>
      <P>Regarding labour payments, the liquidator completed all appropriate documentation relating to &ldquo;employee statutory redundancy&rdquo;, &ldquo;arrears of wages and holiday pay&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum notice entitlements&rdquo; by 22 February. The average period required to process claims for employee statutory redundancy is about four to six weeks and for claims in respect of arrears of wages and holiday pay, four to eight weeks. On receipt of the completed &ldquo;statutory redundancy&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrears of wages and holiday pay&rdquo; forms from the liquidator, my Department will process these claims without delay.</P>
      <P>Regarding claims for &ldquo;minimum notice entitlements&rdquo;, the employees' entitlements have to be established at a hearing of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The adjudication of these claims can, accordingly, take up to three months. As soon as a decision of the tribunal has issued to the parties concerned, my Department will ensure that payment will be made as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is already working with the liquidator regarding prospective investors. A number have been identified and have been made known to the liquidator.</P>

      <P>Total expenses of the Patents Office, as reported <Col N="505" /> in the annual reports of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, amounted to £3,229,006.85 in 1997 and £3,763,901.64 in 1998. I am advised that the figure for 1999 is in course of preparation in the Patents Office in the context of its forthcoming annual report for that year.</P>
      <P>As regards the development or expansion of the office, the organisational and resource requirements of the Patents Office are kept under ongoing review in the light of current demands on its services.</P>
      <P>Regarding the number of copyright referrals currently before the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, the Controller has reported to me as follows: under section 31 of the Copyright Act, 1963, disputes between persons using sound recordings in public and the owner of copyright subsisting in the recordings regarding the equitable remuneration payable to the copyright owner may be referred to the Controller for determination. In the period September 1989 to December 1995 62 references under section 31 were made by establishments using sound recordings, mainly discos and hotels.</P>
      <P>Early in 1991, while the procedures preliminary to hearings of the earliest referred disputes were in train, the licensing body, Phonographic Performance, Ireland, Limited &ndash; the respondent in the proceedings, put the legal basis upon which the references had been made, section 31 at issue. The controller's findings that such references had properly been made under section 31 gave rise to judicial review proceedings before the High Court, initiated by the licensing body. The respondents in these proceedings included certain of the establishments which had made references to the controller. In October 1992 the High Court found that the references should have been made under section 32 of the Act &ndash; not section 31 &ndash; and prohibited the controller from proceeding further with the applications. Judicial review of the High Court's finding was sought of the Supreme Court by one of the respondents. In a judgment delivered on 1 October 1995 the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court, leaving the controller free to proceed with the references on hand.</P>
      <P>Following further consideration and consultations with the parties, the controller, by order dated July 1996, appointed an arbitrator in relation to the disputes between Phonographic Performance, Ireland, Limited and the various discos and hotels.</P>
      <P>During the period where proceedings were before the courts and prior to the appointment of the arbitrator, several of the discos and hotels involved either ceased trading or settled with the respondent.. At the time of the arbitrator's appointment, 55 of the references remained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time was lost in getting the arbitration under way because one of the parties put at issue the question of liability for the arbitrator's fees. Eventually, this issue was resolved following receipt of legal advice, on the basis that liability was to be met by the State. Agreement was then <Col N="506" /> reached with the arbitrator on his fees and he was asked to proceed with the work. In March 1998 the arbitrator indicated that he would be in a position to take oral hearings in September 1998 and he subsequently indicated that he had had discussions with the parties about moving the process forward. The determination of the arbitrator is awaited.</P>
    <P>In December 1997 an arbitrator's brief fee of £5,000, less withholding tax of £1,074.38, was paid in respect of the disputes between disco and hotel owners and Phonographic Protection, Ireland, Limited, and there have been no further payments in that case since. On 4 February 1998 the controller appointed an arbitrator to deal with a dispute between RTE and Phonographic Performance, Ireland, Limited, again under section 31 of the Copyright Act, 1963. This dispute was settled in 1998 and the arbitration cost involved was £18,150, less withholding tax of £3,600.</P>

    <P>The current apprenticeship system is standards-based and is aimed at ensuring that pre-set levels of skill and competence are attained by participants. The standards-based apprenticeship system, which replaced the time-served model in 1993, consists of seven phases of training.

      <P>The primary purpose of community employment is to act as a transitional programme to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. Operational responsibility for the delivery of the programme, including project selection and appraisal, comes within the remit of FÁS as part of their responsibilities under the Labour Services Act, 1987.</P>
      <P>Following a restructuring of CE in July 1999 participation on the programme is being reduced over a five year period. It is FÁS policy that projects providing quality work experience for participants and worthwhile services to community groups will get priority, particularly where they lead to good progression to further education-training or employment. While there are currently participants on projects working in graveyards the type of experience gained does not, in general, lead to good progression opportunities. Environmental-type work of this nature is classified as low priority and is not being continued as part of the CE programme in certain areas.</P>

      <P>With regard to the particular situation of Mr. Juan Raul Garza, I understand from Amnesty International that his case has been brought to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The commission has asked that the US Government do not proceed with the execution until it has issued a judgment. As of now, no date has been set for his execution. If the execution proceeds, Mr. Garza would be the first federal prisoner to suffer capital punishment in over 36 years. This would mark a distinct expansion of the implementation of the death penalty in the USA. Ireland, in conjunction with our EU partners under the union's common policy on this issue, is campaigning for the USA to introduce a moratorium on capital punishment. I will ensure that this specific case is brought to the attention of our EU partners as a matter of urgency and that consideration be given to intervention on behalf of Mr. Garza.</P>

Much needed reforms are being undertaken, including reform of the military and the establishment of the rule of law. However, tensions and conflicts have arisen for social, sectarian or separatist reasons in several regions of the country, including the island of Halmahera and elsewhere in the Moluccas. The killing and persecution of persons on religious grounds is a further cause of particu<Col N="510" /> lar concern including, I believe, to President Wahid and his Government.</P>
      <P>Our concerns are fully shared by our EU partners, and the Indonesian Government has been made aware of them. The Union has further made clear that it wishes to see a strong, united and democratic Indonesia which can address these problems as well as their root causes. In this perspective Ireland is ready, together with our EU partners, to provide support and assistance to Indonesia.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned at the situation in Halmahera. This is one of the issues that we are considering together with our EU partners, in the context of the protection of human rights in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The restoration of public order is the responsibility of the Indonesian Government. Indonesia has not sought external assistance, and, in the absence of a request from Indonesia, a legal basis for international peace-keeping does not currently exist. However, I envisage that EU assistance cover such matters as good governance, and within that context I shall urge that attention be paid to the vital aspects of responsible civic leadership and reconciliation.</P>

BGE have indicated that this would allow for the supply of natural gas to a number of towns, including Mul<Col N="511" /> lingar. Decisions on the route and towns to be served would be a matter for BGE to make on the basis of investment criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to previous parliamentary questions in regard to radon gas, most recently my response to Parliamentary Question No. 51 on 15 February 2000 and No. 135 on 1 February 2000.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to those parliamentary questions, the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and in highlighting public awareness of radon. I also outlined some of the measures being undertaken by Government in tackling radon, particularly in relation to domestic dwellings and schools.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government's advice booklet <i>Radon in Buildings,</i> which is available from the Government Publications Sales Office, provides advice to householders and builders on preventative and remedial measures which can be undertaken in new and existing buildings to reduce high radon concentrations. That Department also published revised technical guidance documents relating to the building regulations which incorporate requirements for radon preventative measures to be undertaken in the construction of new houses from 1 July 1998. More elaborate measures are specified for new houses in areas identified as high radon areas in the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's National Radon Survey. The building regulations also require those involved in the design and construction of new buildings to exercise reasonable caution to avoid danger to health and safety caused by dangerous substances, which would include radon, found on or in the ground to be covered by a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland operates an advice service on radon and <Col N="512" /> can be contacted on freefone radon 1 800 300 600 by anyone seeking information on radon.</P>
    <P>I am preparing legislation to give effect to an EU directive on basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. The legislation, applies to all work activities affected by radiation exposure including workplaces where radon is a problem. This legislation will take effect on 13 May next.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is also aware, the Minister for Education and Science commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to carry out a survey of radon levels in all primary and post primary schools. This survey is being carried out in three phases. The first phase has been completed and the results were recently announced by the institute. Arising from the first phase of the survey, the Department of Education and Science is arranging for a radon remediation programme to be drawn up with priority being given to those cases of greatest need. The cost of the radon remediation is being met by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the member states, the European Commission is finalising the draft guidelines on Leader+, consequent on the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament. Further consultation is taking place with member states and this should open the way to early approval of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. The Commission will then have to consider the programme over a number of months, prior to approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the National Development <Col N="514" /> plan. As with other measures provided for in the National Development Plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>
    <P>In this context, it may be possible to progress the mainstream LEADER measure which will apply nationwide at a more rapid rate then Leader+ will allow. I am examining this possibility. In the meantime, I have allocated funding to Comhar Leader na hEireann <i>inter alia</i> to ensure that existing groups are fully familiar with the administrative requirements in regard to mandatory financial reporting of the conclusion of Leader II projects.</P>

      <P>I have established a steering group to investigate proposals for alleviation flooding problems in the south Galway area. A scheme to relieve flooding problems in the Tarmon area of south Galway is one peripheral project which was identified in the major south Galway flood study final report and has been listed by local interests for further consideration by the steering group. The downstream impacts of any flood relief proposals will have to be thoroughly assessed before any scheme(s) could be advanced for implementation. The concerns of the landowners in the Fergus River catchment have already been expressed to the secretary of the steering group and will be considered by the group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of bed closures and resulting bed days lost in 1999 are set out in the table attached. It should be noted that, for the purposes of accurate comparison, the figures exclude closures which occurred as a result of the nurses strike.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, each health board is obliged to produce an annual service plan for the year on the basis of the financial determination notified to them. This requirement is also applied to voluntary hospitals on an administrative basis. These service plans are agreed with my Department at the beginning of each year. Responsibility for delivering the plans rests with management in each agency. As part of the process of delivering service plans activity in the acute hospital sector is planned by agencies over a twelve month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available.</P>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level. In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1998 was 809,099. At out-patient level, the figures show that 1,960,126 attendances were recorded in that period. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of 3% over 1997 levels. This upward trend in overall activity continued in the first ten months of 1999. Overall discharges, in-patient and day case, were up 2.47% over the same period in 1998, which includes an increase in day cases of 9.87%. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas. In recent times it has also been necessary to close beds, particularly in the Dublin hospitals, due to difficulties recruiting appropriately qualified staff. Within this overall context, I will be asking agencies this year to explore whatever means are available to them to use their overall resources more flexibly in order to achieve reductions in waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>On 16 June 1998 my Department requested disclosure of information from tobacco companies under section 5 of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 on the constituents of tobacco products and of the amount of such constituents used in all the brands of tobacco products manufactured or imported. Several reminders were sent to the companies. Officials met the director of the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee on 13 August and on 30 November 1998. On 22 December 1998 a submission was made by a solicitor on behalf of the ITMAC companies. It was pointed out by the industry representative that there were omissions <Col N="520" /> in the data supplied. The industry failed to rectify the omissions for some time.</P>
      <P>The quality of the data supplied and the manner in which it was  aggregated meant that the information was of no material use from a public health perspective. This fact was brought to the companies attention at a meeting on 13 October 1999. Since that meeting further disclosures have been made. In particular one company Gallahers have now provided information in a satisfactory format and my officials have been assured at a meeting on 8 February with the director of ITMAC that the other companies intend to provide the same level of disclosure shortly.</P>

      <P>The offer made by Gallahers on 24 November 1999 to provide representatives of my Department with a presentation concerning the use of constituents in cigarettes has not been taken up by my Department. This was a time when the company had not yet supplied in a meaningful format the information requested from it on constituents in their tobacco products.</P>
      <P>In a letter of 13 January to the director of the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee, which represents Gallahers, Players and Carrolls, it was made clear to the industry that the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 requires each manufacturer to supply a list of ingredients in their products when so requested. Furthermore, it was pointed out that supplying information by broad categorisations of ingredients does not provide any meaningful information.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned there was no misunderstanding on what information was being sought from the company on the constituents used in their tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Gallahers submitted to my Department on 4 February the information on constituents in their tobacco products in the format originally sought from the company.</P>

      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. The primary aim of the drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To benefit under the drug payment scheme a patient must be registered with a health board and such registration recorded on the general medical services, payments, board patient masterfile. A unique identifier was required for the scheme which would also serve to link families together for the purposes of the £42 monthly threshold and which would provide a single data base which did not allow for duplication. As a person's personal public service, RSI, number is already a unique identifier it was decided to adopt the RSI Number as the unique identifier for the drug payment scheme. RSI numbers are <Col N="522" /> required for valid registration. A national &ldquo;mail shot&rdquo; to every household was carried out in mid 1999 about the drug payment scheme requesting individuals and heads of families to register under the scheme as early as possible to reap the benefits of the scheme. To date approximately 600,000 persons have registered. It was agreed with representatives of community pharmacists that patients who had not registered for the scheme and so could have been liable for any substantial pharmacy bills would have the facility to complete an application for registration at the time when prescriptions were being dispensed and thereby be allowed to cap their expenditure at £42 as provided for under the scheme. As indicated earlier a person's RSI number, being a unique identifier, is required for the completion of an application for registration. This method of patient registration was introduced and has been continued at the request of community pharmacy representatives.</P>

      <P>There is no licence required for the operation of a community pharmacy. Any person or company may open and operate a pharmacy in compliance with the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977. The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board may grant a contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. The purpose of the regulations is to bring about a more even geographic distribution of community pharmacies based on public health need, to enable the provision of the quality service required by the new contract also introduced in 1996 and to bring Ireland's provisions in regard <Col N="523" /> to the grant of community pharmacy contracts into line with that obtaining in other EU member states. Prior to the introduction of the regulations, Ireland, unlike other EU member states, was the only country which did not have some form of control on the grant of community pharmacy contracts.</P>

    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has overall responsibility for advising on and enforcing health and safety legislation and regulations. <Col N="524" /> Health agencies, as with all other employers, have the responsibility for ensuring workplace health and safety.</P>
    <P>Health agencies need to be aware of the importance of their responsibilities under health and safety legislation. My Department has met the Health and Safety Authority and it is currently in the process of forging strategic alliances with the country's eight health boards to promote their common objectives in the area of workplace health and safety. The Health and Safety Authority will work with health agencies to identify and prioritise the principal factors affecting safety and health in the health sector and encourage and support the development of good practices.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has established an advisory committee on the health services sector under section 17 of the Health Safety and Welfare Act, 1989. The committee will identify and prioritise the principal factors affecting health and safety in the health sector, having regard to the previous advisory committee report of 1992 and report to the authority its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The question of health and safety provisions is essentially one for the individual agencies to deal with on a day to day basis within their annual determination, service planning process and legal requirements under the health and safety acts. Additional funding available to me for health and safety initiatives for distribution to health agencies is limited and is provided to supplement initiatives at local level particularly those highlighted by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>The Deputy refers to the following extract from Labour Court Recommendation No. 16330:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Pay of Promotional Grade</i>On this issue the specially appointed Chairman to the talks has recommended that any discussions in relation to this area should be dealt with in a post Partnership 2000 setting. Consideration at that stage might include performance-related pay proposals.</P>
      <P>In return for this it was agreed that those in Management posts would receive a £1,000 lump sum.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Government accepted this finding, together with all other findings of the Labour Court in relation to nurses' pay, and this position still stands. The lump sum payment was sanctioned for payment in November 1999.</P>
      <P>The latest partnership agreement, Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, negotiated between Government and the social partners, provides scope for addressing the pay issues of nurses in promotional grades and all nurses.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that the traditional approach to pay reviews in the public service, based on analogues and relativities, has given rise to serious difficulties in the past, not least in the context of the nurses' pay disputes in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Government and social partners have agreed that an alternative approach grounded in a coherent and broadly-based comparison with jobs and pay rates across the economy is required. Consequently, it has been agreed that a public service benchmarking body will be established to examine this issue over the life of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Traditional or historical relativities between groups in a sector would not prevent the benchmarking body from recommending what it considers are appropriate pay rates on the basis of existing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Assuming ratification of the programme, the pay of nurses in promotional grades will be dealt with in this context. This approach is wholly consistent with LCR No. 16330.</P>

      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1995 prohibit smoking on all public service vehicles owned or operated by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath. Smoking is prohibited on privately owned transport vehicles used by the public which have a seating capacity for eight persons or more and which are engaged in the transport of persons for financial reward and in taxis and hackney cabs. Smoking is also prohibited on the DART and Arrow train sys<Col N="528" /> tems operated by Iarnród Éireann. On mainline trains and aircraft and passenger ferries smoking is prohibited in at least two-thirds of the seating area.</P>
      <P>The tobacco free policy group has completed a fundamental review on all aspects of health and tobacco including environmental controls on smoking in public facilities. When the group reports to me with its recommendations I will further consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1992 non-consultant hospital doctors, public health doctors, dentists employed by health boards and some other small groups of salaried doctors have been covered by a group medical indemnity scheme. The scheme was originally conceived as a measure to deal with industrial relations unrest among NCHDs who were dissatisfied with the then existing reimbursement scheme. On the basis that these groups are salaried doctors and dentists with little or no private practice it was decided to remove from them the obligation to hold individual indemnity cover and to devise a group scheme to purchase cover for them.</P>
      <P>The medical indemnity scheme was never intended to replicate the indemnity cover being provided by the medical defence organisations. Rather, it provides indemnity for the financial consequences of negligence arising from work undertaken as part of the doctor-dentists' activities in a post approved by the Department of Health and Children in the public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical indemnity scheme does not provide cover for representation before the fitness to practise committee of the Medical Council. It may, in certain circumstances, provide representation in other disciplinary proceedings. The Department is strongly of the view that an employer would not be put in the position of paying for services such as this. It would not be in the interests of hospitals or doctors that they should do so as, in certain circumstances, the hospital may be the body initiating a complaint against a doctor. It is in the doctor's own interest that he or she has a source of independent professional advice and representation. NCHDs should also be aware that they expose themselves <Col N="530" /> to risk when they diagnose, treat or prescribe for a relative or friend. They need to provide themselves with appropriate cover for this area of practice.</P>
    <P>In 1992 both the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation emphasised the importance of NCHDs and others covered by the scheme taking out supplementary cover for those aspects of their professional lives not covered by the scheme. This is available from the Medical Defence Union, Medical Protection Society and St. Paul.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres in County Kildare is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Health Board. I have been advised by that board that it entered into a contract last year with a local general practitioner to lease space in her practice premises and that it now provides dental, public health nursing, community welfare and chiropody services from there. The arrangement permitted the Eastern Health Board to transfer these services from unsatisfactory premises and has been working very satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The board has also advised me that proposals for a new health centre in Kilcock are also included in its capital priorities. It sees Kilcock developing in the future as a large town which will require a substantial investment in a health care facility to meet the needs of the increased population.</P>

    <P>As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question.

    <P>The report contains a wide range of recommendations on all aspects of child health services, including the issue of screening for hearing defects. In so far as the assessment of hearing defects is concerned, recommendations cover issues such as: the need for a well-organised audiology service; consideration to be given to the introduction of universal neonatal screening on a pilot basis; retention of the existing sweep of hearing of school children on the basis that all children at age five-six years are tested; availability of procedural guidelines for hearing tests in all location; training in audiology for all staff involved in screening and regular evaluation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental care is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and have phased out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools. Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach. The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
      <P>The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check &ndash; ups, treatment etc. is provided as necessary. An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
      <P>Dental services have also been extended to children who have left national school up to age 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children at primary school level.</P>

    <P>There was a highly successful outcome to last year's competitions for training places on the nursing registration-diploma programmes. A total of 1,215 training places were filled: 812 in general, 254 in psychiatric and 149 in mental handicap nursing which proves that there continues to be considerable interest among young people and others in nursing as a career. Funding of £360,000 has been provided for both national and local recruitment campaigns in advance of this year's competition.</P>
    <P>This year an additional 300 places nationally are being provided. Overall, some 1,500 places on the general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing diploma programmes will be available. This is being done in response to the evident nursing shortage, and honours a commitment given to the Alliance of Nursing Unions as part of the settlement of the nurses' pay dispute. The development of a new nurse education facility in Castlebar, the re-designation of the Southern Health Board School of General Nursing in Tralee General Hospital and the re-activation of the North Eastern Health Board Regional School of Psychiatric Nursing is a central component to the Government's overall strategy for ensuring that this commitment is delivered upon.</P>

      <P>The arrangements announced by the Government in relation to ensuring a large increase in Dublin taxi numbers provide that one additional taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence will be offered to each individual who held a taxi licence in the Dublin taximeter area at the end of 1999, as well as 500 further licences to be granted to applicants under the current points assessment system. Regulations made on 13 January 2000 established an implementation <Col N="538" /> process for these measures and applications have subsequently invited by Dublin Corporation from every person who held, or was entitled to hold, a taxi licence in Dublin as at 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for the making of an offer to grant a wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each licence holder who expresses a preference for the grant of such a licence and who complies with the requirements of the regulations. All remaining licences, including those to be offered to applicants under the current points assessment system, are to be allocated in accordance with a scheme to be finalised.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Dublin Corporation that, between the announcement of the Government decision on 30 November 1999 and 31 December 1999, 53 taxi licences were transferred to new licence holders. The corporation has also advised that over 2,600 applications for an additional taxi licence under the regulations have been received. The number of taxi licence holders who drive their own car is not known; however, all applicants who comply with the provisions of the regulations and the scheme will be offered licences.</P>
      <P>The regulations necessarily deal with persons who hold, or are entitled to hold, Dublin taxi licences in accordance with previous regulatory requirements. It would not be feasible, in this context, to take account of other private arrangements made by individuals in relation to particular licences.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study except for recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension where an age limit of 18 years applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further improvements to the scheme will be <Col N="539" /> introduced from September 2000. From that date it will be extended to recipients of invalidity pension, unemployability supplement and persons previously in receipt of carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Lone parents who are under 21 years of age and not therefore entitled to the back to education allowance may, however, continue to receive their one-parent family payment while pursuing a course of education. They can also avail of employment and have earnings of up to £115.38 a week without their rate of allowance being affected. Furthermore where an entitlement to a higher education grant exists any income from this is not taken into account. I do not see any justification therefore for a reduction in the qualifying age for persons in this category bearing these facts and the nature of the scheme in mind.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assist<Col N="540" /> ance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for this scheme in my Department's estimates for 2000.</P>
    <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50% to 90% of the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
    <P>I propose to have advertised the scheme in both the national and provincial press by mid-March, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme &ndash; SWA.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical advisor, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependants.</P>
      <P>The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. The various types of prescribed diets are grouped into two categories, one comprising lower cost diets and the other comprising higher cost diets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of calculating the rate of diet supplement payable, the lower cost diets were deemed to cost £27 per week and the higher cost diets were deemed to cost £35 per week. In the case of single people, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one third of their income is spent on food. Where the applicant is one of a couple, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one sixth of the couple's <Col N="541" /> joint income is spent on the diet supplement applicant's food.</P>
    <P>In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £27 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £35 less one third of the applicant's income &ndash; one sixth in the case of a couple. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of £8 per week for a higher cost diet and £5 per week for a lower cost diet. In the case of persons with dependent children the child dependants' allowance is not assessed.</P>
    <P>The SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and a fundamental examination of the diet supplement will be undertaken in this context.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department provides assistance towards the cost of dental, optical and audiology services to people who satisfy certain statutory PRSI conditions, and to their dependent spouses. The scheme is a contributory social insurance scheme and workers paying contributions at classes A, E, H and P and their dependent spouses are insured for these benefits. The total thus covered for these benefits is 1.2 million, comprising some 900,000 insured persons and an estimated 300,000 dependent spouses.</P>
      <P>Insured persons who satisfy the relevant contribution conditions and their dependent spouses are entitled to a free sight test every two years. In addition, where there is a clinical necessity for a more frequent sight test and this is confirmed by the optician, this will be covered free of charge under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Some 183,000 people benefited under the optical scheme in 1999, comprising 147,000 insured persons and 36,000 spouses. Eye tests were carried out in 169,000 cases, the balance of the claims involving repairs to appliances.</P>

      <P>At second level an additional 1,000 teaching posts will be created in the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that an expert group has been established to examine allocation and redeployment issues. Pending the outcome of the deliberations of the group, no decision has been taken on the actual allocation of the additional posts.</P>
      <P>At primary level, 200 additional posts will be created primarily to tackle educational disadvantage. In addition, the number of posts arising from the demographic dividend is under examination and discussion with the education partners at present. Decisions on the manner in which these posts will be allocated in the 2000-01 school year will be taken following these discussions. The Deputy will be aware also that under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an additional 900 primary teachers will be appointed in the course of the next few years.</P>
      <P>In relation to extra resource teaching posts, the Deputy will be aware that this Government has taken a series of important measures to assist children with disabilities in the education system.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, my Department announced a major initiative for integrated education for children with special needs. This initiative provided the first ever automatic supports for many children with disabilities. The measures included the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs.</P>
      <P>Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers to support children with special needs in the primary system. Additional resource teachers will be allocated as required to meet assessed needs.</P>

      <P>At second level, subject specialisation, retirement patterns and limited redeployment capacity effectively ensure that there is no demographic dividend at this level.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools which have on their staff over-quota permanent teachers, a retention ratio of 18:1 will be applied. The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might have been placed on the redeployment panel. At primary level the number of posts arising from the demographic dividend is under examination and discussion with the education partners at present.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, of course, that an additional 200 posts will be created at primary level next year, primarily to tackle educational disadvantage.

      <P>In 1998 my Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to carry out a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools in the country. The survey, which is being conducted in three phases, involves recording the concentration of radon gas present in a school over an academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> The RPII recently issued results to the schools that participated in the first phase of the survey. This phase covered schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I have directed my Department to take immediate steps to appoint consultants to devise remediation programmes for schools showing levels in excess of the national reference level, with priority being given to the cases of greatest need.</P>
    <P>A total of 175 schools, spread across these counties, showed radon levels in excess of the national reference level with 13 schools showing levels that require immediate mitigation. A consultant has already been engaged to advise in relation to this task. Five schools have been inspected by the consultant who is preparing a remediation programme for each. This is expected to be ready shortly. The remaining eight of these 13 schools will be inspected by the consultant in early March.</P>
    <P>Remediation programmes for the remaining less-affected schools will be drawn up, with <Col N="556" /> priority being given to the areas of greatest need, following the appointment of a consultant. It is anticipated that an expert will be appointed in the near future.</P>
    <P>All schools have received information on radon and will be kept informed of new developments. My Department will meet the cost of mitigation.</P>
