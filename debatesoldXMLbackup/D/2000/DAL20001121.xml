      <P>On 27 July the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I attended the second plenary meeting of the social partners. The purpose of the meeting was to review implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Presentations were given on each of the operational frameworks and, as is clear from the first and second progress reports, which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library, an impressive amount of progress has been made during the first seven months of the agreement. The Government is firmly committed to maintaining this level of momentum in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>At the plenary meeting in July, I undertook that we would engage in a process of consultation with the social partners on the budget. The first meeting took place on Friday, 22 September, and a number of further meetings have been held. The Government will consider very carefully all proposals and priorities put forward. This will be done by reference to their cost, their likely benefits, their implications for the achievement of the objectives of the PPF and their probable impact on behaviour and expectations, particularly from the perspective of minimising the effects of inflation. The Government has not ruled out any options and I believe that sensible choices can be made, taking into account the views of the social partners and the objective economic analysis which must underpin any budgetary strategy.</P>
      <P>Separately, and in accordance with the terms of the PPF, a meeting was held on 17 October at the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to consider the problems caused by current inflationary pressures. Under the procedures in question, a process of discussion between the parties to the pay agreement was initiated. I am satisfied that these are being undertaken in a constructive spirit, although it is too early to say what the outcome will be. The parties, however, share a commitment to the continuation of the social partnership model and, in particular, to the full implementation of the PPF.</P>
      <P>In the light of the progress made, I have invited the parties to continue with the process of discussion with a view to achieving a balanced outcome. In that regard, the decision last week by the ICTU executive to continue with those discussions is both welcome and encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> In my remarks at the IBEC executive meeting on 13 September, I placed particular emphasis on social partnership as a problem-solving process. It has enabled many pressures and constraints to be overcome in the past, especially in reducing unemployment, generating jobs and deepening competitiveness. Similarly, social partnership can and should be used in the future to help us address new challenges in the most effective way possible, particularly with regard to housing and public transport. I covered similar themes in my address to the Confederation of British Industry in Birmingham on 5 November &ndash; a copy of my speech is available in the Oireachtas Library. This was the sole engagement undertaken by me during my visit. In my address, I placed particular emphasis on the economic and social changes which have taken place over the past decade and I set them in the context of the growing opportunities for Irish and British businesses arising from the ever-deepening relationship between our two countries. At my meeting with the ICMSA during the summer, we had a comprehensive exchange of views on the overall economic situation and, of course, on those issues of particular concern to the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>On the issue of widening representation in the social partnership process, the practice is well established now that any organisation wishing to become part of the process should secure the agreement of the appropriate social partner pillar. In the event of a positive response, the Government would consider such applications sympathetically, taking due account of such factors as continuance of a fair balance in representation as between the four pillars. It is my understanding that no environmental organisation has yet sought formal agreement for inclusion under the appropriate pillar &ndash; in this case, the community and voluntary pillar. Such interests, however, are already represented in the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the budget is not being drawn up primarily by the Minister for Finance but is being negotiated with the social partners and that the budget presented in the House will be the result of negotiation with very important interests outside the House, namely, the social partners, without any input from this House? Will he agree that this is the case given that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has set budget day as the day it will decide whether to continue with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years, and this year is no exception, the social partners have always made it clear that it is not their wish to take away from the role of the Executive other than to do what everybody else does, which is to put forward their views. There is a social welfare forum where all the interest groups come together to put their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the social partnership process the social <Col N="465" /> partners can at any time request the chairman of the central review committee to raise issues that create difficulties and this year, because the inflationary figures are much higher than they were when we negotiated the PPF, that measure was used. Since September a number of discussions took place on how we can reduce the impact of inflationary pressures on the economy. The successes and commitments outlined in the programme have been pulled back to an extent because of inflationary pressures and that is being examined in the context of making sure account is taken of that. Separate from that, the ICTU made its normal budgetary submission to the Minister last week or the week before and it has also made those points in the public domain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister for Finance is being politically chaperoned on this budget because of the unnecessary errors he made the last time and that the Government is using the social partners as a form of political proofing of the Minister's budget in a fashion that goes against the tradition whereby this House is the first to hear of his proposals under the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that certainly is not true. The same conventions will take place this year as every other year and these discussions will continue. I have been around, as has the Deputy, for many budgets and I assure him there is no change in that regard. However, the social partners and other organisations put a great deal of effort into making budget submissions, more so than they did in the early part of the last decade, and that is a major process. I assure the Deputy it does not take from the traditional position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that last year's budget was both inflationary and socially divisive, bringing us to the point where the pay component of the current social partnership agreement is seriously at risk, will the Taoiseach indicate that the Government's priority is to ensure the agreement stays intact and that it regards the budget and its contents in respect of income tax as central to ensuring the agreement remains intact? Will he give an assurance that the utterances he made in New York and elsewhere in regard to the focus of attention on the low paid will be reflected in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, the answer is yes. The Government is very conscious of the pressures on incomes as a result of recent inflation and we must be vigilant in avoiding a wage driven inflationary spiral and the domino effect across different sectors if we are to maintain our traditional relativities and competitiveness. For that reason, in the budget we must take account of social partnership and all the benefits it has for the economy and individuals. The power to the individual derives from the fact that it keeps Ireland competitive and maintains <Col N="466" /> high economic growth, activity and employment. That is a central theme. The other demands, issues and the commitments in the partnership programme must also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Is he familiar with the report produced by the National Economic and Social Forum in respect of the impact of one of the measures of last year's budget, to whit the infamous individualisation proposals, where the analysis done by the NESF showed that 80% of resources went to the top 20% of earners and that, if that policy were maintained, as was threatened by the Minister last year, the effect this year would be that 98% of resources would go to the top 20% of earners? Does the Taoiseach see the maintenance of individualisation as being in accordance with the overall objective of ensuring that social partnership in general and this agreement in particular is maintained and continues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many balances must be achieved. Low pay is a very important one, and fairness in how people receive their income, what taxes they pay on those incomes, two income earners and one income earners are all, in their own way, priorities for that category. As always in the budget, the Minister for Finance must use in a fair way whatever resources exist to give as much equity as he possibly can. It is hoped that those issues will be addressed successfully again in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard as a fair outcome the outturn of the impact of individualisation last year, where 80% of resources was focused on 20% of top earners, whatever about the ideological underpinning which informed it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I have repeatedly said that we must be conscious that the problems of our tax system are probably on the lower end. Although I am aware of the report he mentioned, I am sure he is equally aware of the international reports and reports by some of our own bodies which have shown that we do more for the low paid than any other countries which are members of the European Union. That is not to say we have done enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that social partnership is facing a crisis because the inflation rate upon which it was negotiated by Government was 3% and the actual inflation rate is now around 7%, and that the people who negotiated those levels of pay increase in the public sector in particular are feeling very badly because, in the private sector, the terms of the agreement are being ignored by many employers who pay well over the terms of the PPF?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a concern in the public sector with the position of low paid workers where, for example, clerical officers have in recent years seen their pay rates increase <Col N="467" /> by about 109% after tax whereas Secretaries-General of Departments have seen their pay rates increase by more than 200% after tax, and that there is a demand now not just for compensation for inflation, which is well ahead of the Government's predictions which were the basis of the original agreement, but also for the introduction of an element into pay of a minimum lump sum which would be of guaranteed equal benefit to the low paid rather than simple percentage increases which tend to disproportionately benefit the better paid and which have been aggravated by a tax policy from the Government which has been inordinately skewed in favour of the better off?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those in the social partnership process who negotiated the agreement did so on the best figures available at that time. It is shown that inflationary figures have meant there has effectively been a cutback in that to which they would have believed they were entitled. That is the issue that must be addressed and it is on that that negotiations are centring.</P>
      <P>People in many grades throughout the public sector will make their cases to the new benchmarking body on precisely the point made by Deputy Bruton because they believe the old relativities and analogues, which have not served us well, allow them to put forward and construct cases where they believe they will do better. That is what the benchmarking body will do. It commenced its work yesterday and people are entitled to put forward their scales. I think they will do so on the basis of what the Deputy has said.</P>
      <P>The other part of the question is that we have to try to moderate inflation. At the turn of the year we have to see how some of the figures will fall out. We cannot resolve many of the international issues, including the euro and oil prices, but I hope they will become a bit better than they have been during the year. We can help to moderate inflation by what we do on tax, expenditure and programmes under our fiscal control. That is the challenge we will have to face, right into 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the benchmarking body is really beside the point because it will not report for two years? People, however, are facing price increases in the shops and have problems with their budgets now. They see people in the private sector &ndash; builders workers, for example &ndash; getting increases of up to 40%, yet they are being asked to accept tiny increases. The position is particularly severe in the clerical grades of the Civil Service where staff cannot be recruited because the pay levels are so low. For example, new staff cannot be recruited by Deputies whose secretaries retire, because the pay levels are so low. What will the Taoiseach do about that in the short term, instead of kicking it to some benchmarking body that will not issue a report for two years?</P>

      <P>On 1 October, an increase of 8.5% was given to our clerical staff. As I have already said, the discussions involving public sector unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, within the social partnership, are examining precisely where they fell short on inflation and in what way that can be made up. That is the short-term aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the gap between rich and poor has been growing, and continues to grow, under the stewardship of Government policies? What has been said to employers regarding the view of ICTU negotiators who say the Government alone cannot compensate for inflationary pressures on wages and salaries? On a related but different matter, can the Taoiseach's comments about environmental bodies be reconsidered? Their involvement in the terms of reference of the NESF is hardly adequate given the enormous financial, social and environmental challenges currently facing this country, among many others, in The Hague. Would that provoke the Taoiseach to review the seriousness with which the Government takes the issues being highlighted by the environmental NGOs? Would the Taoiseach agree that competitiveness will be seriously undermined unless we take into consideration the challenges of being far less dependent on fossil fuels and having a greater self reliance in energy and energy saving? Is that part of his brief for competitiveness in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, with the widening representation in the social partnership process, the system is now well established whereby if the appropriate pillar agrees then the Government tends to sympathetically take account of the factors, once they do not disturb the balance. If particular groups wish to come into the process, the system has been there for <Col N="469" /> almost a decade to allow them to follow it. I said that no such group had brought forward an application but other groups involved in the National Economic and Social Forum were putting forward these cases.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's final point, many groups have made pre-budget submissions on the issues being addressed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in The Hague. I am sure the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will address the conclusions reached at what I accept is a very important conference. Let us see what arises from it.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's earlier question, the strength of the partnership process has been its ability to solve problems. Inflation has, effectively, doubled this year. This has created a problem. While it presents a real challenge, it is not insurmountable. Between tax breaks and salary increases, people expected to see their incomes increase by 14%. This has probably been reduced to 9%, which, admittedly, is not as high as expected. This is being addressed. It has an effect in the private sector. Deputy Bruton is correct that the many employers in the private sector who can afford to do so have granted additional increases, but this does not apply across the board. There are categories, therefore, which are of the view that this is unreasonable. We have to try to resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will accept that an extra 300,000 people are at work. This has created extra resources. Many of the arguments that we used to have a decade ago about the poverty trap have long since been eliminated. While those dependent on social welfare are still in difficulty, this is not true of society as a whole. It behoves us to help them by removing the difficulties. This is being done by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs by way of increases in recent Social Welfare Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 12 in my name relates to an additional pillar to social partnership for the environmental sector. The Taoiseach intimated that this has not happened because NGOs have not made a formal application. He has missed the point. If we are to proceed with sustainable development and honour, rather than breach, a series of EU directives on the environment, we need to place the principles of sustainability at the centre of the political agenda and economic planning and not leave it to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Given that we have failed totally to decouple economic <Col N="470" /> growth and environmental degradation, we are in breach of greenhouse gas emission limits and water quality is disimproving, will the Taoiseach, as a matter of leadership and policy at central level, consider altering the structure of the partnership framework to provide for an additional pillar for the environmental sector to ensure economic growth will not continue at the expense of the environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy assumes that the NESC, the NESF and the other social partners ignore the issue, but they do not. It is an unfair assumption. The NESC has probably done more work in this area than anybody else, identifying ways by which we can keep sustainable development at the core of economic policy development. It is its strategy which underpins for this decade, as it did for the past decade successfully, social partnership. I do not accept the Deputy's argument that no one involved in social partnership, be it the NESC, the NESF or anybody else, has had an input. A large number of Members have made the case for it.</P>
      <P>With regard to a separate pillar, that is a bigger issue which would need to be examined. It is not a case that has been strongly put. The case that sustainable development should be a key part of our policy is being put but not that it should be put forward as a separate pillar.</P>

      <P>With regard to Questions Nos. 14 and 15 concerning the Taoiseach's remarks to the Confederation of British Industry, does the Taoiseach have reason to believe that the attitude of the CBI has changed considerably in respect of whether Britain will make an earlier or later entry into the euro? What was his assessment, following the informal discussions that would have taken place in the environs of that conference, as to what type of timetable is envisaged by our partners next door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving a fair assessment of the conference, first it must be pointed out that it is a very heated debate. It looks as if there is no longer an in-between position. Two years ago there was a debate in which a case was put forward by both sides, but that is not the situation now. The lines are drawn now between the arguments for and against. The CBI, by a sizeable majority &ndash; a margin of seven to one according to the survey I was shown at the conference &ndash; is effectively against actively pursuing the issue. It is now off its list of issues.</P>
      <P>My conclusion, after listening to a number of senior people on the night whose views were strongly held, is that it is not an agenda item until well into the next British Government's term of office. I believe CBI will take the view that it will be a matter for the then British Government. It is not something the CBI will actively pursue over the next period.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's broad conclusion. If we are facing a period of up to five years before sterling is in the single currency, if that is to happen, has the Government, in the context of social partnership, examined the potential inflationary consequences a high value sterling will have on the domestic market over a period of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are such examinations &ndash; it might be too strong to describe them as studies. I raised that issue following the CBI conference. There are five or six areas which need to be examined. They include the increase in oil prices, the interest rates of the ECB and how they will pan out in the medium term, the continued decline in the euro's exchange rate, the increase in duties of one type or other not just here but elsewhere and the price pressures in the domestic economy, whether they are housing, alcohol, services or whatever. We must also consider the headline inflation rate within the Union over the next period. I have talked to the Minister for Finance about this and I am aware that ECOFIN is carrying out some surveys but we, too, must look at this issue. I thought until recently that there was a strong prospect of the UK joining the euro in the early part of 2002, but that is not my view now.</P>

      <P>In reply to a previous question from Deputy Quinn, the Taoiseach confirmed that the forthcoming budget is an essential plank in the social partnership structure. Will the Taoiseach confirm that, following last Saturday's mini summit at Government Buildings, all Ministers will this year be aware of tax changes in the budget, unlike last year when only the triumvirate was aware of them? Will the Taoiseach tell the House what role the tax strategy group has in framing this year's budget, particularly in terms of idiot proofing it against the appalling mess that was made last year?</P>

      <P>With regard to the questions on social partnership, will the Taoiseach indicate in the meetings with the social partners if consideration has been given at any level to a revision of the general pay terms of the PPF? </P>
      <P>With regard to the housing forum established under the partnership agreement, how often has it met? When can we expect a report and recommendations from it on how to deal with the housing crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the pay issue, the case put forward by the trade union element of the social partners is that there should be compensation in one form or another for what has been lost by way of inflationary pressure. That is the substance of its case. Regardless of whether that is done by way of tax or pay measures or some other element, that is the basis on which the trade union movement considers compensation should be awarded. It reached agreement on one basis and given that did not happen, it put forward that case, and is entitled to do so, as that is provided in the rules of the Central Review Committee. That is what has been debated since 22 September and we have to come to a conclusion on that fairly shortly.</P>
      <P>The housing forum has had a number of meetings, although I cannot tell the Deputy the precise number. A number of its proposals have been before the Cabinet or have been discussed by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. The report that will lead to the introduction of the Bill the Deputy has raised regularly has been presented to the housing forum. The Bill will be drafted as quickly as possible based at the recommendations of the housing forum and others.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that if a revision of the pay terms is firmly on the table from congress, if it has set a deadline for deciding whether it will continue with the PPF on the same day as budget day and if a pay concession is made by the Government that has implications for the budget for 2001? Surely the fundamental financial numbers of this budget are currently being negotiated by the Central Review Committee with the social partners? How could the issue of pay be resolved in the context of the budget without money? If money is to be provided, will it be provided in the budget and, if not and it is to be a matter of subsequent negotiation, will a budget presented here on budget day not be the definitive but a provisional budget? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The social partners have made their case. The interim report that I issued about two weeks ago states that they believe there should be some compensation for what they have lost. That case has to be concluded. The social partners have not put a deadline on that process. They have stated that the process with the <Col N="473" /> Government should be completed as soon as possible, and I said the same as early as 22 September when the first meeting took place. I hope it will take place. The social partners have strongly emphasised, not a threat to social partnership but based on an assessment of what has happened in the branches all over the country, that they want to stay in the social partnership process and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. They want to continue to gain benefits from that in tax, pay, welfare, employment and all other aspects of the broad partnership agreement. However, they have correctly said that the basis for what they agreed in inflation has not happened and that, therefore, some form of compensation, in one form of other, must be taken into account, as I said to Deputy Gilmore. That is an entirely reasonable position for them to put and we must see if we can find a mechanism whereby this issue can be resolved. If that issue is resolved provision must be made for it. If it is not resolved we will have to see what happens but, as I said in my initial reply, it is too early to give a report on that other than to say that I have had numerous meetings with the leaders of the social partners &ndash; employers, trade unions, farmers and the community pillar &ndash; in recent months, the period covered by these questions, and they are all absolutely determined to find a resolution and to work through these difficulties so that the PPF continues. That is how we must find a resolution.</P>

      <P>In effect the Taoiseach has confirmed that the budget is being negotiated with the social partners.</P>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 1, is the Taoiseach aware that the position of the farming community has worsened substantially in recent weeks due to a fall in cattle prices from approximately 95p per pound to 82p per pound as a result of the BSE problems in France? In the context of the current discussions of the Central Review Committee, is the Government contemplating any action in view of the fact that that fall in price represents a huge income drop for a significant section of the community and for a significant social partner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of these difficulties. I have met representatives of the IFA and the ICMSA at regional and national levels in the past few weeks and there has been a sharp decline in prices directly as a result of the French situation. A 17-hour meeting of Agriculture Ministers which ended at 8 a.m. today looked at what more can be done in this area to restore confidence. Last week there was a very high kill &ndash; I believe there were 38,000 cattle killed &ndash; but the previous week, with the bad weather and the start of this difficulty, there was little or no killing. This week will be another difficult week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to try to move quickly on the conclusions of this morning's meeting. Ireland is still an area of low incidence and, although it was 1989 that the first BSE cattle were detected, we must be careful with this situation. There are still some <Col N="474" /> vital markets we must be careful about, such as Egypt, which receives 150,000 tons and is probably the biggest world market. From the report the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development gave me on this morning's meeting, the &ldquo;infer&rdquo; system &ndash; which I believe was invented by an Irishman &ndash; will be used for testing to bring the situation under control rapidly. I am concerned, however, that that will not start until&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know other schemes have been looked at, such as aids to private storage, where factories would kill and hold carcases. That is not a great resolution. Three issues are important in this regard, the first of which is the price which will be resolved only by confidence being restored in the market. Deputy Bruton will understand that because of other events that happened last year, which had nothing to do with Ireland, the meetings were difficult in that certain scores were being settled. That was not helpful to anyone. We have to resolve this issue but we have to work to restore confidence in the market.</P>
      <P>We must be careful and strong in regard to all our mechanisms. We have to protect what we have, and I am not referring only to the Egyptian market, although I am always conscious of that market because of its size and extent. Even though we have good credibility in this area, under the international veterinary group, it is something about which we can never be careful enough.</P>
      <P>We also have to continue to extend our market base because a vulnerability has been highlighted in that just when we think everything is going fine, prices can take a major dip because of something happening on the international stage. I will not try to defend that because it is serious, but we have to be careful on those three points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that this crisis has arisen because it transpired that France was not enforcing EU rules properly in regard to the separation of meat and bone meal to ensure that meat and bone meal from bovine animals was not fed back to bovine animals, and that the most elementary precautions that are being taken in Ireland, Britain and other countries were not taken in France? Is it not clear, therefore, that the system whereby it is left to national authorities to enforce EU rules in their own jurisdictions simply is not working, and that France is just one example of a number of delinquents as far as this is concerned? This matter needs to be taken up by the Taoiseach at EU level at the summit because there is no point in the European Union <Col N="475" /> giving assurances that food is safe if those rules are not being enforced in practice.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, while the outcome of last night's meeting was very good &ndash; the Minister is to be complimented on it because it is the right approach and a lot of things could have gone wrong last night &ndash; at the same time more BSE cases will be detected in the short term, the net effect of which will be a further fall in confidence in the beef market? The Taoiseach should realise, and I hope he does, that Irish farmers are facing a very serious crisis over the winter as far as incomes are concerned, to the extent that they depend on bovine animal sales to put bread and butter on the table for their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of statements were made and that debate exacerbated the lack of confidence surrounding the whole issue. I emphasise again that the rapid surveillance testing here and the fact that we do not allow any type of feed into the food chain for cattle, which has been intensified for what are called the casualty cattle over 13 months, should certainly help, but it is a confidence issue in the community and I am sure it will be discussed repeatedly in the next few weeks. At this stage, however, we have to do everything we can to restore confidence because in France the consumer market has effectively dissipated in a period of 15 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion. In this regard, the report of the steering group on the funding of second <Col N="476" /> level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. It is my intention that this report will continue to inform policy on school funding.</P>
      <P>While I intend to direct my energies to address the issues of equity and transparency of funding, I emphasise that my priority is the adequacy of funding levels for schools in the second level sector. I have already shown my commitment and determination in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September this year to £192 and I am particularly pleased to inform the House that I am increasing the <i>per capita</i> grant by £10 for the next school year. This will bring the capitation grant to £202, an increase of £25 per pupil per annum. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. In addition, and in recognition of the cashflow needs of schools, I am arranging to bring forward the payment of the next instalment of the <i>per capita</i> grant to next month.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further this progress.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply in which he recognises the inequality in the funding arrangements for second level schools. If we are supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally, why is the Minister not setting out clear proposals to end these inequalities? Is it not obvious that there are insufficient resources and facilities available to voluntary secondary schools and second level schools in general to implement, for example, the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister met the joint managerial body and does he understand the extent of its frustration at the way voluntary secondary schools are being strangled because of this iniquitous system? Does he propose to debate this issue with the committee on education and science or in the House arising from the clear recommendations in the report of the steering group on second level funding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to facilitate the committee on education and science if it wishes to debate this important issue. Resources are the key and that is why I introduced the new fund. <Col N="477" /> The Deputy will note that I introduced this measure in the course of the current year and I hope to build on it as I go forward.</P>
      <P>This issue is one of the main concerns of the joint managerial body with whom I held discussions about the report. This is an extensive report which highlights the fact that this issue cannot be approached in a simple manner because of the differences between schools. This is why, in addition to building up the fund, the capitation grant is seen as the principal means of improving the situation.</P>
      <P>I will continue with this approach and I accept the Deputy's general comments. These situations developed historically and we have to address them and provide as much equity and transparency as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the adequacy of funding. Why did £16 million remain unspent from his capital programme as outlined in the Book of Estimates published last week? When he receives his additional moneys on 6 December will he be in a position to end part of this iniquitous funding system? The voluntary secondary sector is being strangled resulting in a great deal of frustration and lowering of morale of people who wish to do a professional job but cannot do so because of the system. This also places pressure on communities to involve themselves in all kinds of fundraising for something which should be assisted to a greater extent by the State.</P>

      <P>I am approaching this issue on a number of fronts. I am trying to make the system simpler and more efficient. For example, I am endeavouring to simplify the way capital projects are progressed and to delegate more responsibility to the schools in question. Never before has so much capital been made available to schools. However, there are many problems to be overcome and we will continue to deal with them as urgently as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if supervision in secondary schools of lunch breaks, break time and so on is a voluntary commitment by teachers in schools; if any payment is involved in teachers' pay in recognition of this; the way in which he will introduce a proper system of supervision that will allow for school term to continue where closure might otherwise result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The professional role of a teacher encompasses the performance of teaching and non-teaching duties. There is a long tradition of teachers supervising students within the school environs during the normal school day. However, all teachers would not be required to undertake these duties on a daily basis. It is a matter for local management to agree these operational arrangements with their teachers. Teachers are not paid separately in respect of supervision.</P>
      <P>Prior to embarking on industrial action, the ASTI balloted its members to approve a range of measures which included the withdrawal of supervision at break time. The ASTI members' action in withdrawing from supervision and refusing to substitute for absent colleagues has had the direct result of schools not being able to operate and the cancellation of classes. In the circumstances I could not justify to taxpayers and particularly the parents of children the payment of £1.2 million per day to ASTI members while children are not being taught. I do not understand how people who cause schools to be closed to children could expect to be paid. I have notified the ASTI that payment will not be made for these days.</P>
      <P>I am most anxious to resolve the present difficulties with the ASTI. As I have consistently indicated, the solution to the current dispute lies in the well-established framework of social partnership and in particular within the framework of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We cannot and must not break the PPF.</P>
      <P>A major development in the PPF is the establishment of the public service benchmarking body which has been set up to undertake a fundamental examination of public service pay and jobs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. In reaching its recommendations, the benchmarking body will have regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff with the qualifications, skills and flexibility required to exercise their different responsibilities and the need to ensure equity between employees in the public service and the private sector. This benchmarking process provides a mechanism through which the ASTI can pursue its aspirations for a fundamental examination of the role of second level teachers and the level of pay it should attract. This is the route being pursued by its colleagues in the other teacher unions and the public service unions generally.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I am available at any time to meet the president and officials of the ASTI to find a way to ensure that the education of second level pupils is not further disrupted and that the serious concerns of parents are laid to rest as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that his threat to withhold payment to teachers who engage in work to rule, as many other workers <Col N="479" /> do, has only served to exacerbate an already very difficult situation? As things stand, it appears the Minister is going to follow through on this threat and the teachers are waiting to see the outcome and what their pay cheques will be on the next pay day.</P>
      <P>What consideration has the Minister given to the long-term damage this action is likely to cause to the goodwill which underpins our education system? Does he accept this matter is likely to end up in the courts and that if we reach a situation where what is, and what is not, within the terms of a teacher's contract is set down by the courts, a huge array of activities which enrich our education system, including all the extra curricular activities and the voluntary work teachers do, apart from supervision at break times, such as attending football meetings, taking injured children to hospital and calling to children's homes if they do not show up at school, will not be undertaken because of the damage that will be caused to the goodwill teachers already display through their voluntary efforts in this regard? Has the Minister considered the long-term damage that is likely to result from his action if this matter ends up in the courts, as it undoubtedly will?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not understand how teachers could expect me to pay them when they create a situation in which children are left outside. I do not see, in logical terms, how that could be expected. I have said what my decision, and that of the Government, is.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to build on the goodwill. I have made it very clear that I have a very high regard for the teachers and the work they do, but there is a system to which the teachers can apply to pursue their immediate interests. I am very concerned that teachers would be paid properly for the work they do but there is a Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and a benchmarking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised about benchmarking earlier in this dispute and they were to the effect that the benchmarking might not be urgent or immediate and might not deal with the issues involved. It should be very clear from yesterday that the benchmarking system is now very much up and running, is dealing with the issues in which the teachers are interested and is dealing with them as a matter of urgency, and that that can be achieved within the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the interests of everybody concerned. I appeal to the teachers to make use of the machinery that is there and to work with their colleagues in the public sector to resolve their dif<Col N="480" /> ferences as well as the differences which affect other workers in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the extra curricular activities such as football, etc., normally they are done by people who have an interest in that area. They are also done in the community, as Deputies will know, and people in the community also do voluntary work of that kind. These are issues which can be discussed. They are part of the whole package teachers wish to discuss at the moment and there is a means there for them to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is presiding over a situation where the 16,000 members of the ASTI are on strike and more than 20,000 members of the INTO are mandated to go on strike if the results they seek are not evident on 6 December. The Teachers Union of Ireland has sent out ballot papers for industrial action, despite being inside the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to be returned with a decision on 4 December. If these trends of morale among the teaching sector are converging, the Minister will be presiding over an unholy mess in our education system next spring.</P>
      <P>If the Minister values the work of teachers, as he has indicated here, what contact has he had with the ASTI since last Friday? Did he formally invite it to attend the benchmarking process and, if not, why not? His colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, or public chaos, is able to meet both sides in the transport dispute and set up Labour Court facilities for them to deal with their business. Why did the Minister not extend an invitation to the ASTI to attend the benchmarking process?</P>
      <P>Did the Minister's Department apply to the Department of Finance for a specific grant to operate supervision, outside the terms of the contract of teachers, by private contact or whatever? If that is the case, as I understand was recommended last July, is that not an inherent recognition that supervision is a voluntary activity by teachers?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister have any concept or understanding of just how difficult supervision in some large schools is, where pupils come from broken homes and a drink and drugs culture, where there is intimidation instead of supervision and it is extremely difficult and very intimidatory for many teachers to have to undertake this duty and have it branded as purely voluntary? They do this work because of their professional training and the Minister is not helping them to achieve the standards we all want them to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that the teachers were welcome to take part in the benchmarking process. Questions have been raised as to how they can come to the benchmarking process. Within the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, they can work on any of the processes. Within the ICTU, they can work on the processes. There are two aspects, or two levels, in the benchmarking process, one is the Government and the social partners, which are looking at over<Col N="481" /> all inflation and issues such as timing, and the other is the public services committee of the ICTU and the benchmarking body itself. That is what the Deputy saw in operation yesterday where the public services committee of the ICTU was working to resolve these issues. The INTO and the TUI were at that committee. Of course, they are strongly expressing their concerns but they are expressing them within the partnership and the public services committee of ICTU.</P>

Surely it is clear that the benchmarking body is dealing vigorously, effectively and urgently with the issues the teachers have raised.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current financial year expen<Col N="482" /> diture on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million. In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I also established an action group on access to third level education last September to advise on measures which would tackle under-representation by disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>As regards the future administration of the schemes, officials of my Department have been engaged with officials from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to possible options. Terms of reference for a detailed review of the administration of the schemes are currently being finalised between the two Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the <Col N="483" /> Finance Act, 1999. A survey by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in September 1999 to gauge the effect of the tax incentives indicated that 7,500 bed spaces were in various stages of planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that students all over the country have begun to protest about this matter. This is not the traditional type of protest where students take action on one day. It is a serious matter and students are most concerned about the inadequacy of the maintenance grant which currently stands at £1,775 or £49 a week.</P>
      <P>The cost of participation in third level education is approximately £5,000. The cost of private rented accommodation has increased by 94% since 1997-98, while the inflation index of the grant has increased by only 9%. This forces students to work long hours in part-time jobs to meet their financial requirements. This is bound to have an effect on the quality of degrees that students obtain as a consequence. How is it possible for a student who works up to 14 hours on Saturdays and Sundays to attend tutorials and lectures and to do proper reading and study? How can such students achieve the higher level degrees that are required and on which our international reputation is built?</P>
      <P>The Cromien report makes specific recommendations in respect of maintenance and third level grants. Does the Minister intend to act on those recommendations? Will he explain what he means by a disadvantaged student? Does he mean disadvantaged geographically or disadvantaged in terms of background or economic circumstances? The Minister mentioned a figure of 10,000 students. How was that computed? Does he intend to speed up the process of providing on-campus accommodation for students? Is he happy with what is already provided in terms of the weekly payments that must be made to meet demands in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to disadvantage, the estimate relates to the number of people involved in the scheme. These people came through the access officers and the existing system. It is an estimate of the number that would benefit from those increases.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future administration of the schemes, officials of my Department have been engaged with officials from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to possible options. Terms of reference for a detailed review of the administration of the schemes are currently being finalised between the two Departments. Action on this recommendation is already under way.</P>

    <P>With specific regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the <Col N="484" /> Finance Act, 1999.

      <P>Bus Éireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. The scheme utilises around 2,450 vehicles daily. Approximately 650 of these vehicles are supplied by Bus Éireann and the remainder by private contractors engaged by Bus Éireann. The question of the replacement of vehicles no longer considered suitable for school transport is a matter for Bus Éireann and the contractors.</P>
      <P>The age profile and quality of vehicle in the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement. Bus Éireann is responsible for the safe condition of the vehicles in use and it has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. All vehicles operating under the scheme must meet rigid safety standards.</P>
      <P>Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass Department of the Environment and Local Government tests in regard to roadworthiness. All school transport vehicles are also subject to regular inspection to ensure their reliability is maintained throughout the year. The vehicles must be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during the summer of 1999.</P>
      <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann. The company has a good and long safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard.</P>

The age profile and quality of vehicles used in the Bus Éireann fleet is currently being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement. Apart from refurbishing buses in 1999, CIE is also replacing vehicles. In addition, it is responsible for the contractors it uses and ensuring quality levels. I will raise with CIE the issue of the buses used under contracts but if the Deputy is concerned about any particular buses, I ask him to let me know and I will follow up the matter.</P>

Do these relate to the training of school principals, the provision of resources to implement the Education (Welfare) Act or the increase of capitation grants with greater responsibility for these being devolved to schools?

      <P>The report asked that we proceed with the work being carried out on the database. Efforts are already under way in that regard. The report also referred to the need for a formula funding approach and separate arrangements for funding in relation to educational disadvantage. I will shortly be able to provide figures in respect of educational disadvantage. We carried out a study on that matter and, following its completion, we found there was a need for a more thorough study to ensure the information obtained was as accurate as possible. The second study is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The report also advised that funding should be divided in a particular way and we will examine its recommendations in that regard. The main recommendation under the heading of the non-pay formula and supplementary funding was that 78% of total non-pay funding should be allocated on the basis of enrolments, with account being taken of the insurance arrangements for the three sectors.</P>

      <P>Last February the Government announced the introduction, over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, of the most significant package of supports ever to assist primary school principals. Significant progress has been made in the implementation of these measures to date.</P>
      <P>Administrative principals were previously appointed to primary schools with eight or more mainstream class teachers. With effect from 1 September this year, administrative principals are appointed to all schools with seven mainstream class teachers. I have also introduced for the 2000-01 school year an arrangement whereby principals in schools with a principal plus 11 or more teachers, including ex-quota posts, may be appointed as an administrative principal.</P>
      <P>The introduction of release time for principals in primary schools with six or fewer mainstream class teachers in the 2000-01 and subsequent school years is of major significance to school authorities and principals. The release time enables the teaching principal to be released for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions in the school. Substitution cover is paid by my Department in respect of these release days.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers, the funding allocated by means of additional <i>per capita</i> grants to schools, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has been increased this year to approximately £12.5 million and will be further increased in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million. These improvements mean that since last September all primary schools receive an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The introduction of these measures has also made a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>

The implementation of the different measures I announced last February will continue in the next school year. My Department will commence discussions in the near future with the managerial authorities of primary schools and the INTO regarding the appointment of administrative principals to schools with six or more mainstream class teachers for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

It is a daunting task for many principals to take on large schools. Does the Minister envisage a situation whereby principals in large schools who take on this burden in addition to the level of administrative work they must do, including managerial and other functions, would be appointed for a set period of seven years and then return to the work force retaining their principal's allowance etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the new grants for caretakers and secretaries, how can the Minister stand over a situation where rural schools will be given a grant of £1,200 <Col N="491" /> a year to employ a caretaker and secretary because the Department of Enterprise and Employment has withdrawn the FÁS element of the scheme?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined in Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, civic, social and political education, CSPE, is part of the core curriculum for the junior cycle. The civic, social and political education syllabus states that the course should be allocated one class period per week, or equivalent, so as to allow for a course of approximately 70 hours over the three years of the junior cycle. In practice, this has been interpreted as allowing schools flexibility in how they allocate teaching time over the three years. One cannot conclude that where civic, social and political education is not included on a school timetable for a particular year, that school is failing to meet its obligations to provide the subject as part of its junior cycle programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All recognised post-primary schools operating a junior cycle programme indicated in the October returns for 1999-2000 that they were teaching CSPE. My Department checks returns from schools to ensure that all recognised junior <Col N="492" /> pupils are studying civic, social and political education and, where this requirement appears not to have been met, the matter is followed up, as appropriate, with the school.</P>
    <P>Candidates from the vast majority of post primary schools sat the junior certificate examination in civic, social and political education last June. It is important to remember that the obligation on schools in regard to civic, social and political education relates to the provision of that subject in junior cycle and that students are not obliged to sit the junior certificate examination, even though the vast majority of them did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>In the first instance they should take it up with the school concerned. The Department's information is that the returns from all schools indicate they are all undertaking the course.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present to appoint an ombudsman for education in the terms expressed by the Deputy. Responsibility for monitoring the provision of education facilities and ensuring that adequate education services are made available to all children is a matter for my Department. I assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that all children, irrespective of their needs, receive an adequate education service.</P>
      <P>However, the National Children's Strategy, which has recently been published, makes specific provision for the appointment of an ombudsman for children. The role of the ombudsman will be to promote the welfare and rights of children generally; to investigate complaints from children on issues which affect them; to consult children on issues of importance to them; and to advise Government on issues of importance to children. The ombudsman's role will also encompass issues relating to difficulties encountered by children in relation to their education. The services of the Office of the Ombudsman, established under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, are available to clients of my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of an overall review of its structures and procedures, my Department is considering the introduction of new measures aimed at improving the effective delivery by my Department of education services. In this context consideration is being given to the introduction of independent appeals mechanisms in relation to decisions of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the procedures set out in section 29 of the Education Act, 1999, which facilitate appeals by students or their parents in the event of their being expelled, suspended or refused admission to schools.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the combined impact of the above developments will ensure that all children enjoy access to the education service they require and it is my intention to monitor these arrangements to ensure that this is the case.</P>

We will move on that quickly in regard to children, I hope on a better basis than heretofore. Members have generally argued that some schools regarded as disadvantaged were not being treated as disadvantaged even though they were distinctly disadvantaged. The new method which has been adopted is based on research by the education research centre and provides a much better base for these developments.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important questions on the Order Paper. The Supreme Court determined in the O'Donoghue case in 1993 that every child was entitled to the best education possible under our Constitution. The Sinnott case recently determined the range of neglect by the State in this matter. Will the ombudsman for children have effective powers in implementing and monitoring whether each child receives the best education possible?</P>
      <P>How will the Minister address, for example, two cases I came across this week? One involved a child who had a stroke at one and a half years and has not received physiotherapy for seven years and the other case was a seven year old who cannot avail of speech therapy facilities because the speech therapist employed by the health board cannot cross over to the agency contracted to provide speech therapy and other facilities for such children. How will the Minister answer the parents of such children? Is this not patent neglect by the Department over which he presides?</P>

For example, there were 299 assistants for children in schools at that time whereas there are now 1,400 and the number is increasing continuously as the needs of the children are met. The same applies to resource teachers and other categories of assistance for children with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide for the funding of technical assistance for the two regional operational programmes in the national development plan and the community support framework.</P>
      <P>The establishment orders for the regional authorities and regional assemblies provide that the Minister for Finance may recoup to the authorities and assemblies, costs related to the carrying out of their EU functions. In the 1994-99 programming period, expenditure on the regional authority EU operational committees and related costs were recouped on a quarterly basis by the Department of Finance. These costs were paid from the community support framework technical assistance operational programme and were charged to subhead L of the vote of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations earlier this year on the Community Support Framework 2000 &ndash; 2006, my Department proposed to the European Commission that the recoupment of the EU costs of the newly created regional assemblies should be provided for on a similar basis to that which operated for the regional authorities in the 1994-99 period, that is, from CSF technical assistance. The European Commission, while accepting the principle that the EU costs of the regional assemblies and the existing regional authorities should be funded from technical assistance, expressed a preference for such costs to be met from a separate technical assistance budget within each of the regional operational programmes. We agreed to this Commission proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, to give effect to the new arrangement and to introduce greater transparency from a financial accounting perspective, I propose in <Col N="505" /> this Supplementary Estimate to create a new subhead within the Department of Finance Vote for funding technical assistance in regional operational programmes. This will cover costs in relation to monitoring, information and publicity and the mid-term evaluation of the regional operational programmes, and the eligible costs of the EU operational committees of the regional authorities in the S&amp;E and BMW regions.</P>
    <P>On the basis of previous annual expenditure and claims so far this year by the regional authorities, as well as the expenditure arising in connection with the monitoring of the regional operational programmes, the regional assemblies estimates for technical assistance costs in 2000 is £280,000 rising to £560,000 in 2001.</P>
    <P>Since it is expected that there will be sufficient savings elsewhere in the Vote for my Department to meet the expenditure arising this year, I propose at this stage to seek the approval of the Dáil for a token Supplementary Estimate of £1,000 and to arrange for expenditure from the subhead to be met from the savings arising.</P>
    <P>The gross amount will be provided in the Vote and will be advanced to the regional assemblies quarterly, on the basis of returns of the previous quarter's expenditure and estimates for the following quarter. The expenditure will be co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund at an aid rate of 75% and 50% in the Border, midlands and west, and southern and eastern regions respectively.</P>
    <P>The other costs of the regional assemblies will be funded directly by the constituent local authorities in proportion to their respective populations.</P>
    <P>I use this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work done by the assemblies since their establishment over one year ago. The assemblies, in their role as managing authority for the two regional operational programmes, have participated in the negotiation and agreement with the European Commission of the Community Support Framework for Ireland. They have subsequently been directly engaged, assisted by my Department, in negotiating the regional operational programmes with the European Commission. I am pleased to report that the two regional operational programmes will be formally signed by Commissioner Barnier in Brussels in the presence of regional assembly representatives next Monday.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the regional assemblies have also concluded the preparations for and secured the approval of their operational programme monitoring committee to the programme complements for the regional operational programmes. The programme complements set out at measure level the detailed operational arrangements, including project selection criteria. This rate of progress in the relatively short period since their establishment is testimony to the good co-operation which has been developed between the regional assemblies and central Departments and State bodies and augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> I take this opportunity to briefly refute some misleading commentary on progress under the national development plan made in the wake of the publication of the Estimates for 2001 last week. Certain commentators equated the relatively small level of savings anticipated in the 2000 public capital programme with lack of progress on the infrastructural programme in the national development plan. This is an incorrect deduction. In key national development plan infrastructural areas such as roads, public transport and environmental services, 2000 expenditure is generally in line with the targets when the national development plan was published one year ago. Expenditure is behind plan profile in some areas of the production sector operational programme such as research and development and industrial promotion grants. These underspends in 2000 will not undermine the achievement of the national development plan objectives in the areas in question. The reality is that national development plan infrastructural expenditure is generally on track and the 2001 Estimates provisions will ensure the momentum is maintained.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the Supplementary Estimate because the devolution of power and responsibility to the regions should be welcomed. The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to fund the new regional authorities directly from the Department of Finance. I hope the way is now clear for the first time for badly needed jobs to flow to the west, midlands and Border counties. In spite of all the hype and expectations about what Objective One status would do, there has been no change in the economic circumstances of the west, north-west and midlands. New jobs continue to be created primarily in the east, adding to congestion and the unhealthy economic imbalance which has been the position for far too long. There has been the occasional jobs announcement for areas outside the pale, invariably in the larger provincial growth centres, thus allowing the starvation of the rural hinterland to continue.</P>
      <P>The rhetoric of the Tánaiste, the IDA and Forbairt about jobs dispersal to the regions is seen for what it is. The annual reports of the IDA and Forbairt stand all such aspirations on their heads. While I welcome today's announcement of 800 jobs for Cavan, the Tánaiste's comment that it is the first significant jobs announcement by the IDA for Cavan in the past 22 years is extremely significant. Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and other counties in the west and midlands have a lot of catching up to do. Without infrastructure, one will not attract jobs. There is an infrastructural deficit in these regions. It is hopelessly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example. If an industry of any significance wishing to locate in the west or north-west demanded a reasonable power supply, it could not be supplied. The Electricity Supply <Col N="507" /> Board confirmed that this is the situation when I met it recently. Irrespective of the goodwill of the Government and the IDA, power could not be supplied from the grid for a significant industry wishing to locate between Galway and Cavan. This matter is not being addressed.</P>
    <P>In the north-west the service has been perilously close to collapse on more than one occasion. Not alone have we had amber alerts, we have had red alerts. There are two emergency generators in the former Asahi plant in Killala rented by the ESB for six months from General Electric in the United States at a cost of $20 million, and a further three in Aghada in County Cork. There has been no forward planning in relation to the need for generating capacity and upgrading of the grid in these regions.</P>
    <P>I remain sceptical about the Government's intentions towards the west, midlands and Border counties. Fortuitously, the Corrib gas field off Achill Head will come on stream as the Old Head of Kinsale gas field begins to dry up. It is a hugely significant find, guaranteeing a gas supply for consumers and industry for the next 20 to 25 years. In spite of this, there has not been a scintilla of coherent thinking in the national development plan about its development to create lasting and sustainable jobs and industry in the region, which has been starved of jobs for generations and has seen its natural resources bled to create jobs elsewhere. So much for planning.</P>
    <P>Regional authorities are a fine concept provided they are not talking shops or rubber stamps for the purpose of disbursing moneys for designs and plans drawn on drawing boards outside the regions. Real power is what is required. For far too long the regions were bled white by emigration. Now they are being bled by migration. Nothing has changed. What is needed is a coherent development plan providing for investment in infrastructure and jobs. Jobs are the magnet and the anchor. One can have all the aspirations in the world, but without jobs in the regions congestion in Dublin and the east will continue and the lifestyle of the west will continue to be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too negative. The money is welcome, as are the regional assemblies. What is needed are regional authorities with teeth, bite, money and decision-making powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with everything Deputy Higgins said. He took my powder. I also welcome the Supplementary Estimate for the regional authorities. I am sure that Deputies Higgins and Burke will agree that we have all the plans we want in place for the west, what is needed is action. As Deputy Higgins said, the IDA has failed the west. I have lost confidence in it for many years. It has done nothing to promote or attract jobs to the west. It is Dublin based and thinks only in terms of Dublin. I hope today's jobs announcement for Cavan will be the first of many for the west, midlands and Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Deputy Higgins referred to the power grid in the west. Last year, on new year's eve, when a large number of people arrived in Achill for the holiday weekend there was a power surge with the result that the entire structure collapsed. This cannot continue. Each time there has been a storm or a flock of birds has flown overhead in recent winters in north Mayo there has been a power cut and the people have suffered as a result.</P>
    <P>This is the first time there has been a gas find off the north-west coast. There has been talk of a line from north Mayo to Galway to pipe the gas to the North and England. Once more, the people of Mayo and the west will suffer at a time when it should have the opportunity for the first time to attract industrialists from all over the world to the region with the promise of natural gas on line at a cheaper cost than electricity. I hope this opportunity will not be wasted.</P>
    <P>Since his appointment the Minister has travelled to the west on many occasions. He is a man for whom I have much time. The Minister has travelled from Longford to Charlestown. That road is our greatest national scandal. Deputy Higgins and I travel it three or four times a week, as does Deputy Moffatt. If an industrialist were considering investing in the west of Ireland he would have to bear in mind that he, his wife and his directors would have to travel that road every week or month and would immediately decide not to invest in the west.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority and the Minister should give the west a small advantage. There is no infrastructure between Longford and Charlestown. The Minister should direct the National Roads Authority to complete the road next year, instead of the daft planned date of 2014 or 2015, and give us the opportunity to attract people to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises from the unusual decision the Government took last year to invent regions which had not existed previously. The purpose of that decision was to deal with the management of European funding.</P>
      <P>The problem, however, is that this country does not have a regional policy. Look at the range of regional structures. There is a different regional structure for every function. The new regional authorities are a manufactured entity for the purposes of European funding. They do not have any other function or purpose. There are also regional authorities which were established on the basis of local government entities, that is, groupings of existing local authorities established as regional authorities. Their functions are limited. The most recent task they were given relates to the waste management strategies to be adopted in different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a different regional structure for the delivery of health services. There is another regional structure under the IDA and its associated agencies for industrial development while <Col N="509" /> there are other structures for tourism and fisheries. For every function of Government there is a different regional structure and none of the boundaries of their regions correspond. That is not a regional policy; it is chaos. The Minister for Finance is dealing with this Supplementary Estimate but it is properly the function of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to rationalise the regional structures. We either have regional authorities which have a wide range of functions and co-ordinate economic and infrastructural development across a region in a real sense or we stop the pretence that we have a regional policy. At present, we do not have a regional policy.</P>
    <P>The lack of regional policy or regionalism, if one can use that term, is also to be found in the approach to the development of the national development plan and the fact that two years after that plan was published there is now talk about the development of a national spatial strategy. That is putting the cart before the horse. The national spatial strategy should have been developed first and investment options and strategy should have been based on that.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency, which is probably understandable, to have a degree of competitive talking in relation to regions. One part of the country might talk about another part of the country getting all the investment and resources. The part of the country that is supposed to be getting all the investment and resources in turn might believe that within its boundaries there are high levels of deprivation and disadvantage which are being ignored because of an emphasis on geography and on other parts of the country. However, we live in a new era. In many respects, geographic location is not as important as it was when telecommunications, transport and so forth were of a different order. People can now communicate irrespective of where they are located and there are huge new possibilities in relation in transport. Issues such as investment, location of industry and services, where people live and how they communicate with each other have changed. The approach to regional policy, therefore, must be changed to reflect that.</P>
    <P>New types of problems are emerging. One of the issues which has, rightly, been raised by representatives from areas of the country which were regarded as geographically peripheral from the centre and the capital related to the lack of investment. There is a new problem and it relates not so much to the lack of investment as to inappropriate investment. This was discussed in the context of the debate on the Planning and Development Bill. It arose with regard to development in Gaeltacht areas. The remoteness which at one time inhibited development or investment is now the reason inappropriate investment and development are occurring. There are, therefore, new problems which need to be tackled in a new way.</P>
    <P>The main problem is that we do not have a regional policy. This Estimate, unfortunately, is a <Col N="510" /> carry over from an <i>ad hoc </i>decision which is part of a pattern of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions in relation to all regional policy here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate. The west of Ireland has sufficient plans and structures in place. What we need now is action and concrete proof that the west is getting its fair share.</P>
      <P>We regularly hear that hackneyed phrase, &ldquo;the Celtic tiger&rdquo;. Every person in east Galway, including business people, will tell the Minister that they have not benefited from the Celtic tiger. The pilot scheme for the upper Shannon region was wonderful and there were downstream benefits from it. East Galway is located in the middle Shannon basin and east of Galway city. Galway is the hub of the action; it is the country's fastest growing city and I welcome that. East Galway is also north of SFADCo, the Shannon development zone, and to the east is Athlone, another area that is prospering. To the north is the upper Shannon region which I already mentioned.</P>
      <P>However, there has not been development or job creation in east Galway. The IDA has forgotten the area. I attended a subcommittee meeting this morning which discussed the unbundling of Eircom. I have the greatest sympathy for Eircom on this issue, where predators are coming in from outside, assisted by Government Departments. The IDA, Forfás and the Department are encouraging outsiders to come in while at the same time creating an impossible situation for Eircom. There will be cherry picking of the main areas of the market by these other providers while Eircom will be left to provide services to isolated areas in rural County Galway and the west. This is unfair. Ms Doyle should balance the market. I am not sure there is much sympathy in her brief in regard to ensuring a level playing pitch for all providers involved in the provision of a communications system for the west.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider providing the middle Shannon region with the facilities, entitlements and benefits from which the upper Shannon region benefited enormously in a short period due to his action. I call on him to provide a similar pilot scheme for the middle Shannon region so that people recognise such development is in response to a Government initiative.</P>
      <P>The IDA should be made realise that not one IDA assisted job was created in Ballinasloe in the past 25 years. The same applies to Loughrea, Gort and Athenry, all in east Galway. Why is that the case?  The IDA is centred in Galway and will continue to focus on locating industry there while the rest of the region goes without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are plans for the gas pipeline and major national routes to pass through the region. I would like the Minister to clarify the position regarding compensation for the landowners who will be affected by such works. We have been told that An Bord Gáis will pay £33 per metre in compensation to the farmers through whose lands the <Col N="511" /> pipeline will run. Will that be taxed at the full rate? If it is, farmers will receive much less than that proposed. Local authorities are currently mandated to compensate landowners at the rate of £8,000 per acre. Given the upward swing in the price of agricultural land, is that a realistic figure, particularly when one considers the damage that will be done by carving up farmers' lands and farming units? It is not. I hope the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will revisit the matter of compensation to enable the plans to succeed and the deadlines to be met, which we hope they will be, to draw down the funds to provide those facilities under the national plan.</P>

      <P>Not to be outdone by my western colleagues and friends, I want to put in my oar and tuppence worth for the Border region, the most deprived region in the country. The region has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles over the past 30 years without recognition from any Government, including those of which my party was a member. At one stage, the region almost withered to extinction. I congratulate the Minister on his efforts in the past few years and ask him for increased spending in that region, as it has fallen behind over the years due to the problems I illustrated.</P>
      <P>While Dundalk has experienced some of the benefits of the Celtic tiger in recent times, there are concerns about a major industry there, and another footwear industry, in what was the home of footwear, has been reduced to 20 workers.  There are concerns about several industries in Dundalk. I ask the Minister to consider the Dundalk region for the purposes of investment. There has been no major investment in Ardee for the past 20 years to 30 years. There are also serious concerns about rising unemployment in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Dunleer bypass, the Border region and the west have fallen behind other parts of the country in the provision of flyovers and improved roads. The Border region has not had its fair share of public spending. I ask the Minister to ensure that funding is provided for the much needed western bypass, which would link Newry with Dundalk and ultimately join up with the major roadway to Dublin. Increased spending is required in an area that was ravaged by unemployment in recent years. Thankfully, the position is not as bad as it was, but we need increased spending to bring it up to par with other regions.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore who called for a real regional basis to be established rather than the current structure, under which we simply avail of EU funding, welcome as it is, that goes into the coffers of the Department of Finance. Each region needs a specific policy, but the needs of the Border and the west should be the Government's priority.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil proceeds to consider the amendments tabled to the Bill on Report Stage, I propose to explain the Chair's position in relation to amendment No. 22 tabled by Deputy McDowell. Amendment No. 22 is similar to amendment No. 21 in Committee, which was disallowed as involving a potential charge on the Exchequer. The current amendment differs from amendment No. 21 in Committee in that the phrase &ldquo;if and only if he or she is satisfied that to do so would not involve an actual or potential charge on public funds&rdquo; has been added. My concern in relation to the amendment is that it can be reasonably regarded as no more than a device to circumvent the provisions of Standing Order 142(2). I expressed similar concerns in relation to amendments tabled to the Social Welfare Bill, 1999, indicating that the allowance of amendments of this kind will have to be reviewed in the future. I have decided to allow amendment No. 22 at this point in time and the amendment will be discussed with amendment No. 17 when that amendment is reached. If, however, in the course of debate, it appears there is a basis to the concerns I have outlined, the Chair has the authority to rule the amendment out of order. Members should, therefore, be very <Col N="513" /> careful and bear this in mind in contributing to the debate on the amendments.</P>
      <P>We will dispose of the amendments as per the brief. Amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 5 will be taken together by agreement. Is Deputy McDowell moving amendment No. 1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Committee of Public Accounts' means the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriate accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are technical amendments regarding the designation of a chief executive officer of the manager as the accounting officer for the fund. Section 26 as it stands designates the chief executive officer of the manager as the accounting officer of the fund for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, 1866 to 1998. However, these provisions define an accounting officer in terms of functions in respect of the appropriation accounts. The manner in which accounting officers are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts is set out in section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993. As the chief executive officer of the manager is not an accounting officer within the meaning of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts &ndash; that is, he does not have a function in respect of the appropriation accounts &ndash; the section needs to be amended.</P>
      <P>The approach in amendment No. 25 is to apply the substance of the provisions of section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, specifically to the manager in relation to the fund. This approach has been previously taken in similar legislation such as the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, where the respective chief executive officers were made accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the bodies established under those Acts.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is simply a formal definition of the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of its functions which ensures that references to the Committee of Public Accounts will always be construed as references to the Committee of Dáil Éireann appointed to perform those functions.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 11 and 12, after &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in the Irish language Coimisiún an Chúlchiste Náisiúnta Pinsean,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 confers the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission with a statutory Irish language title and is being made on foot of the two amendments put down by Deputy McDowell which were also put down on Committee Stage. On Committee Stage I signalled that I had no problem in principle with the aim of the Deputy's proposed amendments but that there were some issues of detail that needed to be considered further and I undertook to consult the Chief Parliamentary Counsel with a view to bringing forward an appropriate amendment on Report Stage. Amendment No. 5 addresses these issues of detail.</P>
      <P>First, the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission will be a body that operates internationally and it is important that its title be easily recognised. In such cases it is the practice to place the English version of the name first and then to provide an Irish translation. Second, it is not necessary to amend the Long Title of the Act as is provided for in amendment No. 4. The Deputy has withdrawn the other amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, shall apply to the Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is similar to an amendment I put down on Committee Stage to extend the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to the body being set up under this Bill. In fairness to the Government, I was one of those who approached this with a little cynicism and I expected that once the Freedom of Information Act was extended to Departments of State they might very well grind to a halt. In fairness to the Minister and his Minister of State, it has been extended in the intervening years to quite a few statutory bodies including local authorities and health boards. That is an altogether good thing and the principle is now well nigh established that State or semi-State bodies should be subject to that Act. It goes without saying that the many exemptions in the Act would take away much of the relevance of the Act to some of the workings of this commission. Clearly the deliberative process exemption would come into play, as would the commercial activity exemption. In terms of the administrative process and the decision-making process, once decisions are made that apply to the commission, as a matter of principle the Act should be extended to the com<Col N="515" /> mission at this stage. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would consider this at some future point and as a matter of principle, as we set up State bodies of any kind we should apply the Act automatically to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, commenced for central Government and related bodies on 21 April 1998. It was extended to health boards and local authorities six months later and to voluntary hospitals and certain publicly funded voluntary bodies providing services for people with an intellectual disability in October 1999. In December last year the Government decided to extend the Act incrementally between May 2000 and no later than July 2001 to a range of other bodies in the enterprise, electricity, telecommunications regulation, cultural and broadcasting, universities, health services, environmental and social services sectors.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information will be extended incrementally across the wider public sector as experience is gained in its application. Its application to the commission will be decided in the context of extensions of the Act generally. In drafting this Bill room was made for the possible application of the Freedom of Information Act at a later date. I refer specifically to section 13, prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information about the fund by the commissioner, a member of the staff, a member of a committee, an investment manager, a custodian or a consultant or adviser engaged by the commission except where such disclosure is authorised by the commission or where the disclosure is otherwise provided for by law. This latter exception caters, <i>inter alia</i>, for the requirement to disclose information in a court of law or where disclosure is required under some other statute, for example, the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Bill contains significant provisions to ensure transparency and accountability. These include section 25, which requires the chairperson of the commission to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts; section 26(3), which provides for the preparation of annual accounts for the audit of accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the laying of such audited accounts by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas; section 26(4), which requires the chief executive of the agency, as accounting officer for the fund, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to give evidence on matters relating to the accounts; section 27(1), which requires the commission to make an annual report to the Minister on its activities, after which a report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas; and section 27(4), which enables the Minister for Finance to have an examination carried out from time to time into various aspects of the operation of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions will ensure that detailed <Col N="516" /> information regarding the management of the fund will be in the public arena. As I have said already, the question of making the commission subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will be considered at a later date in the context of the general extension of that Act. Therefore I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has set out the laudable record of his Department in implementing the Act. He has set out the various accountability provisions of this Bill and he has also said the Bill allows for the possibility of an extension of the Freedom of Information Act to the commission at some stage in the future. However, he has not given one reason it cannot be extended to the commission now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 44, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following consultation with such committee of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas as may be appointed in that behalf by resolution of either or both such Houses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the appointment of the commissioners. I commend the Minister on having taken the innovative step of setting out conditions which the commissioners must meet &ndash; that they must have certain qualifications which are set out in broad detail in the Act. That is a step forward and has not been normal practice in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his typically disarming fashion, said on Committee Stage that he thought something along these lines was a thoroughly good idea and was being considered by Government but that he was not going to set a precedent at this stage. We have since heard a little about the Government's intentions in the area of standards in public life and I am interested in hearing from the Minister whether movement along the lines suggested by this amendment is likely to be part of Government proposals in the near future. If it is &ndash; or even if it is not &ndash; the Minister should apply his pioneering zeal to the provisions in this Bill, set a precedent and the standard to which his colleagues can be required to adhere in the future. It is a good idea and is in the interests of all concerned that the committee of the Dáil relevant to this case, the finance committee, should at least have the names of appointees flagged to it. I have deliberately phrased the amendment loosely. It does not require that the committee should sanction or vote upon the appointment of particular commissioners; it merely requires that there should be consultation with the committee so that information can be provided and committee members given an opportunity to express their view, if they have a view, on the appointment of particular commissioners. In that sense it is not looking to break <Col N="517" /> down the barriers excessively. It is simply looking to establish a principle or a precedent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main function of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission are to control, manage and invest the assets of the fund. By investing control and management of the fund in the commission, the Bill gives the commission full independence and responsibility for the investment, management and operational decisions in connection with the fund.</P>
      <P>In view of the considerable discretionary authority and responsibility to be given to the commission, it will be important to ensure that persons selected to serve as commissioners have the capability, judgment and stature to make a constructive contribution to the work of the commission. Accordingly, section 7(4) requires the Minister to appoint persons on the basis of their experience and expertise at senior level in specified areas such as investment, management, actuarial practice, the pensions industry etc. Thus the Bill, as it stands, contains measures which will go a long way towards ensuring that only persons of the higher calibre may be appointed commissioners.</P>
      <P>This amendment appears to contain wider issues which would need to be considered in the context of ministerial appointments generally. To accept the principle that the Minister for Finance should consult an Oireachtas committee with regard to the appointment of this commission raises the issue of whether Ministers should consult the Oireachtas before making appointments to boards, committees and bodies generally. This is an issue which needs to be considered on its own merits. If the Oireachtas were to decide that Ministers should be consulted before making appointments generally, I would have no problem with such a requirement applying in respect of appointments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission. I have difficulty, however, with such a requirement being applied to an appointment of the commission which could be interpreted as setting a precedent with regard to other ministerial appointments. Therefore, I have to reject the amendment. As I said on Committee Stage, this area deserves wider consideration and the Government will give it due consideration. My pioneering zeal in some areas is not greatly appreciated by everybody all the time.</P>

    <P>As I set out in the debate on the previous amendment, it is important, in view of the considerable discretionary authority and responsibility to be given to the commission, to ensure that persons selected to serve as commissioners have the capability, judgment and stature to make a constructive contribution to the work of the commission. Accordingly, section 7(4) limits the Minister to choosing as commissioners persons who have acquired substantial experience and expertise at senior level in specified areas such as investment management, actuarial practice, the pensions industry etc.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands leaves the decision as to what constitutes substantial expertise to the Minister's opinion. On Committee Stage, Deputy Noonan suggested that deleting the phrase &ldquo;in his or her opinion&rdquo; would remove the possibility that the Minister could appoint a patently unsuitable person but could argue that it was his or her opinion that the person possessed suitable qualifications. The amendment gives effect to his suggestion.</P>

It is well worthwhile that the Minister has a section in the Bill, which will act as precedent for similar sections in the future, whereby persons appointed to be commissioners or, in future, to boards, agencies or State organisations, will objectively have expertise in the area to which they are appointed. If that is the policy decision, the opinion of the Minister should not enter into it. The curriculum vitae of the appointee should be a test and it should be possible to illustrate objectively that the person appointed had expertise in the areas referred to in the section.

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Noonan suggested, in discussing the amendment he has <Col N="519" /> tabled here again on Report Stage, that there is room on the commission for a non-expert with a common-sense approach whose primary function would not be to use his or her expertise to enable the commission to make appropriate decisions but to bear in mind at all times the primacy of the beneficiaries of the fund.</P>
    <P>While I would stress that the commission will be an expert rather than a representative body, and appointments will not necessarily be made from all the categories set out in section 7(4), I take Deputy Noonan's point and I have brought forward amendment No. 9 to give effect to it. In that context, I ask Deputy Noonan to withdraw his amendment and to support my amendment on the basis that it gives effect to the principle of his amendment but is drafted in somewhat wider terms and would thus give more flexibility in appointing a suitable person with the background suggested by Deputy Noonan.</P>

It is normal practice for members of semi-State boards, committees and commissions to be paid fees and expenses. Section 7(10) makes it possible for such remuneration to be provided to the commissioners. As I stated on Committee Stage, commissioners will have a considerable amount of work to do and I envisage that they will have to devote a part of their working week to the service of the fund. They should be recompensed accordingly for that commitment. Acceptance of this amendment would, by failing to even repay expenses, impose monetary costs on commissioners for a time-consuming and important job which they are performing in the service of the State. I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give some order of magnitude of the level of remuneration he intends paying, or the range of remuneration within which the honorarium might fall? I am not sure whether he intends it to be analogous to a director's fee of a semi-State company or he envisages it to be salary for committing oneself for half the working week to the work of the commission.</P>

      <P>I do not have with me the range of directors' fees paid to semi-State bodies but there are three categories. From the lowest to the highest category they are very small, in the region of £4,000 to £7,500 for an ordinary director of a semi-State company. On the other hand, the full-time responsibility of a person of this calibre would be many multiples of £7,500. Given that commissioners will have to devote part of their work to this fund, I see the figure as being in excess of that level. However, it would not be in the region of that received by the Secretary General of a Department. I have not worked out this yet&mdash;</P>

      <P>I just put it from one extreme to the other. It was my intention to revise the fees given to directors of semi-State companies. This proposal has been around for some time and was considered by the previous Administration. The last Buckley report recommended new governance procedures and an updating of fees in this regard. I intended to introduce some changes but some months ago I decided to await the new <Col N="521" /> Buckley report to see the categories in which it placed semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>When I consulted Government colleagues they all naturally thought semi-State companies under their remit should go to a higher category. That is why I decided the best course of action was to wait for the Buckley report and have another stab at this issue. I am signalling my general intention to increase the level of fees paid to directors of semi-State companies but not to an extraordinary extent. I see the level of such fees as higher than those currently paid but not as high as those paid at the highest levels in the public service. I will consider this issue further to decide on the levels.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commission shall, with the consent of the Minister, prepare and publish an ethical investment policy which the Commission shall apply in holding or investing monies standing to the credit of the Fund and which shall <i>inter alia</i> prohibit investment in enterprises involved in the armaments industry and the tobacco industry.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would oblige the commission, with the consent of the Minister, to prepare and publish an ethical investment policy. In recent months the Minister repeatedly stated his intention to distance himself and his successors from the operation of the fund. While I have no difficulty with this in principle, there are some major exceptions which we need to make. Primary among these exceptions is the need to ensure that investments of taxpayers' money is consistent with the rest of Government policy. It makes no sense for Government to seek to discourage the use of tobacco or, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to oppose the armaments industry or the proliferation of arms if taxpayers' money is being applied to the opposite end. This amendment seeks to oblige the commission to prepare a policy which would give effect to an investment policy which is consistent with the gamut of Government policy and not with the singular aim of making more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining the investment policy of the fund, I considered whether the policy should be strictly commercial or whether it should be qualified by ethical, environmental and other public policy criteria. A major difficulty in deciding on an ethical investment policy is where to draw the line, given there will be different opinions and intense debate on what constitutes ethical and socially responsible investments. In short, there is unlikely to be broad consensus on any ethical investment policy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the list of what might be considered as unacceptable investments is likely to continually change in light of developments in the political, social and scientific spheres. If one was to attempt to delineate appropriate investments for the fund there is a great danger of dragging the commission into a quagmire of public controversy and paralysing the fund's investment procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these considerations, I examined a number of approaches which might be taken to implement an ethical investment policy. One could copy the UK precedent whereby from July of this year the annual report of pension funds will have to contain a statement of the <Col N="524" /> approach to ethical investments adopted by a fund. There will be no requirement on funds to invest in this manner but merely to state their policy.</P>
    <P>A fund can use its voting rights to put pressure on companies to pursue ethical policies. It appears this approach can be accommodated within a commercial mandate, though its effectiveness is somewhat debatable, particularly as the shareholding in a fund of any one company will be relatively small. Some funds put aside a small portion of their assets into a separate fund which is invested according to ethical criteria. The drawback with this approach is that it is largely tokenism with the majority of the fund being invested in the normal manner.</P>
    <P>Screening is an approach being used by some funds. This involves hiring analysts to examine all companies on an index. The analysts identify those companies with assets of the class to which the investor objects or, alternatively, companies adopting best practice. Having done so, the investment managers of the fund in question are given the target of beating the adjusted index, that is the index excluding the forbidden sectors or companies by a set percentage.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of drawbacks to this approach. For example, major costs are involved in hiring analysts and tracking the performance of the adjusted index. These costs would be multiplied for a large fund where a number of indices will be tracked. In addition, as the list of forbidden investments lengthens, there will be an increased risk of the portfolio becoming less diversified.</P>
    <P>There would also be other operational difficulties. For example, with a customised portfolio it would not be possible to use equity futures to hedge against market exposure as such futures contracts are linked to broad market indices. In addition, there would be less opportunity to undertake crossing transactions whereby equities are traded directly with other funds, thereby cutting out brokers and reducing fees.</P>
    <P>Clearly there would be significant difficulties in incorporating an ethical policy into the investment mandate, no matter what approach is taken in pursuing such a policy. Accordingly, the investment mandate included in the legislation is modelled on the standard commercial mandate for private pension funds, namely, maximise returns subject to prudent risk management. Indeed, any explicit reference to ethical investment would politicise the investment mandate and would give rise to significant difficulties both in its interpretation and in its implementation. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has effectively argued is that because it is very difficult to give any kind of ethical mandate to fund managers, he has decided to opt out completely. I do not think he should have opted out simply because it is a very difficult area to regulate. I would not like future pension funds to be invested in the arma<Col N="525" /> ments industry. Other people might have no objection to that. There are aspects of the pharmaceutical industry to which some people might object, although I would have little enough objection to that. One man's ethic might be another man's neutral position. Situation ethics are becoming more common than ethics deriving from any particular religion or set of beliefs.</P>
      <P>There is, however, an issue which Deputy McDowell's amendment addresses. I think the Minister is shirking it because of the difficulty of it. I cannot see why, in general terms, the commission should not be directed to be conscious of the ethical feelings of the public. While as was said, it is difficult to decide what particular investments would be ruled out, what might be ruled in or what the mechanism may be, there would be a general view about some aspects of investment in Ireland. A non-specific direction to commission might be of benefit.</P>
      <P>I would not like if an Irish pension fund had a heavy portfolio of South African investment when the struggle was at its most difficult in South Africa and when the rest of the world was treating the South African supremacist administration as a pariah. There was a general policy of not investing there. Issues will arise and while the Minister has recited what is being done in other jurisdictions and generally came to the conclusion that none of them is effective, we should at least indicate somewhere in the relationship between the Minister and the commission that there may be considerations other than strictly commercial ones and that the commission should be aware that there are considerations other than commercial ones in certain circumstances even if these are not specified.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has met the views expressed on Second Stage. I know why the Minister is following this line &ndash; it is the easiest line to follow. It is certainly the most clearcut line to follow but I do not think it meets the foreseeable circumstances when the commission comes to invest. Without some indication from the Minister, it seems it cannot take ethical considerations into account. If a fund is being managed by a fund manager from Germany, the commission will have no say if the fund is invested in what the generality of Irish people might regard as an unethical company.</P>
      <P>We should maintain some control &ndash; the commission should have some control. Somebody should have some say. It is like a couple of parallels in history. If we do not make an exception, the opposite applies. By having no reference to considerations other than commercial ones, we are mandating the agency and the commission to act on commercial grounds only. That is the problem with it. It is not that it would act on commercial grounds, but commercial grounds is the only valid interpretation. The Minister is preventing it, in its discussions, from considering anything of an ethical or political nature or whatever words one would like to use. The Minister might think about this again on his way to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not seek to set out an ethical investment policy, it merely requires that the commission should prepare an ethical investment policy with the consent of the Minister. There are just two requirements specifically set out in this amendment, that is, that there should be no investment in the armaments or the tobacco industries. Beyond that, substantial discretion would be available to the Minister and the commission in developing an ethical investment policy. That is the major point I would make.</P>
      <P>The Minister accuses me of politicising the issue or suggests that decisions of the commission would be politicised and, of course, he is right. That is precisely what I seek to do here because the investment of money is not just a purely business matter. The investment of taxpayers' money is a political matter and has a significant political and ethical side to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by side-stepping it and basically saying that the use of taxpayers' money is not a political matter, is himself making a moral and political judgment in relation to the use of taxpayers' money. He is effectively saying: &ldquo;This is only business, keep politics, values and ethics out of it and let us get on with the business of generating more money.&rdquo;  I do not think that would be acceptable to the majority of Irish people. I am not asking the Minister to set out an ethical investment policy now, I am merely asking that he amend the Bill to allow the commission to develop such a policy, with his consent, in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 15, after line 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister may by order give directions to the Commission to require it to hold or invest monies standing to the credit of the Fund in a manner specified in the order and otherwise than in a manner which secures the optimum total financial return thereon, where the Minister is satisfied that such requirement is conducive to the common good.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are also related to amendment No. 19 and Deputy Noonan referred to the central point. As formulated, the Bill requires the commission to get optimal benefit from the investment of funds. This effectively requires it to make the most possible money irrespective of any other consideration. As formulated, it requires it to disregard any other consideration and this is where the difficulty arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendments, I have tried to develop a mechanism under which the Minister can indicate and, if necessary, give a direction to the commission in relation to a particular type of investment. The type of investment I envisage is similar to the type referred to in relation to the previous <Col N="528" /> amendment. It would enable the Minister, if he chose to do so, to give a direction that, for example, investment in South Africa should be terminated if that was his and the Government's view at the time.</P>
    <P>At it stands, the Bill does not provide such a mechanism for the Minister. By setting out the requirement that there must be optimal return, it prevents the commission from taking that view on its own. The Minister's comments in relation to the earlier amendment appear to suggest that not only does the Bill not contain an ethical policy and the Minister does not intend to set such a policy, but it prohibits the commission from doing any of the various things he described, such as screening, dealing with futures, etc. This is wrong. The commission should at least have the discretion to make these decisions and to follow those policies with the consent of the Minister. I suspect that, in rare circumstances, the Minister may have the power to direct the commission to make or discontinue a particular type of investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the amendments, it would be useful to set out the key principles I enshrined in the legislation establishing the fund. I am extremely conscious that the people's money is being invested in the fund and I have, therefore, constructed the fund to enable it to match the returns achieved by private pension funds. To this end, the fund will operate like a private pension fund. Its investment strategy cannot be influenced by other policy considerations and the fund moneys cannot be used by future Governments for other purposes. These aims are reflected in two key features of the Bill.</P>
      <P>First, the fund will be managed by commissioners who will be independent of Government and will control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. The independence of the commissioners is the cornerstone of the legislation. To prevent the fund being politicised, a development which would seriously compromise the investment return, I have deliberately ensured that the Minister for Finance does not have any right to give directions to the commissioners or set the criteria to which they must adhere.</P>
      <P>Second, this investment strategy will be based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimum return over the long term, subject to prudent risk management. I do not consider it appropriate to ask the commissioners to take other national or social objectives into account when determining an investment mandate for the fund. Any dilution of the commercial nature of the investment mandate, for example, by requiring the commissioners to support particular projects in Ireland, could seriously compromise the returns achieved by the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the fund and the justification for asking the taxpayer to make a contribution to it of 1% of gross national product each year is to <Col N="529" /> provide, as far as possible, for the costs of future pensions. The State has a solemn duty to do everything it can, in accordance with prudence, to maximise the return on this investment. The use of fund moneys for any other objective, no matter how laudable, should not be countenanced. Such objectives are worth considering and if they are worth achieving, they can be obtained in other ways. The amendments could affect these key features of the fund and I, therefore, cannot accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>An analogy would be the position of regulators &ndash; the Department of Public Enterprise in particular has dealt with this matter at great length &ndash; where the Government sets the policy and the regulators administer it and deal with it on a day to day basis. There is an overlap and this is acknowledged, but the primary responsibility in the first instance falls on the Minister or the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to suggest that he is divesting himself of the policy making role. He is satisfied that one section in the Bill will set the policy for the next 25 years and that, after that time, it will be up to the commission to do the business. This is not sufficient in terms of the policy making role of the Government and the Minister. He must at least retain a discretion on occasion to intervene and to set the policy in the future.</P>

      <P>As I explained on previous Stages, I do not agree with that contention. I readily accept there are other viewpoints but, as officials in my Department will testify, I am certain about the way I want the fund to be established and that it should not be under the control, either directly or indirectly, of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I was amused after the Bill was published that an editorial comment in one of the national newspapers stated that it was obvious the fund would be under the control of the Department of Finance. However, an article in relation to the press conference about the Bill gave the correct detail that this was the last thing the Minister wanted. Any cursory reading of the Bill would indicate that, if I should be criticised at all, it should be because the opposite is the case and control has been given away, as Deputy McDowell said. People working for the same newspaper do not necessarily read a Bill with the same intensity or they misinterpret it. It was amusing because if I am to be criticised, it should be because of the point made by Deputy McDowell.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that, even if one agreed with the Minister that a regulatory regime or ethical mandate should not be laid down for the investments, by having only one criterion, the commercial return, the Minister is preventing the commission from using its discretion on investments. No consideration other than the commercial return can be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Historically, one could name cases where international companies were involved in scandals. I will not name companies, but if one looks back over the past ten years, there have been scandals involving the manner in which international companies treated their workers and the environment and about how certain countries treated their citizens. Investment in their businesses or industries would have been deemed improper by many Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>What will happen in the future if the pension fund is invested in a company about which an enormous scandal emerges? For example, what would happen if it had an international operation in central Africa and there was clear evidence of a total degradation of workers, an abuse of fundamental human rights and the total exploitation of people, but the rate of return was very good? It appears the Minister has refined the mandate to the point where the commission could not pull the equity stake out of such a company unless it was sure it could invest that equity stake for a greater return elsewhere. This creates a difficulty because by not giving any wider mandate other than the commercial, the Minister is instructing the commission not to use its good sense.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 10, after &ldquo;pensions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but in any year, up to one quarter of the amount paid into the Fund in respect of that year may be paid by the Commission from the Fund to the Exchequer at the request of the Minister in respect of services other than future social welfare pensions and public service pensions, if and only if he or she is satisfied that to do so would not involve an actual or potential charge on public funds.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure I understood the strictures the Ceann Comhairle set out at the start of the debate. I presume that if I wander into certain <Col N="531" /> territory, I risk the amendments collapsing into disorder or being ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of my view on this matter and a similar view was articulated by Deputy Noonan. We must simply take into account the possibility that at some point in the next 25 years economic circumstances will change and that we may wish to make a smaller contribution to the fund, in any given year, than the 1% set out in the Bill. What we are seeking is a small measure of flexibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister often complains about his views being distorted by the media. I have had a similar experience in recent weeks with the assistance of some of the Minister's colleagues. I admit that the Minister was not involved but a number of his colleagues have been quick to accuse me of arguing in favour of raiding the fund. As the Minister is aware, I am merely seeking to provide that a relatively small measure of flexibility would be introduced to allow account to be taken of both the prevailing economic circumstances in any given year and the demographic projections to hand at any given time.</P>
    <P>In the past three or four years, during the debate on this matter, we have had the opportunity to consider changing demographic projections. I spoke to the Minister in private a few days ago in respect of a supplement that appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i>, which sets out in stark terms the contrast between the projected liability for Ireland and the liabilities for other European countries. Regardless of the demographic changes that occur and the burden that will evolve in this country during the next 25 years, it is clear that, in terms of GNP and relative affordability, we will still be faced with a much smaller pensions bill than any other EU or OECD country, irrespective of whether it is pegged to prices or earnings. All Deputy Noonan and I have been saying is that in order to take into account the need for flexibility, there should be a possibility to reduce the contribution in any given year to 0.75%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget strategy group that was established by my Department to consider the budgetary issues posed by ageing estimated that approximately 3.5% of gross national product would have to be set aside annually to equalise the Exchequer burden of health and pension costs during the next 50 years. However, given the magnitude of the prospective costs involved and the many other competing demands on the State's finances, the group concluded that a more feasible sum to set aside would be 1% of GNP, which it was estimated would meet approximately 30% of these costs. In making this recommendation, the group acknowledged that it was making no provision for the post-2056 situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives discretion to future Governments to extend the life of the fund beyond 2055. While our demographic projections do not go beyond 2056, when we estimate there will be one <Col N="532" /> retired person for every two persons of working age, it would be quite unrealistic to expect a quick decline in the ratio. The ageing problem will continue for some years at least and perhaps some decades after mid-century.</P>
    <P>In establishing a single reserve fund which is not designed to meet a defined liability but to part fund social welfare and public service pension costs to a year potentially beyond 2055, I decided to adhere to the recommendation of a contribution of 1% of GNP. This is at a level which will make a significant contribution to future pension costs and it is a sustainable commitment. Once built into the multi-annual budgetary structure, it should not cause undue difficulty.</P>
    <P>As stated on Second Stage, the contribution is slightly less than our annual contribution to the EU budget and less than one third of the interest payment on the national debt in 1999. If our economic circumstances make contributions over and above the 1% of GNP feasible, the Bill allows additional contributions to be made to the fund by way of resolution of Dáil Éireann. In effect, the 1% of gross national product is a minimum annual contribution to the fund and it is open to Governments to make an increased contribution in any particular year.</P>
    <P>Given the size of the pensions liability that is awaiting us and a projected increase of 7.7% of GNP on current levels by 2055 and in light of the fact that the fund will meet only part of this liability, I would be firmly opposed to any measure which lessened the 1% contribution to the fund. I do not accept that in earmarking 1% of gross national product for the fund the Government is in any way neglecting the current needs of our society. Contributions to the fund are not being made at the expense of other goals and commitments.</P>
    <P>As a result of our economic success, we are in the happy position of being able to pre-fund, within a sustainable budgetary strategy, which will also allow for substantial infrastructural and other capital investment under the national development plan, continuing implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, further improvements in public services and ongoing reduction in the national debt. In short, the economic success we have worked so hard to achieve and the demographic bonus we are currently enjoying allows us to make provision for future pension liabilities without compromising on our more immediate economic and societal goals.</P>
    <P>To allow discretion in the making of the 1% contribution in the manner envisaged by the amendment would significantly reduce the capacity of the fund to meet future pension liabilities. I need not remind the House of the straits in which prioritising short-term interests over the longer-term sustainability of the public finances has left us in the past. A contribution of 1% of GNP is a prudent and sustainable commitment and I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdrew a similar amendment in my name because we had an intensive debate on this matter on Committee Stage. However, it is interesting to look forward and try to project what might happen to the national finances. Obviously, one must base one's consideration of future developments on some assumptions. However, if we assume that growth rates will continue at between 5% and 6% in the future, it is possible to put 1% aside, continue to run budget surpluses, provide tax relief and spend the level of money on services which Members on all sides have been calling for in recent times. It does not take a great deal to go wrong before one's arithmetic is upset. One does not need to be an expert on econometrics to calculate what will happen to the national finances &ndash; one could do one's sums on the back of an envelope and one's answer would not be far wrong.</P>
      <P>If there was an isometric shock in the United States, if current trends on Wall Street and in the Nasdaq index were to continue, if the US economy entered a period of negative growth and interest rates were reduced to combat this and if the American business cycle entered an 18 month or two year period of bottoming out before beginning a slow climb, it is possible that growth in this country would not be maintained at between 5% and 6%. The Minister is aware that there is a risk of a wage explosion in the country at present. If I was in his shoes, that would be my primary fear.</P>
      <P>In light of tomorrow's rail strike, the six different industrial relations disputes in Aer Lingus and the fact that teachers will again go on strike this week, it is clear that the PPF is under pressure. If a public sector wage explosion occurred in this country and there was a downward trend towards the bottom of the business cycle in the United States, without any recession occurring here or in America and even with growth rates of 2% and 3%, one's projections for the future would turn out differently.</P>
      <P>It is against that background that Deputy McDowell and I are asking if it is prudent for the Minister to tie the hands of his successors. Would it not be appropriate to allow for discretion on the part of the Administration of the day in order that the amount to be dedicated to a pension fund would fall within a certain range?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is concerned that he will be replaced by an imprudent successor who, when times get bad, instead of raising taxes or cutting public expenditure will raid the fund or reduce the contribution to it. However, he made the point that any of his successors with a majority in the House will be able to introduce amending legislation if they do not want to invest money in the fund. There is a risk that this will happen in periods of great recession when there will be a shortage of funds for basic services. If, for example, one of the Minister's successors was faced with closing several hospitals, a great deal of pressure would be exerted to reduce the 1% contribution if it became clear that people would suffer. There might be a consensus at that point <Col N="534" /> to introduce amending legislation which would prevent money being invested in the fund for a number of years. If the discretion is put in place now, it is more likely that the 1% contribution will remain intact in the future.</P>
    <P>We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage and I will not delay the House. However, there is validity in the point Deputy McDowell and I made on Second and Committee Stages. We believe the Minister is taking a very rigid stand on this matter and that may not be the most prudent or wisest course of action.</P>

      <P>While listening to the Minister I was reminded of how blasé we have become about relatively large sums of money. For many years we were told by, among others, the Minister and his Department that the notion of contributing 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid was unthinkable, that to aim for such an imprecise amount of money was completely inconsistent with any notion of prudent budgeting in the future. Yet suddenly when things changed the notion of setting aside 1% of GNP for liabilities which will not arise for a quarter of a century&mdash;</P>

      <P>The figure is 0.35% and the Minister has to reach a figure of 0.45% before this time next year, which he will be lucky to achieve. However, that is another issue.</P>
      <P>The commitment made in terms of GNP is an imprecise amount and is much money. The Minister said that this does not have to be done at the expense of anything else. Given the budgetary circumstances, of course he is right &ndash; he can spend as much as he wants, cut taxes by a huge amount, set aside money for the national debt and future pension liabilities and probably buy up most of the land in north County Kildare. However, nobody thinks the budgetary situation will continue, and it certainly cannot continue into the indefinite future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Bill deals with long-term liabilities, we have an obligation to cast ourselves ten years into the future when there may be an isometric shock or some other difficulty in the economy. As the Bill is currently drafted, we could find ourselves in the bizarre situation where we have borrowed money at one rate of interest and put it into a fund where it is invested to earn a lower rate of interest. In straight economic terms this makes absolutely no sense, and the simple purpose of the amendment is to provide for a relatively small amount of flexibility in circumstances which are <Col N="535" /> different from the ones we find ourselves in today.</P>

      <P>It is not clear that the Minister will be accountable to the Dáil for the policy decisions made by the agency or the commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined during the debate on amendments Nos. 20 and 21, the independence of the commission is a cornerstone of the legislation. This is to enable the fund to generate returns in line with those achieved by private pension funds and to ensure that its investment strategy cannot be influenced by other policy considerations. Thus, I have deliberately ensured that the Minister for Finance does not have any right to give directions to the commissioners on the set of criteria to which they must adhere. The proposed amendment is not consistent with this approach. By making the Minister accountable to the Dáil for the matters set out in the report of the commission, it disturbs the arm's length relationships between the Minister and the commission. In this scenario the Minister would be forced to exercise much closer control over the activities of the commission than is provided for in the Bill and much of the discretion awarded to the commission under the Bill would be compromised.</P>
      <P>If the approach proposed in the amendment was adopted it would be necessary to further amend the Bill to enable the Minister to give directions and guidelines to the commission regarding its activities. Otherwise, the Minister would be accountable for activities over which he had no control. Such an approach runs counter to the basic philosophy underpinning the Bill and I must, therefore, reject it.</P>
      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage, Deputy Noonan asked whether the Minister could answer parliamentary questions on the fund. I said that I would answer questions on the overall performance of the fund. However, the accountability arrangements being put in place in the Bill provide that the chairperson of the commission is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of policy matters, while the chief executive or manager is accountable to the committee in respect of the accounts of the fund and other operational matters. Hence, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to answer questions on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Noonan asked if I would consider the possibility of bringing for<Col N="537" /> ward an amendment on Report Stage enshrining in statute the responsibility of the Minister to answer parliamentary questions on the overall performance of the fund. I considered this approach but do not think it would be an appropriate way to proceed. If one were to set out in the Bill the instances in which the Minister would answer parliamentary questions it would raise the question of why such an approach should not be adopted in legislation generally. I am satisfied that the accountability provisions outlined, the publication of the annual report of the commission and the commitments I have given that the Minister, as the owner of the fund under section 18(7), will answer questions on the overall performance of the fund are more than adequate to ensure that the management of the fund is conducted, and is seen to be conducted, in an accountable and transparent manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a consistency in the Minister's responses but I do not agree with it. He is, in effect, privatising the use of a huge chunk of taxpayers' funds. He is saying that he is not responsible for the administration of the fund, which I understand, or for policy, other than the one or two sentence provision set out in the Bill. This is not politically acceptable and I suspect it may be a legally doubtful way of dealing with taxpayers' money. I disagree fundamentally with the Minister on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation. There is general agreement on it but I wish to refer to a number of issues. It is important that industrial relations are discussed in the prevailing climate. It is well recognised throughout the EU and further afield that industrial relations in Ireland have been a major contributory factor to the economic climate we now enjoy. There is prosperity, a reduction in taxation, low interest rates, increased spending and a reduction in unemployment and social issues have been addressed. Social issues still remain but at least the industrial relations process allows Government, unions and employers to come together and formulate national agreements, the latest of which is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>As one looks back on recent years, it is important to acknowledge the need to be inclusive in negotiations. Bringing unions, employers and Government on board has been effective to date. However, some groups are seeking additional payments but that should be addressed under the PPF and the labour relations mechanisms which exist. I urge the ASTI, following its recent action, to come to the table and negotiate with the Labour Relations Commission using the industrial relations apparatus which is available.</P>
      <P>In the late 1970s and early 1980s Ireland experienced inflation and wage demand which spiralled and brought the country to its knees. If it were not for the foresight and vision of the 1987 Administration and unions we would not be here now talking about the Celtic tiger or the Celtic snail. One of the guiding principles that should be adopted and encouraged is the involvement of the unions, employers and the State as a triumvirate to ensure there is broad agreement on the parameters for tax reduction, public spending and social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation is to give new dispute settling powers to the Labour Court in cases where the employer has failed to follow agreed voluntary procedures, where negotiating procedures are not in place and collective bar<Col N="539" /> gaining is not taking place and where there has been no recourse to industrial action by the trade union or employees involved. In the past the Labour Court did not have enough powers to bring about a settlement as outlined in the explanatory memorandum and for that reason the legislation is timely and welcome.</P>
    <P>I am 32 years old and I believe we owe a great deal of gratitude to those who brought about industrial harmony from 1987 onwards. That must be acknowledged. I am concerned that with the passage of time there are people who do not remember the dark old days when a graduate left college and had two choices, to go on social welfare or get on an aeroplane. It is important to recognise that industrial harmony is one of the pillars on which the Celtic tiger is built. If that is forgotten economists and other experts are agreed that the process of economic development, social inclusiveness and reducing taxes could easily come to an end.</P>
    <P>Section 2 prescribes the conditions under which the Labour Court can carry out an investigation and enables the court to investigate accepted bodies defined under section 6(3) of the Trade Union Act, 1941, that can carry out negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment. There was a slight deficit up to now in this area of the industrial relations armoury and the Bill acknowledges and addresses that issue.</P>
    <P>I hope centralised bargaining will continue where the Government and the social partners can come together and draw up an industrial plan. The announcement of the £40 billion national development plan demonstrates that we can plan well in advance for the future if there are good, positive industrial relations. A cohesive forward-thinking vision for Ireland is capable of being produced but if the PPF is undermined and disintegrates I fear the worst.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Government has taken on board the concerns of the unions and employers in formulating the upcoming budget. However, there is concern among trade union representatives about inflation. People on fixed social welfare benefits are also concerned and they must be a priority.</P>
    <P>The present industrial relations apparatus has served Ireland well and the legislation tightens certain areas which heretofore were difficult to address. The partnership approach has been successful and should continue to be supported by all involved. There will be confrontations, disputes and arguments but they should be addressed in the industrial relations process. Ireland's economy is booming and relations between unions and employers is one factor which is investigated by people who wish to invest in Ireland. That was a major factor in the huge inward investment here from 1987 onwards.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt if negotiations and relations between the unions, employers and Government break down there will be a flight of capital and a <Col N="540" /> lack of inward investment, which is another pillar on which the booming economy has been founded. We should be conscious of encouraging everybody to be inclusive in their approach to the industrial relations process.</P>
    <P>The legislation is brief and it has been debated at length in the Seanad. I welcome it and wish it a speedy passage through the House. I hope the Bill when enacted will address the problems regarding dispute settling powers for the Labour Court and people will be able to use this mechanism to address their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which gives us an opportunity to reflect on what has been achieved through social partnership, the challenges that confront the present partnership agreement and how effective is existing industrial relations machinery. If one examines the level of discontent, some of which has already manifested itself in strike action while other groups appear to be rushing headlong in that direction, one must be concerned at the potential of the partnership arrangements to survive the current crises.</P>
      <P>Social partnership was originally conceived in the late 1980s and, as it embraced all the social partners, including the Government and the Opposition, it achieved economic stability and enabled us to step back from the brink of economic disaster upon which the country was poised at that stage. While we can see all around us the benefits which have flowed from it, there is a feeling that some have benefited more than others. Those who are not employed in the cutting edge of industrial technology and in high technology areas, such as information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals etc. certainly feel their worth has been questioned in terms of the capacity of social partnership to deliver a meaningful wage to them.</P>
      <P>It is not so much the level of wages which matters any longer as what those wages can achieve now for people as compared to what they could achieve a relatively short time ago. I refer specifically to the issue of housing. Taking the teachers' strike as an indication of this, the starting wage for teaching of £15,000 is not exorbitant and moves slowly up the wage scale as years pass. However, a relatively short number of years ago a teacher was rarely found on a local authority housing waiting list. Now teachers throughout the country and others in similar occupations &ndash; what would have been euphemistically referred to as permanent and pensionable posts &ndash; are being included on local authority waiting lists because they can no longer put a roof over their heads.</P>
      <P>The Government stands indicted on its failure to make any meaningful intervention in the provision of housing for people on average incomes. The Minister of State is shaking his head but if he suggests the Government has made efforts, I point out to him the reality that, since the Government came to office, houses have doubled in price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will relate this point to industrial relations. If the Acting Chairman was listening to my introduction to the point about teachers' salaries, he would see it is related. My point is that many people, such as teachers, gardaí and nurses, who deliver an integral service to a functioning society, have been priced out of the housing market. That is fuelling the industrial unrest we see in areas outside the information technology, biotechnology and pharmaceutical areas of employment.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to be more proactive. We have seen numerous instances of excessive profiteering in the building industry, where phase one goes on sale today and, in three weeks' time, phase two is sold off paper drawings for £30,000 more than the first phase but, because of the basic economic principles of supply and demand, these additional prices can be commanded. That is fuelling enormous discontent among professions integral to a successful economy.</P>
      <P>I accept the difficulty the Government has in negotiating with the ASTI because it is outside the partnership arrangement. Perhaps on reflection, people will come to the conclusion that the steps taken by the ASTI may have been rather hasty. However, they are understandable. Looking at the overall ballot of teachers, including the INTO and the TUI, a majority would not have voted in favour of the partnership arrangement. Given that it is not the most militant group in society, significant straws in the wind are being shown which we would be foolish to neglect.</P>
      <P>We could learn many lessons in an appropriate time if we were to look at what happened in the nursing profession and compare it with what may happen in the teaching area. We established a nursing commission and it proved to be the foundation for resolving the disputes in that area and came up with many worthwhile solutions. I urge the Government to establish a commission on education to examine the range of issues involved in the teachers' dispute, not just salary issues. It should involve the structure of the profession and the voluntary aspect to the delivery of teachers' duties.</P>
      <P>We should try to head off a crisis which is coming down the tracks, namely, recruiting people into the teaching profession. For example, there is only one science graduate in the H. Dip. in UCC this year. That means there will be one new graduate teaching mathematics and science subjects next year. That will manifest itself in a few years in class and subject choice in secondary schools throughout the country. It will be too late then and we will be travelling the world looking for qualified teachers as we do now for nurses. We should take appropriate steps now to prevent the necessity for fire brigade action later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission on education to examine the overall structure in teaching, the career oppor<Col N="542" /> tunities it provides and the salary issue, which is integral, might in some way be the sweetener to enable the ASTI to get off a hook on which it has placed itself in terms of the strike action upon which it has embarked. The ASTI has never been known as the most militant of teaching unions and the fact that it has seen fit to take this course of action is something we should not ignore lightly.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in so far as it goes but it does not deal with the inadequacy of the industrial relations machinery to deal with strikes such as that by teachers with which the Government is now faced. It begs the question whether partnership requires a legal framework and whether representative bodies, such as the ICTU, which sign into an arrangement on behalf of their membership, should be legally bound by it. Likewise, if the social partners are to be legally bound by it, so too should the State in terms of the arrangements agreed upon. That might head off some of the current discontent on the part of those within and without the partnership arrangement.</P>
    <P>Throughout the economy, from the train strike which is before the Labour Court &ndash; it appears there will be a two day stoppage &ndash; to Ryanair pilots going on strike, to Aer Lingus caterers and clerical staff&mdash;</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to Aer Lingus pilots, groups are queuing up to take industrial action. It appears the Government in response to these issues is introducing legislation which will not have one iota of an effect on any of those disputes or the capacity to resolve them. In terms of those outside the partnership arrangement, a mechanism will have to be found to resolve this dispute and it will take negotiation. While both sides may shout at each other, the only losers in any dispute will be consumers, students in schools, public transport users and air transport users. The Government will have to begin negotiations with these groups to bring about a resolution to these problems.</P>
      <P>Housing is a huge issue in terms of unrest because people see that something their predecessors in the same profession were comfortably able to attain is now well beyond their grasp. Given current levels of inflation and the concentration of tax relief by the Government in previous budgets to excessively favour those on high incomes, that level of discontent and distrust is understandable. I urge the Government to focus future tax reliefs on those who are feeling the financial squeeze, particularly due to house prices. The Government should also examine the existing industrial relations machinery to see if there is a case for a legal framework for partnership, so that if ICTU, the farmers or IBEC sign up to such an agreement they would be honour bound by it. It should not be something that people can walk away from once a chill wind comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> How adequate, or inadequate, is the industrial relations machinery for dealing with groups that are currently outside its terms? The current difficulties highlight the inadequacy of the machinery. For example, we cannot talk to the ASTI because, if we did, it would invite others in similar circumstances to step outside the terms of the agreement. Does that mean, however, that we must continue to ignore all ASTI members on strike, as well as all the students studying for examinations who are most immediately and seriously affected?</P>
    <P>It is evident that the industrial relations machinery is not adequate and that should be acknowledged. While the Bill deals with an inadequacy, it does not deal with the real issues causing industrial unrest. In so far as it sets out to solve a specific problem, however, it probably provides an adequate framework for doing that alone.</P>
    <P>I am sure we will return to the debate in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this much neglected but important Bill. As the Member opposite indicated, the legislation allows us the time and space to reflect on the interesting industrial relations environment in which we find ourselves. The Bill will go a long way towards helping the voluntary character of what is involved. I was intrigued by the previous speaker's suggestion of some form of legal framework within which to incorporate the understandings, compromises and agreements arrived at through the partnership process. It is important, however, not to think purely in terms of that process. Some years ago I was the first to criticise opponents of the partnership process, not least those on the Fine Gael benches, including Deputy John Bruton who was one of its foremost critics in Opposition. Although I am not suggesting that I agreed with them, there was some validity to the criticisms proposed by some opponents of the process. One of the most startling facts that is rarely referred to in debates is that 1.2 million people in the workforce are not members of trade unions. Some 500,000 workers, however, are represented by trade unions both in the public and private sectors. In the context of the Bill, the figures amply illustrate the need for some form of protection for employees or employers who, in the event of an irreconcilable dispute, when there is a need for intervention and agreement, find themselves in enterprises that are not covered by a collective agreement on pay and conditions. It is good to see that both the ICTU and IBEC have agreed that this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt that the provisions of the Bill will be invoked too often. We have seen some spectacular cases, however, not least the baggage handling dispute at Dublin Airport, which involved an illegal picket outside the framework for legal intervention. Where there is no voluntary approach for resolving a dispute, the legislation <Col N="544" /> will, I hope, allow the Labour Court to become involved, as well as making mandatory regulations for resolving such disputes. That is a healthy situation. I was disillusioned by the behaviour of trade unions concerning the baggage handling dispute at Dublin Airport some time ago. I felt that an illegal action had been allowed to occur and, in effect, the State was powerless to do anything for commuters whose travel plans had been disrupted.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legislation, we also need to examine the task force that was set up to deal with industrial action, including strikes, in essential services. We should be striving to avoid all strikes and lock-outs concerning essential services so that they can be maintained. Most people would be horrified at the thought that emergency hospital care could be discontinued, yet that is technically possible within our legislative provisions for industrial relations. It has happened in other countries but thankfully it has not happened here to date. It is a technical possibility, though, and should be acted upon. It is imperative for the State to ensure the continuation of essential services for citizens, which some would regard as a basic right, irrespective of the state of play that can sometimes develop in the ongoing industrial relations war.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes some way towards resolving disputes that might otherwise be irreconcilable due to the inability of invoking formal structures for resolution. In the past few years four landmark disputes have occurred, which say so much about industrial relations procedures and tell their own stories. They are the nurses' dispute, the baggage handlers' dispute, to which I have referred, the train drivers' dispute and the current teachers' dispute. The baggage handlers and train drivers are unique in the sense that they can take disputes outside the legislative framework and apparently go unpunished while continuing to disrupt the economy. The nurses and teachers disputes raise different issues concerning the perception that public sector pay rates are falling behind those in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, when Mr. Charlie Lennon gave an interview to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, he could not identify a specific issue other than the 30% the secondary teachers were seeking. He spoke volubly about the costs his members faced in seeking to obtain mortgages, but this problem is not unique to teachers. Almost everybody in society finds it hard to get a loan to purchase their home. As the previous speaker said, it is a very serious problem, but not one that is unique to public sector workers. It affects private sector workers also.</P>
    <P>Public sector employees sometimes have a misconception of the levels of pay that operate in the private sector. They seem to feel that anybody who works in private industry is making huge gains. Of course, surveys by the Small Firms Association have suggested that over the past few years there have been increases of 8% for those working in the private sector, particularly with <Col N="545" /> smaller companies. Such workers do not have the security of tenure that people in the public sector enjoy, however.</P>
    <P>If one examines the post-1987 partnership process, one will find that teachers have done extraordinarily well, as have civil servants in the public sector generally. At a time when the economy was not at its strongest, public sector workers had their pay increases maintained, albeit on an incremental basis. That is the reality concerning public sector workers and the figures are there to prove it. The public sector has done very well out of the partnership process. It can be argued that they have done disproportionately well if one looks at the corresponding gains in the private sector. In the past year or two, certain segments in the private sector may have gained exponentially because of an acute skills shortage in the economy. If one is lucky enough to be in the kind of private sector employment which is experiencing skills shortages, one is in a position to make an exponential gain.</P>
    <P>A shortage of skilled workers, coupled with a lack of proper roads and housing, is not a justification for a massive pay increase in the public sector. It is a recipe for something else, perhaps radical action in all those areas to provide housing and infrastructure. Eaten bread is soon forgotten. The extent to which pay and conditions in the public sector were maintained through the bad years leading in to the good years has been forgotten. It has also been forgotten by the participants in the teachers' dispute that the benchmarking body is the vehicle through which there can be a restructuring of the teaching profession in terms of pay.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, which partly reflects the success of the trade unions, which have always preferred to accept incremental increases, rather than opt for profit sharing or bigger gains which could be made in separating segments of workers. Instead of accepting a general increase, trade unions in the civil and public service in particular could be better off in promoting merit pay, the idea that those with a lifelong commitment to the service should receive bonuses and increments equivalent to those payable in the private sector when they do their job well and are properly assessed under a benchmarking system. The benchmarking body will do precisely this.</P>
    <P>In the nurses dispute, when a huge increase was sought, ordinary nurses who were of the view that their status had been reduced for much the same reasons as teachers &ndash; the price of housing and the fact that in their perception people whom they knew were doing much better in the private sector &ndash; seemed to realise at the end of the day that through the many recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the creation of new grades and opportunities they could move away from the culture of the long service increment, the idea that one has to wait 20 to 30 years before reaching the top of one's scale or being promoted late in life, when one is not as enthusiastic, to a pensionable position which carries a very large <Col N="546" /> salary at the end of one's days having been forced to live through a period when a smaller salary applied. This is killing the civil and public service by discouraging young people with talent and ability from joining.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that our teachers are among the highest paid in Europe. They are not lowly paid. Because our standard of living has risen so high, particularly in relation to housing, they have found it very difficult to keep pace with events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputies for their contributions to which I listened with great interest. The Bill is the result of an agreed approach by IBEC, the ICTU, Departments and agencies on how to deal with disputes where negotiating arrangements are not in place. Such a consensus has eluded the social partners for many years and successive Governments had rightly resisted the temptation to impose a solution in the absence of a common approach between employers and trade unions. It is in keeping with the best tradition of social partnership that representatives of IBEC and the ICTU have succeeded in devising a balanced formula that takes account of the different views brought to the table.</P>
      <P>Whether we call the parties who devised this approach a high level group or a committee is neither here nor there. The parties primarily concerned with disputes, over the right to bargain, have agreed on a process which they are prepared to operate. They have asked us to underpin this with legislation. That is what we are doing in the Bill. It is wise that the application in practice of the legislation will be monitored by the parties during the next few years. They are committed to this. What has emerged is significant. For the first time we have a procedure which cannot be ignored by a recalcitrant employer. At the end of the process such an employer must comply with an enforcement order from the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore noted, the only avenue open to a trade union is under section 20 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. While the trade union must undertake to accept the Labour Court's recommendation in advance, no such obligation rests with the employer. Deputy Rabbitte underscored that there are limits set by case law and the Constitution in this area. While I accept that the legislation may not serve as a panacea for all disputes, it does respect the voluntarist tradition which enjoyed cross-party support from those who contributed to the debate, including Deputies Creed and Lenihan. The legislation provides an avenue for workers to have their cases heard and their grievances or claims for pay and conditions aired. Uniquely, a mechanism is being introduced which allows claims on pay and conditions to be processed to a legally binding award in the event of a refusal by an employer to engage in agreed procedures or where an employer does so in bad faith. In place of the <Col N="547" /> blank wall of section 20 where the employer chooses to ignore the Labour Court recommendation, it provides a route which employees can exploit.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the pressures and tensions in the economy which have led some to call into question the partnership approach. There are major problems ahead, despite the progress made in the past decade. The challenge of managing our new economy is considerable for all &ndash; Government, Parliament and the public alike &ndash; but one thing is clear: the way to address problems about the delivery of social services and the development of infrastructure is not by returning to the old ways of doing business, but by deepening the partnership approach involving shifts in attitudes, behaviour and culture. We have achieved our present progress by adopting new approaches and processes, by changing the way we did things in the past. This is as true for the matter before us today as it is of the treatment of more macro issues of maintaining our competitiveness in a global environment.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to pay and inflation. This is a cause of concern for us all. A large component of our inflation problem is caused by factors over which we have no control, namely, oil and the value of the euro. Both of these external pressures are likely to moderate and the outlook is for a significant reduction in the rate of inflation next year. The Government will not be relying solely on the abatement of pressure from these external factors. The national budget next month gives us the opportunity to help bring inflation back under control. We will avail of that opportunity. Moreover, within the past few days, there has been a progress report on discussions between the employers and the ICTU on the problems caused by inflation. I welcome the progress made. There is clear evidence of the desire to resolve the difficulties which have arisen, to reinforce the operation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and to strengthen social partnership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the issue of the rights of foreign workers. During Question Time on 12 October in response to a parliamentary question from the same Deputy on the Employment Agency Act, 1971, the issue of the rights of foreign workers in Ireland under our employment legislation was raised. The House was assured that foreign workers receive the same protection as Irish workers under employee protection legislation. If anyone is aware of any discrimination against non-nationals in the workplace in so far as employment legislation is concerned, I urge them to come forward with this information. Such breaches of employment rights legislation will be fully investigated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>On the various comments on the Aer Lingus dispute, it should be remembered that Aer Lingus encountered very difficult trading problems in <Col N="548" /> recent years. It was necessary for management to address these difficulties to secure the future of the company. The Cahill plan was accepted with difficulty by the various groupings within the Aer Lingus workforce. Management has acknowledged that legitimate claims exist. These claims are under discussion. We are pleased that clerical officers have this evening accepted the recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The ILDA dispute to which Deputies Ring and Broughan referred imposed unnecessary hardship on the travelling public. The issue of representation had been the subject of a High Court judgment in April which found against the ILDA. This judgment was the subject of an appeal hearing in the Supreme Court last week and judgment was reserved.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, stated that he deliberately refrained from bringing forward legislation that was opposed by either trade unions or employers. The formula of the high level group reaffirms the consensus that exists on all sides to voluntarism as the preferred approach to dispute resolution. I am pleased Deputy Rabbitte agrees with the voluntarist nature of our industrial relations machinery and I agree with his remark that unless there is a very good reason &ldquo;he is not in favour of further or ongoing legislative intervention&rdquo;. The consensus approach we now have on a mechanism for processing pay and conditions to legally binding conclusion in situations where the voluntary process fails is a good reason.</P>
    <P>What ICTU and IBEC have agreed and asked the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to give effect to in this legislation is a fall-back mechanism which addresses a procedural deficit that can arise, and has arisen, in a small number of cases where an employer refuses to engage in the voluntary process. I hope the remaining Stages of the Bill can be swiftly processed by the House and I thank Members for their co-operation.</P>

      <P>This Government seems to delude itself that it can camouflage its managerial incompetence by throwing many millions, indeed billions, at various infrastructural problems without examining or addressing the issues which are causing such problems, without tackling the fundamental reforms needed to guarantee long-term stability or quality service or without confronting strong vested interests. The result is that an economy, rescued from the doldrums by a unique social and political consensus, is quickly going down the tubes because of the Government's fear and reluctance to take difficult decisions to keep the vital infrastructure of the economy on track.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that in the week the Minister for Finance announced a record £18 billion budget spend no mainline trains were running, leaving 50,000 passengers stranded at rail stations throughout the country. Aer Lingus pickets paraded once again outside the State capital's airport and the Government's failure to tackle the taxi issue in Dublin led to a frenetic and hysterical backlash by the taxi owning monopoly with threats of street revolt if their Supreme Court challenge to liberalisation is unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>If one deliberately set out to create transport chaos across public transport, one could scarcely make a better job of it than the different Ministers responsible for the overall management of the nation's transport, particularly the Minister for Public Enterprise who is the main shareholder in the State utilities. She presides over one of the pivotal Departments of Government, a Department around which so much of the economy and so much of society revolves and depends. For the past three years and three months, she has had the ownership of CIE, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. In that time she has stood idly by as the industrial relations atmosphere within these State utilities went from bad to worse.</P>
      <P>For three years and three months she witnessed strikes, go slows and working to rule which led to wholesale disruption, the withdrawal of services and traffic congestion. Instead of taking the initiative and showing leadership in a determination to sort out the internal problems of the different companies in which she is the sole stakeholder, the Minister frittered away her time with a series of promises, recycled announcements and photocalls. If there was any good news, which was unfortunately a rarity, the Minister was highly visible and more than willing to claim the laurels. When there was bad news, unfortunately all too often, she became a disinterested spectator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recurring theme of this evening's motion is that of Government failure, the first of which is the failure to provide an adequate number of taxis in Dublin. For three and a quarter years, this Government has been confronted with this problem &ndash; growing queues, long delays, lack of taxi numbers, young people unable to get home <Col N="551" /> and set upon and beaten viciously while having to walk home late at night. Enter the Taoiseach with the establishment of the taxi forum. The forum recommended 1,000 extra licences. What emerged, however, was an incredibly stupid capitulation to the taxi lobby, 2,700 new licences to be given to 2,700 existing licence holders thereby copperfastening the stranglehold of the existing monopoly. Thanks to the courts, not the Government, the taxi service is now to be liberalised, as Fine Gael has long advocated.</P>
    <P>Second is the failure to introduce bus competition. The private bus operators have had a dramatic and positive impact on the inter-urban bus market. That has been good for the private operators who have grasped the market opportunities presented, good for the consumer who enjoys the cost advantage of choice and good for Bus Éireann which has risen to the challenge of competition. However, the glaring need for bus competition in Dublin, where competition, choice and service is really needed, has been ignored.</P>
    <P>The third failure was the failure to introduce long promised integrated ticketing. A well integrated transport system makes it easier for travellers to get to their final destination. In a location such as Dublin, where there is a major need to persuade driver only car users to switch to public transport, integrated ticketing would be a key inducement. The cost is minimal, the advantages and attractions are obvious but it has not happened. That is another inexcusable failure.</P>
    <P>Failure number four is the failure to provide late night bus services. Every weekend thousands of citizens are left stranded on the streets of Dublin, vainly seeking transport home. It is wrong that almost the entire fleet of public transport buses, representing millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, are locked behind the high gates of the Donnybrook, Clontarf and other garages while the public is left high and dry or cold and wet on the streets of Dublin. It has been beyond the capacity of the Minister for Public Enterprise to use her influence for the public good to get the buses onto the streets to bring the travelling public home safely at night.</P>
    <P>Fifth is the failure to deliver the full complement of quality bus corridors. On 30 September 1998, the Dublin traffic action plan promised 11 quality bus corridors. In November 2000 only four of the 11 QBCs have come on stream even though the managing director of Bus Átha Cliath says the existing four QBCs have cut journey times by up to 40% and increased passenger numbers by 150%. Where are the other QBCs?</P>
    <P>Sixth is the failure to introduce the long promised park and ride facilities. Park and ride is an established regime, a successful method of eliminating and disentangling city centre traffic chaos. Its merits have been lauded as having particular relevance to Dublin. As we face 2001, nothing has happened and gridlock continues to rule.</P>
    <P>The seventh failure is the failure to construct the ready to roll Luas which the Government <Col N="552" /> inherited from the rainbow Government. In June 1997, everything was in place, routes had been identified, the planning process was under way, Government funding had been committed and EU funding had been agreed &ndash; it was all systems go. Instead of proceeding with the project the Minister began redrafting and redrawing. More consultant reports were commissioned. Finally, on 2 October, there was yet another unveiling. This time it was a £14 billion extravaganza &ndash; the DTO revised strategy, a mix of Luas and metro, underground and overground, a labyrinth of lines running here, there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>We are told it is the Government's long-term vision for Dublin transport. It is indeed long-term &ndash; the completion date is 2016. Dublin in 2000 is choking to death; by 2016 it will be paralysed. At the same time the Luas light rail system was approved by the rainbow Government the authorities in Montpellier in France approved a similar system. Today, Montpelier is fully operational while Luas is still a concept on a drawing board with hardly a sod turned.</P>
    <P>Failure No. 8 is the failure to bring into service the new Dart carriages. Dart carriages are packed way beyond capacity and above safety level day in, day out. New Dart carriages have been lying idle in cold storage since early 1999 and have not been brought into service. What other Minister for Public Enterprise, who is the monopoly shareholder in a company, would have allowed 18 months to elapse before sitting down with those involved, identifying the difficulties and resolving them, to ensure the new rolling stock that is urgently needed is brought on stream? The same unwillingness or failure to act and the same industrial relations paralysis has been responsible for stymieing the extension of the Dart services to Greystones and Malahide, and all the while Dublin chokes to death.</P>
    <P>Failure No. 9 is the failure to provide a satisfactory standard of customer service at Dublin Airport. The word &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; is an understatement. Dublin Airport is a mess and it has been for some time. The Minister is the major shareholder in Aer Rianta which operates Dublin Airport. The new terminal was to be the answer to Dublin Airport's problems. It was designed and constructed without consultation with its two main users, Aer Lingus and Ryanair. The design is wrong, hence the stand-off and the refusal by either company to use the new facility.</P>
    <P>In May 1997, Aer Rianta objected to the construction of the second terminal at Dublin Airport and lodged an objection with Fingal County Council. The objection stated, &ldquo;when in place, the present airport site will have adequate capacity to accommodate progressive traffic growth to 14 million passengers per annum, sufficient to meet all the traffic needs up to the year 2005&rdquo;. By December this year, that 14 million passenger figure will have been exceeded, five years ahead of anticipation. Most other capital cities are proud of their airports, but that is not the case with Dublin Airport where passengers <Col N="553" /> experience long queues, chaos, disorganisation and disruption. What other capital city airport would keep business people sitting in a plane on the tarmac for up to one hour waiting for the facilities to disembark?</P>
    <P>When the Minster intervened, she blundered badly. She announced, with some fanfare, in September that she had found the solution to Dublin Airport's overcrowding problem &ndash; Dublin Airport was to become a fully co-ordinated airport. She was clearly pushed into that announcement by Aer Rianta to cover for its mismanagement. What Aer Rianta did not tell her was that slot co-ordination is used anywhere in the world only where there is a problem with runway capacity. The problem at Dublin Airport is not runway capacity, it is gates, piers and terminals.</P>
    <P>Failure No. 10 is the failure to resolve any of the five industrial relations disputes within Aer Lingus, which continue to cause ongoing disruption for the travelling public. Over the past five weeks it has been one litany of industrial action after the other. Baggage handlers have withdrawn their services intermittently causing widespread disruption and delays. The strike by cabin crews grounded all Aer Lingus flights for a full day. Clerical staff withdrew their services two weeks ago, grounding, delaying and disrupting flights. Last Wednesday catering staff, members of SIPTU, picketed the airport all day. Aer Lingus pilots are seeking wage increases of up to £80,000 to bring them into line with their peers in the One World Alliance. Their industrial action in refusing to work holidays to facilitate the company will intensify and progressively hit flight schedules at the Christmas peak period. As of now the five separate disputes are still ongoing. None has been resolved and, in essence, that means the entire Aer Lingus workforce is in dispute with the company and the Minister, yet this was the company in which the Minister announced her intention to sell her 95% shareholding. One must ask what investor in his or her right mind would buy a single share from the Minister after the Eircom débâcle? What investors would even contemplate buying into the chaos that is Aer Lingus at present?</P>
    <P>Failure No. 11 is the failure to resolve any of the industrial disputes at Iarnród Éireann. One must welcome the success of the Labour Court in achieving a deferral of the Dart strike scheduled for yesterday morning. One must ask, however, is it a case that the strike has been abandoned or simply postponed. My information is that what was agreed is simply a short-term measure that will keep the lid on the situation for a very limited period, but that the difficult issues have not been resolved. When one considers the performance of Iarnród Éireann, one would be forgiven for believing that the company and some of its staff are hell bent on self-destruction.</P>
    <P>Permanent way workers paralysed the entire rail system earlier this year. For ten weeks the Minister sat on her hands and did not say or do anything while ILDA, on the one hand, and <Col N="554" /> SIPTU and NRBU, on the other, glared and growled at each other across the airwaves. The Minister, the LRC and the Labour Court would not intervene because it was deemed to be an internal industrial relations dispute. For ten weeks rail services to the west and south-west were suspended. The tourism peak season was destroyed. IFI in Arklow had to close. Finally after ten weeks the Labour Court and the LRC, both allegedly up to then unable to intervene, got involved in dealing with different aspects of the ILDA dispute and the strike was called off. The action that should have been taken on day one was needlessly and damagingly postponed for ten weeks because of the Minister's prevarication and indecisiveness. She is extremely lucky she does not have another controversy on her hands by virtue of the leaking from the LRC of a very sensitive document &ndash; if it was added to or was simply an LRC spin &ndash; to a Sunday newspaper on what has emerged regarding ILDA's contention on rail safety. The Minister appears to display an indifference to the national rail line service as against the Dart, when one contrasts her speedy intervention to save the Dart service this week with her lethargy in terms of intervening during the ILDA dispute.</P>
    <P>Failure No. 12 is the failure to get involved, to adopt a hands on approach or to realise in time what was happening regarding the cost overrun of £25 million on the mini-CTC signalling system to which I will return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have outlined 12 areas of public transport where failure has been the order of the day. Each was an area where the Government had a key managerial role. Never in the history of the State has there been such chaos simultaneously. We are not asking for the impossible. We simply ask for a reliable taxi service and we do not have that, a good train service and we do not have that and a stable industrial relations climate in the State's airlines and we certainly do not have that. The Minister for the Public Service has not performed. She should be moved, and she should be moved now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to the area of transport, having been immersed in issues of housing and environmental policy, only to find that the problems I witnessed during the past two and a half years under the tenure of the Minister have got much worse. That is a common symptom. I agree with the last sentiment expressed by Deputy Higgins that perhaps now is the time for the Minister to move on to lighter pastures, horticulture, perhaps a spell in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates: -</NameTxt>
      <P>or somewhere that would be less taxing on our commuters. Her band aid solutions, her finger in the dyke, all her quick fixes are now reaping a whirlwind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had debates like this before where a rabbit was pulled out of the hat and no doubt the <Col N="555" /> Minister will pull a rabbit out of the hat tonight regarding integrated ticketing. I remember the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, saying that the taxi problem had been solved with the issuing of 3,100 plates, yet a year later the problem is even worse.</P>
    <P>The truth is that all of this was predictable. An extra 6,000 new cars per week are being registered. There has been record growth in commuting in the greater Dublin area. The unplanned housing crisis, sprawling into Wicklow, Kildare, even as far as Wexford, and into Meath, has resulted in a colossal increase in the number of cars on our roads.</P>
    <P>The only solution is a modal shift to a high quality public transport system. The structural elements required for that are a greater Dublin transport authority, a new liberalised transport regime and a greatly increased public transport subsidy. This issue has been analysed to death for 20 years. The solutions have been put forward, yet none of those major reforms, which other capitals and major cities all over Europe have resolved, has been put in place by the Minister. There is no better example than the Luas. She inherited a ready-to-go situation regarding Luas. I accept it was modest. It included a line to Tallaght, the Dundrum line, which would meet the specific needs of the people living along that line, but we had to have the Atkins report. Everything was put on hold. When we received it, the Government did not like Atkins's recommendations and decided to opt for a grandiose plan, including a tunnel, which we still do not have and we do not even know how much it will cost. We were told it would cost £400 million or so extra. Not satisfied with that, after another year and a half of procrastination, we had to go with a Mitsui metro proposal, yet today we are no nearer to having an airport link or a metro and people are told they will have to wait until 2016. The public's patience has run out.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the taxi issue. We must grasp this nettle. It is similar to the pub licence issue in Dublin. Unfortunately, vested interests cannot overrule consumer requirements. Supply and demand is in such imbalance that we must increase the number of taxis drastically. This is a political issue, let us make no mistake about it. The Dublin local authorities were ready to make a decision on the matter when this Dáil formed. However, we had to stop and have a taxi forum. With all the machinations since then the queues have grown longer and the patience of the public has evaporated. I have heard arguments from Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern, who had election logos plastered all over taxis on the north side of Dublin, that this is a straightforward political issue of choice and whether one puts the consumer first.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell deregulated the haulage industry when I first entered the Dáil in 1981. At that time people had haulage plates on their mantelpieces which were worth £3,000 per week. Deputy Mitchell and that Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition deregulated that industry. Anyone of good repute could get a licence if he or she <Col N="556" /> had a proper vehicle. If I set up a launderette, a newspaper shop, a hairdressing salon&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A bookie's shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or a bookie's shop and I invest £80,000 in it and if someone sets up another such shop beside me or if there is a plethora of such shops, then that is the market. We live in a market economy. The taxi and pub sectors in Dublin will have to wake up to the real market because we cannot falsely sustain an uncompetitive situation. Given that all else has failed, deregulation is the only way forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for proper housing density on transport corridors, proper spatial plans, road planning and traffic management but Deputy Dempsey has not shown the remotest interest in any of these issues for which he has direct responsibility. Hence we are left with Mammy, the Minister for Public Enterprise, who comes forward with the same argument, saying, &ldquo;But for the record of the last Government .&rdquo; and that she is one or two committees or consultants away from action. The public-private partnerships, which are to deliver some of the major infrastructural projects in Dublin, cannot see the light of day because I am told the blueprints and designs are not in place.</P>
      <P>This problem will get much worse. The projected growth in population and change in demographics, migration to the east coast and growth in the labour force along with commuting needs and lack of a spatial plan mean we are going to be reduced to walking pace in Dublin for extensive periods of the morning and evening. The failure of this Government will take a number of years to resolve.</P>
      <P>We have proposed following the Copenhagen model of public transport, with heavy subsidies, and we have proposed properly regulated competition for rail and road as well as integrated transport. Whatever rabbits are pulled out of the hat tonight, the public will not wear it. It realises that the only solution is a general election and a change of Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not put out my horns as effectively as the Minister. The Minister knows this is not the first Private Members' motion on traffic and it will not be the last. All that has changed since our last debate is that the traffic has become worse. The tragedy is that we know it will go on getting worse until it reaches total paralysis, when Dublin will no longer be a viable entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not exaggerating. This is not scaremongering or political hype but is inevitable <Col N="557" /> unless the Government does something about it very soon. How bad does it have to get before the Government takes notice? How long must average commuting times become before they are regarded as unacceptable? How much earlier will we have to get up in the morning to beat the traffic? How long before social and family life in Dublin is destroyed? To say the Government has adopted a snail-like approach to traffic is to insult a snail; at least a snail has direction and purpose but the Government has neither. It would appear to prefer to allow Dublin slide into total chaos rather than confronting the problem and it has concentrated instead on something it is very good at &ndash; conflict avoidance, whether that is with the taxi industry, the CIE unions or the traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>The Government will not take hard decisions and will not take on vested interests. I acknowledge that the snail put its horns out this morning in response to the Fine Gael traffic campaign, when the Minister announced approval for integrated ticketing. Some of my colleagues suggested we should go out on the streets every morning if we get that kind of rapid response but I confess to being sceptical. I have heard announcements before from the Minister, who never misses an opportunity to make announcements or wear a hard hat. When I hear the delivery date is long after even the Taoiseach's prediction for the next election I am even more sceptical that this will be delivered but I nevertheless welcome the plan for integrated ticketing.</P>
    <P>We know what the problem is. We know the demand for peak time travel in Dublin is set to rise from 250,000 people two years ago to 500,000 in a few years and we know that public transport must be increased by almost a factor of five to cope with that demand. We know we have a DTO plan which the Minister says will bring relief in 2016. Perhaps it will but I do not care about 2016. I care about tomorrow, next month and next year. Unless the Government finds a way to move people and goods now and in the next few years, by 2016 the Dublin for which that system is designed will have long disappeared. The people and jobs will have gone, priced out of existence, while congestion and pollution will have made Dublin a dirty and unpleasant place in which to live unless the Government gets to grips with this. No matter what system we have, it will be irrelevant to today's population and economic conditions. We have a crisis and we need emergency intervention. That is why we launched a nine point emergency plan. We are not saying it will solve the problem but it may hold the chaos at bay a little longer and make life bearable.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxis, this is the Minister of State's night. Every year on this night the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, announces more taxis and I do not want to upstage him. He announced it last year and will do so again this year. We never actually get the taxis but this seems to be his special night for announcing it, so I will leave that to him. This is an industry in turmoil and every day taxi licences <Col N="558" /> are being withdrawn. I hope more thought has gone into this matter this year than last year.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister have 200 private bus licence applications on her desk that cannot be granted? What obscure and irrelevant legislation can possibly justify not granting these licences? There are 200 individuals and companies willing to provide a service to the people of Dublin, a service for which they are crying out, yet the Minister responsible for transport will not allow that service to be given by them or by CIE. Does that make any sense? Does the Minister have any sense of the fury that engenders in the citizens of Dublin? </P>
    <P>The biggest scandal of all is the fact that Dublin Bus, which will be the biggest service provider in Dublin for quite some years, will receive a paltry 275 additional buses over seven years out of the £40 billion in the national plan. That is an insult. What hope is there that the eight planned QBCs &ndash; if they ever materialise &ndash; will have sufficient buses?</P>
    <P>There is only one thing worse than no QBC and that is an inefficient QBC. The Minister has consistently misled and confused the public about the number of additional buses coming on-stream, and there is no adequate subsidy to run the 125 buses that have been ordered. The result is that the long haul commuter services to places like Kells and Arklow never got off the ground. Instead, cars from those areas are simply pouring into Dublin every day.</P>
    <P>Against such a background, one would have thought the Minister would have sought the extra capacity by allowing competition and making that a priority. Instead, she has taken the view that we have to wait until CIE is broken up into its component parts. The only type of competition we could ever have, before we let anybody else have a peep into the market, is that between Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. Even if that could be achieved in ten years, why is it desirable? Why must we have two giants as competition? Why can we not let in small, hungry, innovative companies which could provide real market competition? Can the reason possibly be to protect CIE? If that is the case, it is a misguided aspiration and even the CIE management would tell that to the Minister on the rare occasions she speaks to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had an unfortunate and even careless relationship with CIE. She has lost two chief executives and the chairman of the board, something which cannot be easy to achieve. We now have a position where, apparently, the chairman of the board communicates only with the chief executive in writing. The Minister does not speak to the chief executive.</P>

      <P>Is that a recipe for a happy, productive relationship and a good public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given nothing but confused messages to CIE. She has not given it any direction, leadership, policy guidelines or realistic subsidy to get on with the mammoth job with which <Col N="559" /> it is undoubtedly faced. It is no wonder the managers cannot manage and the workers will not work. They are either on strike or threatening strike. The only real wonder is that anything in that company works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not distinguished between the number of new cars and additional buses in Dublin, but I want to do so. Let there be no mistake. In the past year, the number of additional cars coming onto the streets of Dublin was 40,000. Last year the number was 30,000 new cars. That is 70,000 extra cars and the Minister's response has been to provide an additional 125 buses. Is she in touch with the problem at all? With almost unlimited resources we have had a very limited delivery. We have no buses, no late night DART, sometimes no DART at all, unsafe trains, no taxis, no QBCs, no Luas, no port tunnel and no proper policing of traffic on the multitude of road openings. In short, the Minister has given Dublin nothing but increasing misery.</P>
      <P>We needed a Minister who was bold, imaginative, determined and fearless and we got indifference, bluster, lethargy and ineptitude. Either she has not grasped the extent of the problem or she is overwhelmed by it. Either way, the Minister has failed and I join my colleagues in asking her to step aside and let somebody who can do the job do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion I want to mention three areas in the short time available to me. Last week I asked the Minister a question on the provision of the rail service to Navan. It is interesting to note that she informed me that under the DTO strategy, the planning and development of the railway line to order stage will not be finalised until 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>After the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it taking so long to produce the details of a line between Navan and Dublin that has been under consideration for the past three or four years, in conjunction with the local authority? The Minister also stated in the reply that it will be ten years before this line is built. I do not know if the Minister is aware &ndash; perhaps the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not informed her &ndash; that the people travelling from Navan to Dublin each morning have to allow two and a half hours to get into work. It is amazing that the Minister is telling us she will not have any proposals in place until after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is in relation to the park and ride facilities promised by the Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Taoiseach and numerous others prior to last <Col N="560" /> year's local elections. There are no park and ride facilities available. Why is that the case? I thought that park and ride facilities would be made available at the end of the motorway coming from Dunshaughlin but on the basis of what my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, has said, there is not a hope of that happening because buses are not being made available by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other point is in relation to the taxi deregulation proposal. Is there anything in that proposal to ease the pain that will be caused to taxi drivers who bought licences in the past two years? Some people have taxis licences for many years but there are others who never used them. Others are very concerned that there would be an easing of the position with regard to the making these additional licences available.</P>
    <P>We have a transport problem in this city. The DART is available to bring everybody into the city but it is not available to bring them home. That has been the case since this Minister came into office. We have no late night buses, to a large extent, and perhaps in her response the Minister might tell us if the two services which she told us today would be introduced in the very near future will operate continuously, not just at Christmas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose in the public enterprise portfolio, nobody has every borne such public chaos with such alacrity, if I can use that word. A number of weeks ago I had occasion to get the DART from Westland Row to Clontarf. As I stood on the platform, an announcement was made to the effect that the train would not be arriving because there was a shortage of staff. People continued to pile up the escalators from the ground floor and when there were at least 2,000 people on the platform, it was decided to close the doors on to the street where a further 2,000 people had gathered. The comments made about the DART service, the Minister and the Government are not repeatable here.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a lousy job and it will not be easy to sort out this problem. I notice that the spin on the difficulties across the water resulted in the Prime Minister calling in the director and the chief executives of these organisations on a regular basis to demand weekly programmes of action and a response.</P>
      <P>This year, several hundred people have been killed on our roads. In the past fortnight, almost a dozen young people have been killed. These are tragedies. If those people had been shot in the 1970s by the Provisional IRA, they would have become martyrs. They are forgotten now, but not by their families. All that remains are a few withered flowers on the roadside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the train because driving has become so aggressive in the past five years. That is all part of the stress and the rush to be where one is supposed to be at a certain time. I would support the investment of significant moneys in the mainline railways, as outlined by Deputy Jim Higgins, to achieve results. Dublin Airport, the DART service and the bus services are in absolute chaos. Passing Heuston Station on a Tuesday morning, one might see 200 people standing inside the gal<Col N="561" /> vanised railing in teeming rain, with no taxi in sight. These people may have come to Dublin for medical or business appointments, shopping or whatever. It is not good enough that in a city which has sent people all over the world the only tunnel we have is a tunnel of despair. The Minister and the Government presides over all of that. In one way the Irish people are a contradiction because despite the fact that nothing works in the public enterprise sector &ndash; the rail, bus, plane or taxi services &ndash; the Government is riding higher than ever in the polls. Perhaps it is a case of &ldquo;give them enough of it and they will return us to Government&rdquo;. The Minister stands indicted in the eyes of the nation because she presides as the political head over a series of absolute disasters that are the main talking point morning, noon and night of every man, woman and child who has to travel any distance in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be blamed for this situation but she has the resources of Government and massive facilities at her disposal to sort it out. Ireland's reputation as a business location is diminishing by the day. The situation is akin to what happened in Seoul, South Korea, where gridlock resulted in business people and investors taking their money, advice and opportunities to other countries where public transport was more accessible, amenable, comfortable, efficient, competent and professional.</P>

      <P>What did Fine Gael do about providing extra DART carriages? It allowed CIE to order ten such carriages without any Exchequer support. In the first year in office I approved the placing of an order for a further 16 carriages financed by the EU and the Exchequer. The motion criticises the failure to bring the new DART carriages into service but it is clear Fine Gael does not understand the complex commissioning process required to bring new rolling stock safely into operation.</P>
      <P>We have not rested on our laurels. An order for an extra 12 DART cars was placed earlier this year, with an option to buy a further 36. Twenty diesel railcars were also delivered earlier this year and will go into service on the upgraded Maynooth line early next year. A new order was also placed this year for an extra 60 diesel railcars to further augment the fleet.</P>

      <P>The Government acted quickly and decisively redefined and expanded the project. I set a clear timetable for its delivery and appointed an independent group to report publicly on progress. All the targets set have been achieved, work is well under way, 40 trams have been ordered and the first is due to be delivered next October. A competition to appoint a PPP operator will begin before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to announce that Dublin Bus will launch a substantially expanded Nitelink service at the end of this month. The service will operate throughout the Christmas period and permanently throughout the year on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. I recently met senior management in Dublin Bus to hear their plans and I express my appreciation for their work in enhancing the Nitelink service. Dublin Bus proposes to commence this enhanced Nitelink service on Thursday, 30 November, and it will operate nightly up to and including Saturday, 6 January 2001 except on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>The enhanced service has a number of elements. In addition to the existing 17 routes, four new routes will be introduced to Ashbourne, Dunboyne, Kilnamanagh and Cornelscourt. This will bring the total number of routes to 20. Existing services will be extended into suburban housing estates. For example, it is proposed to operate services into residential areas in Tallaght and Clondalkin. Some existing services will travel further. A number of suburban pick-up points along the routes of Nitelink buses will be introduced and the service will operate on a continuous basis, approximately every 20 minutes from 12.30 a.m. to 4.30 a.m. These proposals from Dublin Bus will significantly enhance the capacity of the Nitelink service, enabling it to carry approximately 10,000 passengers each night.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion calls for action on integrated ticketing. However, Fine Gael was not among those who called for the development of integrated ticketing for Dublin. Today I published the report of the working group which I established to look at this issue. In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Richard Bruton last week, I outlined that I would bring this matter to Cabinet this week, so I am not pulling rabbits out of a hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion also refers to bus competition but what did Fine Gael ever do to promote such competition? The answer again is &ndash; nothing. It was the policy of the Fine Gael led Government not to grant licences to private operators in Dublin. We changed that policy in July 1999 and, since then, 17 licences have been awarded. My Department is finalising proposals for revised, more liberal guidelines for bus licensing in the greater Dublin area and is proposing an early licensing round under these revised guidelines. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, <Col N="565" /> and I will urgently consider these proposals and make an announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>This Government has also published far-reaching proposals for reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area and for wide-ranging institutional reform of public transport which I set out in a consultative document. Many organisations and individuals have responded to the consultation and most of the responses have broadly supported our proposals. The Public Transport Partnership Forum, representing the partnership pillars, has decided to commission independent research before formally responding to the consultation.</P>
    <P>Next month the Cabinet infrastructure committee will consider proposals for the institutional arrangements for transport and land use in Dublin. In 2001 my Department will complete a review of bus market regulation outside Dublin. These will be the final pieces in a comprehensive package of policy development and reform.</P>
    <P>This Government has given more attention to institutional and regulatory reform of public transport than any Government over the past 50 years. The only period of comparable policy development was in the 1940s around the time of the setting up of CIE. In addition, for the first time we have put in place a coherent investment strategy in the national plan, supported by Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>We are also planning for the longer term. The Taoiseach recently launched the DTO's far-sighted transportation strategy for 2000 to 2016 which sets out a short, medium and long-term programme with a major focus on public transport development and demand management. The DTO is now working on the further development of this strategy and will soon publish an implementation plan and a new short-term action plan for the period 2001 to 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition, preliminary work on the metro network, approved by Government in July, is well under way. The light rail project office is completing a preliminary technical scoping report and consultants engaged by the Department in August will shortly provide a preliminary report on the most appropriate approach to a PPP for this project. The DTO strategy identified a number of rail projects that could be developed as public private partnerships. I propose to establish an independent State body with responsibility for procuring rail infrastructure through PPPs. The necessary legislation will be introduced in the new year.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal in detail with the mini CTC signalling project but I intend to attend the public enterprise committee and I hope that many of those before me will go into that project in the greatest of detail. Before I move on, I want to clarify several points in the Fine Gael motion. The mini CTC project is not part of the railway safety programme approved by the Government, it is part of an earlier EU assisted railway renewal programme planned by the then Minister, Deputy Lowry, which pre-dated the safety initiative. I should also point out that the mini CTC project has not received Exchequer funding nor is it intended that it should.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> Another untruth from Deputy Higgins relates to the industrial relations difficulties in Aer Lingus. I heard on the radio this evening &ndash; we checked with Aer Lingus &ndash; that the clerical workers have agreed, 60:40, to the terms laid down by the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. I do not deal with the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court in terms of going to those places and working through labour relations difficulties. The detail of those is for the Government machinery. I am glad the expertise of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court has been successful in resolving the clerical workers arrangements in Aer Lingus. I welcome that. I know there are many more difficult days ahead for the people who will be at the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The company has acknowledged that there is an issue of low pay and it is addressing this in the proposals being put forward to resolve the disputes. As I said, I welcome very much the positive outcome announced this afternoon of the ballot of the clerical staff on the new pay deal worked out by management and union representatives under the auspices of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There was extreme congestion at certain times in Dublin Airport over the summer months. I met the chief executive and the chairman of Aer Rianta to discuss this issue. I am satisfied that the measures which both I and Aer Rianta have taken will alleviate congestion at Dublin Airport. Aer Rianta is investing over £350 million in its major expansion programme at the airport which will provide greater comfort for the ever increasing number of passengers.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers opposite talked about the objection Aer Rianta lodged to the McEvaddy &ndash; they did not mention McEvaddy &ndash; proposal for a terminal in May 1997. Let me be quite clear, the then Minister, Deputy Dukes, also objected to Fingal County Council about that planning application. That was not mentioned of course, but that is a fact.</P>
    <P>The expansion plan includes a new arrivals area and baggage hall, new check-in desks, equipment and technology and new exits and entrances. In September I designated Dublin Airport as a co-ordinated airport and my Department has appointed Airport Co-ordination Limited to take over the function of co-ordinating landing and take off slots which heretofore were handled on a voluntary basis by Aer Lingus and not by Aer Rianta. My decision to designate Dublin Airport as a co-ordinated airport, coupled with the expansion programme and ongoing improvements, will contribute to a significant easing of the pressures on facilities at the airport and will result in a much greater degree of comfort for passengers.</P>
    <P>I am sharing my time with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the amendment to the motion. Transport management in Dublin <Col N="567" /> in all its aspects is rightly a matter of urgent public and political concern.</P>
      <P>My Department is sponsor of the Dublin Transportation Office which is mandated to drive and co-ordinate the implementation of the Dublin Transport Initiative. By the end of 2000, more than £500 million will have been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure projects within the DTI framework. Under the DTO Platform for Change, which has just been published, over £16 billion is to be committed to improving Dublin transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The DTI final report recognised that taxis form an important part of the overall transport system in Dublin. They are designed to provide the most flexible form of public transport, offering a door to door service at all times of the day. Taxis come within my delegated responsibilities as Minister of State, and I wish to pay particular attention to this element of tonight's motion.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government parties' revised An Action Programme for the Millennium has made an explicit commitment to improving the Dublin taxi service in the following terms: &ldquo;We will introduce measures to increase progressively the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible in order to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The background to this initiative was the failure of the previous Government to make any impact on the chronic taxi deficit in Dublin. The sum total of new taxi licences issued in Dublin under the last Government was zero. Between 1997 and 1999, under this Government, 750 new wheelchair accessible taxi licences were granted by Dublin Corporation. While this limited increase in taxi supply was welcome, the present Government determined in late 1999 that a much greater supply of taxis was needed in Dublin to meet public demand.</P>
      <P>That is why we developed our radical initiative for the issue of 3,100 new Dublin taxi licences. This initiative was followed up by new regulations which I made in January of this year. As the House will know, these regulations have been struck down by the High Court in a judgment which was finalised on 14 November. In that judgment, the High Court made it clear that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders cannot be contemplated. The outcome of the court case calls for a modified policy approach to the issues involved but the direction and resolve of the Government's proposed reforms has not been altered.</P>
      <P>In light of the High Court judgment, and in consultation with my Government colleagues, I have determined that it would not be reasonable or desirable to maintain quantitative controls on taxi licences, such as have operated for over 20 years. Accordingly, the new regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which will be granted by local licensing authorities. These changes will apply not just to Dublin, but also to the taxi services operating in all other taximeter areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations provide, in accordance with <Col N="568" /> EU requirements, for more frequent and systematic testing of taxis and other public service vehicles. This function is to be discharged in future annually instead of biannually by the National Car Testing Service Limited and for a transitional period, vehicle testing by Garda public service vehicle inspectors, including the Dublin Carriage Office, will also continue in parallel with NCTS testing.</P>
    <P>Taxis must also by 1 January 2002 be fitted with taximeters which are capable of printing automatic receipts. The new regulations also validate the operation of taxi sharing from taxi stands designated by local authorities for this purpose.</P>
    <P>All of these new provisions, together with the continuation of existing requirements for public service vehicle driver licensing and insurance, are designed to ensure an improved quality of service to customers in the new situation.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a rapid improvement of taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, I intend to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a continuing need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxi. It is also desirable to ensure that new applications for taxi licences are bona fide for the purpose of providing public service. With these considerations in mind, the regulations fix the fee for the grant of a new taxi licence at £5,000 and for a new wheelchair accessible taxi licence at £100.</P>
    <P>It has not been practicable to maintain a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, I now put on record my intention that, from the end of 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible. Taxi service providers should now gear themselves to this requirement.</P>
    <P>I would like to call on taxi services providers to respond positively to the challenges and opportunities of the new business environment which the regulations will establish. I acknowledge that the adjustments which have now been necessitated will be difficult for many existing taxi operators. However, I am confident that with appropriate organisation and monitoring, these operators and others can achieve good returns given the current urgent and buoyant demand for enhanced taxi services.</P>
    <P>Given the many changes which are now taking place, certain recent new holders or wheelchair accessible taxi licences will be in the position of having paid much higher licence fees to local authorities than those which will now obtain. I intend to consult local authorities and taxi representative bodies with a view to developing an administrative scheme to address this situation. In addition, I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Finance will consider a provision to allow tax relief over a number of years for any actual capital loss incurred by existing taxi licence holders <Col N="569" /> by reference to the actual sum paid for the licence. The details will be contained in the Finance Bill, 2001.</P>
    <P>In my statement to the House this time last year, I said that as the capital of a rapidly expanding economy, Dublin has experienced increasing demand for mobility in all travel modes. Numbers passing through Dublin Airport have more than doubled since 1993 and reached almost 13 million in 1999. There are now in the region of 122 hotels in Dublin, compared to only 88 in 1995, and tourism has become a major industry in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The current inadequate supply of taxis in Dublin risks harming the capital's reputation in the eyes of international business people and other visitors. It also remains a source of frustration to residents of the city. A continuation of this situation is not supportable. I am confident that this important Government initiative will benefit the public and the Dublin taxi industry alike. The Dublin taxi market, like many other sectors of Dublin's economy, is capable of significant and sustained growth. As such, it can well support a larger, service-driven industry to the mutual benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted decisively to ensure a high quality taxi service for customers in Dublin and in the other urban taximeter areas. I hope our actions will have the support of all Members of the House. In relation to other Dublin transport measures being sponsored by my Department, the quality bus corridor programme is proceeding actively. Four have been opened to date &ndash; Lucan, Malahide Road, Stillorgan and Finglas. The construction of a further four &ndash; north Clondalkin, Tallaght, Rathfarnham and Blanchardstown &ndash; will be completed by March 2001. Swords QBC will be completed by May 2001, with a service to the airport expected to be operational earlier in the year. Ballymun will be ready by August 2001, with south Clondalkin and the orbital route to be completed as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the QBC programme as quickly as one might have desired. This is due to factors such as opposition to QBCs by some traders, difficult issues connected with residential parking, protracted public consultations, the availability of contractors and the difficulties of working in a live traffic environment. Notwithstanding these problems, the QBC programme has been an outstanding success to date and will be expanded and developed under the NDP and the recently completed strategy update by the Dublin Transportation Office. In this connection, consideration will be given to the implementation arrangements which are most likely to ensure effective delivery of the programme in the future.</P>
    <P>The DTO update strategy also proposes that park and ride facilities will integrate the car with public transport and that there will be park and ride facilities for commuters at strategic locations where the national road network meets the public transport networks. However, it will be essential to assess all proposed park and ride sites to <Col N="570" /> ensure that cars accessing them do not add to congestion.</P>
    <P>Under the Finance Act, 1999, tax incentives were made available in respect of expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of park and ride facilities associated with residential development. Related guidelines were issued by my Department to local authorities in August 1999. While there has been limited response to the incentives to date, it is hoped that the Dublin Transportation Office will be able to stimulate interest by the private sector in this initiative. European Union approval is awaited before guidelines on commercial park and ride facilities can be issued. An application in this regard has been sent to the EU by the Department of Finance. By the end of the year, 2000 car park and ride spaces will have been provided.</P>
    <P>These measures are in addition to the major national roads programme being promoted in the greater Dublin area. The southern cross route is nearing completion, while work on the airport motorway is well under way. Construction will now begin on the Dublin port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway and the new Westlink bridge. Plans for a further upgrading of the M50 and for an eastern motorway are also being advanced.</P>
    <P>The scale and pace of measures to improve Dublin's transport infrastructure and services is striking. The major potential for service improvements in Dublin taxis which I announced this evening support and assist this process. The challenges of providing good transport services in Dublin are real and demanding. The Government is ensuring that these challenges will be fully met and that sustainable and effective transport arrangements will be put in place across the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement. It is a balanced package which does not include overly-qualitative restrictions that effectively become quantitative restrictions. By not introducing quantitative restrictions, the Minister of State is in keeping with the decision of the High Court. His measures are in line with that decision.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that the Minister will consider a capital allowance for taxi operators who may have lost out in terms of the cost of licences. Some operators paid up to £80,000 for a taxi plate and they will be compensated through a capital allowance. This is the proper balance in the equation. As a result of a court decision, the Government is effectively being pushed down the road of deregulation where there can be only qualitative restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has kept those restrictions to a minimum and he has balanced that against the justifiable concerns of people who suffered losses because they, in good faith, invested in taxi plates. They subsequently discovered that the State kept changing its mind, arbitrarily in some cases over the past few years, and the market value of the licence decreased. All Deputies have heard stories in their constituencies about people who mortgaged themselves to the hilt to <Col N="571" /> acquire a taxi licence. If they continue to operate those licences, the provisions that, I hope, will be announced by the Minister for Finance will allow them to draw down a capital allowance for the actual loss involved. This is critical because some people in the taxi community are slightly paranoid about deregulation. However, deregulation on that basis is good.</P>
    <P>A corresponding strong measure announced by the Minister of State addresses the quality issue and the upgrading of the industry. Dublin is reliant on overseas visitors and it is important that the standard of taxis is improved. The Minister of State indicated that, from 2003, there will be a requirement that all taxis operating in the market, particularly in Dublin, are wheelchair accessible. This is a bonus and a good development. All Members who have travelled know the high standard of vehicles abroad. The Minister of State also announced that more regular checks of vehicles will be carried out to ensure safety requirements are being met. All Members would agree with this move.</P>
    <P>A conclusion to the endless wars and arbitrary decisions is finally in sight. Taxi and hackney drivers have been treated arbitrarily by Governments. The goalposts were constantly moved and, not surprisingly, they felt most aggrieved as a result. The Minister of State's announcement will give the taxi and hackney sectors an opportunity to develop appropriately. People will have the ability to progress &ndash; for example, a cosy operator will have the opportunity to become a licence holder if he or she wishes to operate a taxi plate and hackney drivers will also have the opportunity to take taxi plates.</P>
    <P>The concerns of existing players who may have paid over the odds for their taxi licences will also be addressed. However, I am glad the decision does not involve compensation. It has been properly worded in terms of what the Minister for Finance will do &ndash; it is a capital allowance. I am sure the Attorney General will agree to the measure because it is not compensation. It is a realisation that, through a mismatch of regulations, court decisions and, in some cases, improper decisions, the State mitigated against individuals who were trying to operate a decent business.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party, particularly Deputy Jim Higgins, for moving this motion, which my party supports at this time. I am disappointed that the Minister responsible for the area under discussion has again shown her contempt for the House by leaving the Chamber. She did not even leave behind a Minister of State from her Department to take the debate. Having said that, I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, who is present. It is nothing new for the Minister to show her contempt for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In everything other than the words used, this is a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. In a <Col N="572" /> Government where mediocrity is the norm and inability to take a decision almost a requirement for office, Deputy O'Rourke has stood out for all the wrong reasons. Rarely has a Minister been found so wanting in meeting the challenge of her portfolio; rarely has a Minister had such vast financial resources at her disposal, yet made so little impact; and rarely has a Minister promised so much and delivered so little in an area so crucial to the quality of life of so many of our citizens. Deputy O'Rourke is an experienced politician who should know that photo opportunities are no substitute for taking decisions and that making funny faces on the Order of Business is no substitute for a coherent public transport policy.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing a public transport crisis, the social and economic costs of which are enormous. People have died because they found themselves in dangerous situations as a result of the inadequacy of late night public transport. Hundreds of thousands of people are spending more and more of their time in what should be the simple task of travelling to and from work. It is not unusual even for those who live only a few miles from their place of work to spend an hour travelling there and back. At a rate of two hours a day, or ten hours a week, more than a full working day per week is taken travelling to and from work in the Ireland of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Tens of thousands of people in Dublin and the surrounding areas take their lives in their hands every day by cramming into dangerously overcrowded and inadequate DART and suburban rail carriages. One simply dreads to think what the consequences would be if one of these trains was involved in an accident. The economic cost to business and industry through lost production as a result of people being late for work because of inadequate public transport, or long delays in making deliveries because of traffic gridlock, can only be estimated.</P>
    <P>The core problem is the chronic under-funding of public transport and the failure to take and adhere to decisions regarding the development of public transport. All Administrations in recent decades must take a share of the responsibility for the under-funding of public transport, but the primary responsibility for the current situation must rest with this Government and this Minister. Other Governments, in difficult economic times, had to scrape around to try and find £1 million here and another £1 million there. This Government, on the other hand, has virtually unlimited financial resources at its disposal, yet people see the public transport system disimproving and disintegrating before their eyes.</P>
    <P>There is a simple rule of thumb when it comes to public transport: what one is prepared to invest determines the quality of what one receives in return. The generally poor level of public transport in this country reflects the fact that it is chronically under-funded.</P>
    <P>There is a popular myth that public transport in Ireland receives a huge level of Government subsidy compared to other countries. In fact, the opposite is the case, especially in regard to Dublin Bus. Most of the Government subvention goes to maintaining the rail network. A submission <Col N="573" /> made by the department of economics in UCD to the Minister's Department in April of his year, comparing subvention levels for public transport systems in European cities, found that in the case of Dublin Bus 96.4% of its operating costs came from fares, with just 3.6% from Government subsidy. This is virtually the lowest level of subsidy for any of the 60 European cities surveyed, where levels of subsidy of up to 60% are not unusual. For example, in Vienna 69.9% of operating costs come from subsidies or grants, the main Belgian cities enjoy an average subsidy of 67.4% and in the four Italian cities surveyed, the average level is 60.2%.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been lucky enough to use public transport in the cities to which I refer will testify that this level of subsidy guarantees prompt, efficient, comfortable and reliable services. The systems on offer in these cities represent everything that our public transport system is not. While there may have been some marginal improvement in the situation since the study was prepared, the basic position remains the same.</P>
    <P>Subsidy alone will not provide acceptable levels of public transport. It is obvious that acceptable levels of public transport cannot be provided with the level of Exchequer support currently provided in this country. Unfortunately, rather than facing the need for proper levels of subsidy, this Minister has actually gone the road of increasing fares, of asking people to pay more to use an unsatisfactory and inefficient system. At the end of last year, with the Dublin South Central by-election safely out of the way, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, announced an increase of 10% in Dublin Bus fares. At a time when Dublin is slowly grinding to a halt because of its chronic traffic problems and when the absolute priority should be to encourage the greater use of public transport, even a Minister as out of touch as Deputy O'Rourke should have recognised that it was an act of lunacy to increase bus fares.</P>
    <P>The success of the Stillorgan quality bus corridor, which has resulted in a huge increase in the numbers using buses, indicates that people are prepared to leave their cars behind if there is an economical and efficient public transport system. However, the bus service in much of the city is still inadequate and &ndash; largely because of traffic problems &ndash; inefficient and unreliable. Increasing fares in these circumstances simply has the effect of encouraging people to return to using their cars which, in turn, will cause the traffic problem to worsen and slow down the buses even more. This vicious circle must be broken. A significant increase in the Government subvention for public transport is essential.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish not to recognise that seriously inadequate management and outmoded industrial relations procedures in CIE have contributed to the problems in all three companies. There has been a welcome acknowledgment by management that the old system whereby workers on a low basic wage had to put in long hours of overtime to earn a reasonable income is no longer desirable or acceptable. Poor pay, long hours and poor conditions lead to low morale <Col N="574" /> which, in turn, leads to poor services to the public.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions since taking office, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has managed to make difficult situations within CIE even worse. She has managed to alienate both management and unions in CIE and in a number of the other semi-State companies for which she has responsibility. For the Minister to succeed in this area, she must be able to develop a constructive relationship with both senior management and workers. The Minister has shown the ability to do neither. It is no coincidence that during her period in office, she lost two chairpersons of Telecom and that the chairperson of CIE also decided he had enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to industrial disputes has been unpredictable and inconsistent. On some occasions she has refused to interest herself at all &ndash; as in the case of the Dublin Bus strike earlier in the year &ndash; while on other occasions she has gone in with fists and boots flying.</P>
    <P>That some progress has been made has been due to the efforts of both management and unions, rather than the Minister's ham-fisted approach. The problems that led to the Dublin Bus strike seem to have been largely resolved. It is to be hoped that the agreement reached at the negotiations on Sunday will be approved by DART drivers which will also remove that matter from the agenda. However, the dispute involving signalling staff threatens to bring the national rail system to a halt again this week and there are other disputes simmering just below the surface. An efficient, modern, well funded public transport system, which would be in the interests of both workers and commuters, cannot operate on the basis of a 19th century labour relations model.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most damning characteristic of the Minister's term of office has been her dithering and inability to take decisions. When the Rainbow Government left office in the summer of 1997, plans for the Luas system were well advanced. If they had been allowed to proceed, at least part of the Luas system would now be up and running. Luas would not have provided a complete answer to Dublin's transport problems but if it had been allowed to proceed on schedule, it would now be providing a significant degree of relief.</P>
    <P>The first thing Deputy O'Rourke did on entering office was to surrender to pressure from the Progressive Democrats by putting everything on hold until the possibility of running part of the Luas system underground was examined. This took a year and has been followed by a succession of reviews, redrafts, relaunches, new plans and, most of all, endless photo opportunities by the Minister. Three and a half years after taking office, the legacy of the Minister is a public transport system that is slower, less efficient and more expensive. We have not had a single extra DART carriage, while the promised DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide are not yet fully operational. Not a single metre of line is in place for Luas and the small number of additional buses that have been provided has not been able to do <Col N="575" /> anything more than put a small dent in the problem.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of October, the Taoiseach was drafted in to launch yet another new plan. On paper the plan for improved suburban surface rail, an underground interconnector, Luas and metro on the surface and underground looks impressive until one reads the small print and discovers that some of these will not be available for at least 15 or 16 years. I am not sure what comfort commuters who have to queue for half an hour this evening for a bus that might or might not come or who are crammed into rail carriages like cattle will get from knowing that, all going well, this problem might be sorted out in 15 or 16 years.</P>
    <P>What the public is demanding, and what it is entitled to, is a clear indication of what is planned and intended for Dublin. What it is getting is short-sighted, short-term attempts by Government Ministers to claim credit for initiatives. For example, my understanding is that the Dublin Transport Office has already communicated its long-term co-ordinated vision for the future of Dublin transport to the Government. Why has it not yet been adopted? Instead, the Government has sought to cherry pick what it regards as the juiciest elements of the strategy to claim glory for itself, with Ministers competing with one another in so doing.</P>
    <P>This has been the way the Government has dealt with this issue since coming into office. The competing vested interests of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil effectively forced us back to the drawing board. I give a commitment tonight on behalf of the Labour Party that should we be returned to Government we will not go down that route. We have the plans and the only issue now is implementation. I call on the Government to adopt the DTO plan in full. I also call on it to set out a clear strategy for its full implementation. Its publication should be followed up with an extensive advertising campaign to inform the people of Dublin of the plans that are in place. This should be accompanied by circulation of the relevant material door to door.</P>
    <P>The people living in the DTO regime should be asked to endorse the strategy in a plebiscite. We should have an assertion of what the public perceives to be in its best interests. Those who wish to object or complain should have the onus of explaining why their position should override the clearly expressed view of the public. It is time to shift the balance away from &ldquo;not doing&rdquo; to &ldquo;doing&rdquo;. This has been done in other European cities and it is something we should do. In the meantime we should forget about high profile launches of plans for metros and light rail. Let us be honest with the public in a manner that the Government is so singularly incapable of being.</P>
    <P>The future for Dublin transport over the next five years is buses and bus lanes as nothing else will be possible within that timeframe. We need more quality buses and lanes for them to run on. We need to expedite the introduction of competition for routes to improve efficiency and to add to the capacity of the carriage system. I will sup<Col N="576" /> port the introduction of such competition. We must expedite the introduction of quality bus corridors and clear the planning bottlenecks which are holding them up. Let us not get bogged down on the issue of ownership of CIE. Despite the loss of public confidence in CIE, privatisation is a side issue, a distraction. Competition should go some way to resolving the issues which arise here. If the Minister put as much energy into this issue as she put into public relations exercises we could have made considerable progress in recent years.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is clear is that if public transport is to be a serious option for Dublin it will require considerable investment and a clear indication from the Government, particularly in terms of a pricing mechanism, that it intends to prioritise public over private transport. Public transport is, in part, what my party's policy statement &ldquo;New Direction, New Priorities&rdquo; is about. Subvention to pay for public transport is what that policy is about. Integrated ticketing on foot of competition is an absolute must. We cannot allow cherry-picking of routes by private operators either. I make no bones about it, we will get competition only if we are prepared to subsidise service delivery.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to taxis. I spoke about the need for honesty and coming clean with the public. The relationship between Fianna Fáil and elements in the taxi industry, particularly in Dublin, has been one of the most sordid in recent years. The extent of support for Fianna Fáil through advertising on taxis during the last election is a case for banning corporate or business donations to politicians. Never has a financial link between donation and delivery been so clear. However, for Fianna Fáil the link with taxi drivers is no longer expedient. If one puts aside the bleatings of Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern, which usually come to nothing, we can see that taxi drivers are being set aside by Fianna Fáil, which is hardly able to face them given its hypocrisy on the issue.</P>
    <P>I am not a supporter of deregulation elsewhere in the economy so I will not support it in this case either. Standards in the taxi industry should be regulated. The cars that operate it and the fares that apply should also be regulated as it is in the public interest. However, I am opposed to the regulation of numbers within the industry. Market demands must be met and the availability of more plates will serve to increase demand. On a first reading, the Minister's proposals seem to meet the criteria outlined by me and I welcome that. However, there are losers in the process. Many taxi drivers have invested huge sums in gaining access to this industry and they will regard themselves as the losers this evening. I make no bones about it, responsibility for their fate lies in the hands of Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The mini-CTC affair is a scandal of enormous proportions. It involves an open-ended contract for the laying of cables and the installation of a new signalling system to improve safety for rail travellers. It involves a contract where the terms allowed the price to grow from £16 million to £40 million. It involves a private operator, Mr. O'Brien of Esat, being allowed to gazump CIE <Col N="577" /> on its own track in its own territory, thereby costing CIE millions of pounds in additional costs and giving Mr. O'Brien and Esat access to the rail network for its fibre optic cable. I am sure he is laughing all the way to the bank.</P>
    <P>It involves the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who either knew the details at an early stage of the scandal and kept it to herself or who was so incompetent that she was not aware of a £25 million overspend on a contract within her remit. She certainly knew about the scandal a year ago and did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>When the Opposition prised the information about the scandal out of her she immediately tried to get rid of the hot potato by asking the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise to investigate it. Why did she not do so when she first became aware of the scandal? In any other country in Europe a Minister who had treated her obligations in such a blasé fashion would have been forced to resign.</P>
    <P>On the basis of all the evidence over the past three and a half years, I regret I have to conclude that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is no longer capable of doing the demanding job her remit requires. Perhaps she is tired or suffering from burnout similar to the Tánaiste. In any event she is not doing her job, but that does not prevent her displaying quite amazing arrogance as was evidenced recently at the conclusion of Second Stage of the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000. A total of 51 Members contributed to the debate, yet the Minister decided not to come into the House to reply. Instead she gave a five minute script to the Minister of State, which ignored all the contributions that had been made. It was an insult to the House. We got another taste of that arrogance this evening when she again did not remain in the House to listen to a debate under her remit.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this urgent and important matter. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, for coming to the House to reply, but given the gravity of the situation in Waterford I am disappointed the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is not present &ndash; I saw her in the House a short time ago.</P>

    <P>This evening 119 people employed by Tech Industries in Waterford face a bleak winter. Last Friday out of the blue the company announced it would close its factory on 31 December next and that every job would be lost. The timing could not be less opportune as families prepare for Christmas. The news was greeted with shock and alarm, not just among the workforce and union <Col N="578" /> officials but also within the wider community in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Tech Industries has been in Waterford for 22 years. The company makes bottle caps for the cosmetics industry and it claims that its current trading problems are the result of rising inflation, exchange rate problems and a significant increase in the cost of the main raw material for this industry, oil. While new employment opportunities have been created in Waterford in recent years it still has a stubbornly high rate of unemployment. Unemployment rates in some areas of the city and county are nothing short of scandalous. Unemployment is still a major problem in the constituency and the potential loss of 119 jobs is a devastating blow.</P>
    <P>Workers at Tech Industries have mortgages and bills to meet. Their lives have been thrown into turmoil by last Friday's announcement. Despite talk of full employment which is increasingly becoming an accepted truism trotted out by economic commentators and others, the reality in my constituency is that if these jobs are lost the workers will face an uphill struggle to find new jobs with decent pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>I urge the Tánaiste to take immediate steps to fight to ensure that as many jobs as possible are retained at the plant. Local trade union officials are confident that a large number of these jobs can be saved and that the plant can remain viable and continue to provide employment in Waterford. With this goal in mind SIPTU, the union representing the majority of the workers in the plant, is eager to enter into immediate negotiations with the company. A meeting took place this afternoon and I ask the Tánaiste to fully support the efforts of the unions at the plant. A high level of intervention by both the Minister and the IDA may well be crucial in reversing the company's decision to pull out of Waterford completely.</P>
    <P>In addition to the immediate question of saving the jobs at Tech Industries, I support trade union calls for the Minister to establish an employment task force for the Waterford region. There has been a constant haemorrhage of jobs from Waterford over recent years and the record of inward investment there has not matched that in other counties and regions. Waterford is an excellent location for employment and significant investment can be attracted to the constituency if an overall plan involving all State agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the Waterford Institute of Technology is drawn up and everyone works to a common agenda.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister of State will be able to give positive news to the workers at Tech Industries and the Waterford community. All of them are deeply concerned at the poverty and disadvantage which unemployment still causes in the constituency.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, had a prior commitment and, consequently, could not be present. She was in the House for the previous debate because she had a personal interest in it and was <Col N="579" /> available. I am honoured to take this debate on her behalf and I assure the Deputy that the Government takes collective responsibility seriously.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I regret the announcement by Tech Industries of its intention to cease production in Waterford, where it has provided valuable employment to many people since 1987. The company employs 117 people in the manufacture of injection and compression moulded bottle caps which are mainly used in the cosmetic industry.</P>
      <P>Tech Industries informed IDA Ireland on 20 November 2000 of its intention to cease production in Waterford on 31 December 2000. The company stated that there has been a severe decline in markets caused by exchange rate, inflationary and other pressures. These included a significant increase in the cost of its core raw material, a by-product of oil. The company operates on high volumes and low margins and could not continue passing on price increases to its customers.</P>
      <P>Tech Industries made significant investment in the plant in recent years and despite efforts by management and employees, the company is unfortunately no longer capable of sustaining ongoing losses. IDA Ireland has spoken with the president of the company who outlined these reasons for the announcement of the closure. The IDA is liaising with US management on avenues which could be explored to preserve certain elements of the project which are viable in Waterford. These discussions are at an early stage.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland continues to actively promote Waterford city and county as a suitable location for inward investment projects. In 1999 both Allied Signal and AOL Bertlesmann announced expansions which between them will create 500 jobs. This is an endorsement of the success of the companies' existing facilities in Waterford. In 2000, Microbrush in Dungarvan was approved to create 35 new jobs in the dental hygiene field.</P>
      <P>Other positive developments include a new 25,000 square foot advance building to be constructed in the Waterford Industrial Park and the development of a prestigious 70 acre technology park on the Cork Road near the Waterford Institute of Technology. Site development is almost completed. Planning permission has been obtained for 200,000 square foot of office buildings, to be constructed by the private sector. In Belview, IDA Ireland has assembled 176 acres which is being promoted as a strategic site for large process industry. The IDA is continuing to work with the Belview forum towards the provision of services including gas, electricity, water etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working with indigenous industry in the Waterford region to assist it to develop sustainable competitive advantage. The agency aims to build on the success achieved in the area in 1999 when a net gain of 107 jobs was achieved by companies in its client base. In a separate development in February last NTL announced the establishment of a high-tech <Col N="580" /> customer management centre which will create 250 jobs.</P>
    <P>FÁS employment services officers are to meet the staff at Tech Industries. They will hold individual guidance and counselling interviews. Following this process FÁS will provide guidance in relation to jobs and appropriate training courses. I am confident that the strenuous efforts being made by the development agencies will yield positive results on the industrial front for Waterford and it is not proposed to establish a task force at this time. However, I assure the Deputy and other Members from Waterford that the Tánaiste, myself, our colleagues in Government, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the State agencies, including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county and city enterprise boards in Waterford, will do our utmost to ensure that this difficulty is overcome as quickly as possible and further investment is made in this important area.</P>

      <P>The recent Phillips report in the UK on BSE has served to highlight the cost of secrecy and paternalism. That report was 16 volumes long, took two and a half years to complete and cost £27 million. In the UK more than 80 people have died so far from new variant CJD. Millions of cattle have been slaughtered and it has cost the beef industry in the order of £4 billion. Above all else, the Phillips report emphasises the cost of secrecy, the inability to communicate and the paternalistic approach of Ministers, civil servants and scientists alike as far as the public is concerned. It is against that background that it is crucial the public is kept informed of the status of BSE and new variant CJD, the measures agreed to deal with BSE, how these are implemented and who will take responsibility for that implementation.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated assurances that Ireland has a very effective plan for dealing with BSE, the numbers of reported cases continue to increase annually and, this year, the numbers were the highest to date. The continued use of meat and bonemeal after the ban was imposed in 1990 plus the long incubation period for BSE are two factors which are considered to have contributed to that continuing increase. It is important that the full testing of livestock intended for slaughter should now be introduced without delay in Ireland. The health of the population as well as the security of the export meat trade will be targets for speculation and uncertainty unless a comprehensive and reliable testing programme is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the disposal of carcases must be addressed. Within the guidelines proposed by the EU, it will be impossible to cope with the disposal of carcases if the current system continues. The recent reports of carcases being buried close to a water supply is an indication of the inadequacy of the current system. While that has now changed and interim measures are in place to hold suspect or infected carcases in cold storage, that cannot be allowed continue indefinitely. Leaving aside <Col N="581" /> the need for a facility to store carcases, the Minister needs to provide a safe means of final disposal. If we are to have confidence in the system which deals with the disposal of BSE infected carcases, the issue of incineration must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>The origins of BSE are traceable to contaminated animal feed which worked its way in ever increasing circles into the food chain. The practice of feeding bovine protein to cows sparked a chain letter type effect of BSE in cattle and variant CJD in humans in the UK. In the UK also, misleading assurances and incorrect extrapolations led to what can be described as mismanagement, misuse, misinterpretation and miscommunication of science. There are too many unknowns in BSE and a commitment must be made to substantial research investment so that developments can be monitored and understood as they pertain to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Union has set out recommendations for animal feed. In Ireland, mammalian meat and bonemeal may not be fed to cattle, sheep, goats or deer. However, it can still be manufactured under licence and may be kept on land or premises where there are ruminants provided the storage is licensed. Statements such as &ldquo;persons who store or transport mammalian meat and bone meal shall take all necessary precautions to ensure that it does not contaminate any other product&rdquo; do not inspire confidence. Knowing the history of meat and bonemeal in the BSE disaster, it is naive or worse to allow any mammalian meat and bonemeal into the food chain. Its manufacture should be stopped now. We also know at this stage that BSE crosses the species barrier and that is a further reason to reconsider the use of any mammalian meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>The role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in monitoring and ensuring food safety should be reviewed. It is not appropriate that the Department with responsibility for the marketing and promotion of live animals and meat should, at the same time, have responsibility for ensuring safety within the human food chain. The possibility that one infected cow could infect 400,000 people is stark. For this reason, it is urgent that testing of all animals intended for slaughter be introduced. BSE, as well as crossing the species barrier, has crossed national boundaries and the health and trade consequences are now being experienced. National discussions are no longer adequate to deal with this problem and, while I welcome the co-ordination and enforcement recommended by Commissioner Byrne, it needs to go further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>After a protracted debate on the issue on 20 and 21 November, the Minister and his colleagues in the Council of Ministers agreed a series of conclusions regarding recent developments on BSE. The Council's intention was to provide the necessary levels of consumer protection and to re-establish a Community approach on this sensitive issue in the light of unilateral measures <Col N="582" /> recently taken by a number of member states. As the Deputy will be aware, consumer confidence had been dented by recent events in France, in particular, where there has been an increase in cases this year.</P>
      <P>The Council also welcomed the Commission's proposal to extend rapid screening tests for bovines at risk from the beginning of next year and, in the light of the results of that programme, to extend it to categories of bovines aged over 30 months. In addition, Commission proposals to exclude certain products of animal origin from the animal feed chain were considered.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we had already embarked upon a programme of rapid testing of bovine animals in advance of the Commission requirement to do so. In light of recent events on the Continent, I welcome the Commission proposals to expand the requirement for testing and on animal feed, and I will lend my full support for any measures required to provide further consumer protection.</P>
      <P>Of most significance in this debate is the need to protect human health and, in this regard, the Council emphasised the wide range of measures already in place to control BSE and noted the importance of effective implementation of these measures. In Ireland, we already have a broad range of measures for the control and eradication of BSE which exceeds EU and OIE standards in a number of respects. These include the requirement for compulsory notification of the disease, the slaughter and destruction of suspect animals and their herd and birth cohorts, the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from all cattle and sheep and a strictly enforced licensing and control regime for the control of the production, sale and storage of meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>In this regard, it should be noted that the conclusion of the geographical risk assessment of states commissioned by the European Commission and endorsed by its scientific steering committee earlier this year was that Ireland's control system was &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo;. This means that all three main stability factors, feeding, rendering and SRM removal, are in place, well controlled, implemented and audited. Very few countries have achieved this high level of stability. I am confident this independent endorsement of the Irish controls gives consumers of Irish beef at home and abroad every reason to have confidence in the quality and safety of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Side by side with the consumer protection aspects, the current difficult and uncertain market situation must also be addressed. In this regard the Minister has impressed upon Commissioner Fischler the need for appropriate action to support the market. Specifically, he has asked that export refunds be increased to ensure exporting countries, such as Ireland, remain competitive on third country markets. The current difficulties have arisen as a result of a loss of confidence in the product and, unless this is addressed, no amount of market support will suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, I am happy to support the Council's broad endorsement of the Commission's proposals for additional testing and on fallen animals. Discussions are continuing on the <Col N="583" /> details of the Commission proposals. I assure the Deputy that my officials will be fully engaged over coming days in the discussions with the Commission to ensure that the decisions of Council are put into effect in such a way as to restore full confidence in beef throughout the EU in the shortest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time I have raised this issue. The Minister set up the working group to investigate abuse of the elderly last April and I expected that it would have reported to him and the Dáil before now. We see abuse of the elderly on a daily and weekly basis. It is not something to which we are accustomed. We always had respect for the elderly. However, recent court cases have seen people prosecuted for abuse of the elderly. Many elderly people live in isolated areas and in private and public homes where they are abused. There are all types of abuse, as I have pointed out in the House before, and these are increasing daily.</P>
      <P>Action must be taken. If we are serious about taking care of the elderly, we must do something to protect them. It must be recalled that whatever we do for the elderly today, we will be expecting someone else to do for us tomorrow. The Government and its predecessor have failed to deal with this serious problem. I hope that we will see a help-line provided for in the Minister's report. If someone is upset, disturbed and in distress, whether in a public or a private institution, they should be able to make a complaint by telephone to someone who will deal with the matter. An elderly widower whose children have moved away, may find himself isolated and living alone. Such people may find themselves in public institutions and they expect the State and the caring professions to look after them. We have some wonderful people in the caring profession, but like every other sector there are good and bad people in it. We must protect the elderly, however.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming budget should provide more money for services for the elderly. However, money should not be taken away from one area in order to be spent elsewhere. The budget should provide real free travel for the elderly. Something should be done for elderly persons living in isolated rural areas where there are no public transport facilities. They should be able to use their free travel passes in taxis or hackneys. The elderly cannot be expected to depend upon public services that are not there. The free travel pass should mean something.</P>
      <P>The Government should introduce many more initiatives for the elderly, particularly those who are living at home. Old people living alone have two concerns, namely that they will have enough to eat and that they will be warm. The budget should include further initiatives to provide storage heaters or central heating for pensioners living alone. They should not be expected to depend on an open fire which cannot keep them warm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the issue of abuse of the elderly <Col N="584" /> in the Dáil on previous occasions. The working group was established because it was said that over 12,000 elderly people had been abused. That is an outrage. As in Italy, this country always looked after its old people, but recent reports have shown that fewer people are now looking after their elderly parents. More and more elderly people are being placed in nursing homes. The Minister should taken action in that regard in the near future. An inspectorate can inspect private nursing homes at any time, yet there is no such inspectorate for public institutions. It is time to put such an inspectorate on an independent statutory basis so that public and private institutions can be examined. The inspectorate should be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week to deal with such problems.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the generation that went before us, because we will be the next generation of elderly people. We will be judged by the actions we take now, not by what we do in years to come.</P>
    <P>I hope we will see positive results from the report of the working group. On budget day the Government should take positive steps to help the elderly &ndash; the people who put the country where it is today. They made sacrifices during the bad days. Now that we are in good economic conditions, it is time to give them part of the action.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this issue on the Adjournment, and also for his suggestions with regard to the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report, &ldquo;Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study&rdquo;, by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I established a broad-based working group in the autumn of last year to advise me on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. The working group is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, a consultant physician in medicine of old age. The terms of reference of the working group are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations in relation to such of the following matters as it considers appropriate, definitions and terminology, identification and screening procedures, assessment protocols and procedures, management of sensitive information, recording and reporting procedures, inter-agency communications and referral practices, intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact, any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures, training of relevant staff in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors and the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
      <P>The group includes representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda Síochána, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, the Association of Home Help Organisers and voluntary organisations who represent the interests of older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group also includes a consultant physician <Col N="585" /> in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist and a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The group held its first meeting on 12 October 1999. It has drawn up a comprehensive two-year work programme which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, the development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes and the preparation of an evaluation report, culminating in the presentation of a final report to me.</P>
    <P>I am providing significant resources to ensure that the work is completed in the time-frame envisaged. The report will be completed following the testing of draft policies, procedures and guidelines in pilot projects to be introduced in two locations for a period of nine months from January 2001. Training programmes will be provided for staff members and ongoing evaluation will take place. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess whether the draft policies, procedures and guidelines in the identification, assessment and management of elder abuse are appropriately designed and effective in the two health boards areas.</P>
    <P>The report is expected to be completed by the end of 2001 when the evaluated results of the pilot projects are available. The number of submissions received was previously reported to the Deputy as 73, in reply to a parliamentary question dated 10 October 2000. I am advised by the national council that the correct number is 64. I regret that incorrect information was given, due to a breakdown in communication between the national council and my Department. A summary report on the submissions will be included in the working group's report to me.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Disabled Person's Grant Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the previous item, this following matter is very relevant. The disabled person's grant scheme is now 30 years old. It is still funded on a discretionary basis and there is no right to the grant on the basis of need. There is only partial funding in respect of each application. I have raised this matter because of two cases I have come across. I would like to outline the facts to the Minister for his own information, without making a special plea for any case in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One example concerns an application for the grant by somebody who is in receipt of a disabled person's parking permit issued by the Irish Wheelchair Association, together with a letter from an occupational therapist and a letter from a hospital outlining the person's illness. In that case the grant was refused. In another instance a daughter and her husband had moved to live with her father in a local authority house which has since been purchased. Had they not moved in that man would be in a home today or in special care at huge cost to the taxpayer, not to mention the human aspect. They applied to the local authority for a disabled person's grant to provide the necessary accommodation. After a period of months they received a letter informing them that under <Col N="586" /> the terms of the scheme a grant application could not be considered where work had commenced prior to receipt by the council of the application for a grant. This was incorrect; an application had been submitted. As they could not wait, the builder &ndash; if one can find a builder in Dublin, one is lucky &ndash; moved in and commenced the necessary work. This unfortunate couple have to meet the full cost of the alterations.</P>
    <P>We either have a disabled person's grants scheme based on need, rather than bureaucracy, or we do not. In the case of the other application which was refused the person concerned has a parking permit from the Irish Wheelchair Association, a letter from an occupational therapist and another from a hospital. Although eligible for a grant on the basis of their income, they have to fund the full cost of the necessary work, including the cost of preparing plans and other outgoings.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is that each local authority operates the scheme in its functional area and that the rules and regulations vary from local authority to local authority. Two-thirds of the grant issued by a local authority is recouped from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In my local authority area the maximum grant payable is £14,000, for which one would not get a chicken run today. Be that as it may, why should the Department of the Environment and Local Government not have a standard scheme applicable throughout the country with the same rules and regulations and based on need? This would obviate the need for each local authority to include a specified amount in its estimates. Despite the level of need, they do not have the money to pay grants.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to put in place a standard scheme based on need. Even if income limits are introduced, I hope we will reach the stage where the Department of the Environment and Local Government will meet the full cost of the maximum grant payable. As a former member of a local authority and as an ex-Lord Mayor of Cork, the Minister of State is well aware that the majority of those who apply for grants in respect of elderly parents or relatives have very little income.</P>
    <P>I am not making a political point. This scheme has been in place for 30 years. I ask the Minister of State to take it by the scruff of the neck, look at it, put a standard scheme in place and meet the full cost of the maximum grant payable. If he wishes to introduce income limits or a waiver scheme, so be it, but the scheme should apply equally throughout the country. Elderly or disabled persons should not be forced into homes and hospitals at huge expense when children or relatives are prepared to look after them in their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="587" /> Molloy, is unable to be present to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grants scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made thereunder. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme and we have no proposals to amend the regulations in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available from local authorities towards the adaptation of existing houses to meet the needs of disabled persons. The scheme is designed to provide a substantial incentive to carry out necessary adaptations or improvements to dwellings to facilitate disabled persons. A grant of up to 90% of the approved cost of the work is available in the case of a privately owned house while the grant generally covers the actual cost of works to a local authority tenanted dwelling.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the scheme on two occasions since coming into office in December 1998 and again in December 1999. In November 1998 the effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was £8,000 or two-thirds of the approved cost of the works in the case of private houses. Since then the effective maximum grant has been increased to £14,000 or 90% of the approved cost in the case of works commenced on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Typically, the kind of work covered by the scheme would be the provision of downstairs accommodation and services for a wheelchair user or the widening of door openings to allow free access to all the facilities in the dwelling. The grant also extends to work necessary for the proper accommodation and treatment of persons suffering from severe mental illness or severe mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount payable in respect of an individual disabled person's grant is a matter for the local authority concerned. The scheme is funded at local authority level from the authority's own <Col N="588" /> resources and within the constraints imposed by the amount included for that purpose in its estimates of expenditure. It is a matter for the authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in its area, the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. Global expenditure limits are set for the scheme in the form of capital spending allocations from the Department and are based on estimates of demand for the schemes provided by the local authorities. It is open to housing authorities to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department's involvement relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The recoupment by the Department to a local authority is two-thirds of the grant paid. This recoupment rate has also been increased by the Government. In November 1998 local authorities were recouped 50% of grants paid to a maximum of £4,000. Now they are recouped two-thirds of the amount of grant paid up to a maximum of £9,333.</P>
    <P>In cases where an applicant faces a difficulty in meeting his or her portion of the total cost of the works involved local authorities may assist through the provision of a house improvement loan. If an applicant cannot afford to avail of the loan scheme due to the cost of servicing a loan, it is open to a local authority to provide the full cost of the works under the scheme of improvement works <i>in lieu </i>of local authority housing subject to the applicant being approved for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The position on grant assistance to meet the accommodation needs of disabled persons will be kept under review by the Government. I will convey the Deputy's views on certain aspects of the scheme to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. Educational disadvantage is a complex issue, encompassing social and economic issues, which need to be addressed on a number of fronts, both legislative and administrative. Significant progress has been made this year in addressing educational disadvantage in all sectors of education. I will now refer to a number of these.</P>
      <P>In relation to pre-school education, I have recently invited third level institutions to submit proposals for the operation of a pilot project to develop and co-ordinate early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives in the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn.</P>
      <P>At present, I am finalising proposals for a major new three year programme at primary level. This programme will involve the allocation of 200 new teaching posts and financial assistance to schools with the greatest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. A key feature of the new programme is that participating schools must agree, in advance, to target the additional resources being provided at those pupils identified as being at risk of educational disadvantage. Schools will also be given appropriate support for the development of holistic and integrated in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned, in collaboration with other statutory and voluntary services. The programme will cost in excess of £25 million over three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School attendance and retention are issues at the core of educational disadvantage. The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which deals with the <Col N="590" /> problems of non-attendance at school, was enacted last July. With a view to implementing the Act, I have recently invited nominations for appointment to the interim Education Welfare Board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments and I will be in a position to establish the board once all of these have been received.</P>
    <P>I believe that the most likely model of response to succeed, in dealing with early school leaving, is one which involves the community and other statutory agencies, including schools working together, in the provision of services to children and families at risk. This is a key element of the Stay in School initiative under which each school receives funding of up to £40,000 per annum to implement plans, which they themselves help to design. I extended this scheme to another 59 schools earlier this year bringing the total number of schools involved to 117. In addition, I have extended the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative for a further two years involving annual expenditure of £2.3 million.</P>
    <P>In the area of further education, a representative working party has been established to make recommendations on an implementation and funding framework for the back to education initiative. Funding for adult literacy has increased from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £7.825 million in 2000, plus an additional £960,000 for programme development. An interdepartmental group has been examining how best the literacy service can cater for unemployed people. Following successful radio initiatives, I commissioned a TV series of 12 programmes in literacy awareness and tuition for adults, which is being broadcast on RTE 1 at present. As a result of these initiatives, the number of clients catered for annually by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000. The TV series is watched by an average of 172,000 people each week.</P>
    <P>I have initiated the implementation of the first phase of development of an adult guidance service with the establishment of 11 projects. In addition, a White Paper on Adult Education: Learning for Life, was launched in August 2000 setting out a comprehensive strategy and range of actions for the future development of the adult education system, following an extensive consultation process.</P>
    <P>In relation to third level, I have established an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the most effective ways of increasing participation by disadvantaged groups at third level. The group will report to me within three months and its findings will inform future policy in this area. In addition, I expect that a total of £3.428 million will have been spent on special measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at third level by the end of the year. A wide range of measures have been taken to address retention and access issues in the institutes of technology sector including the appointment of access officers in each institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> In the area of special needs provision, a high level planning group in my Department has been working on the development of new arrangements to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for all students with disabilities. I expect to receive the report of this group in the very near future and I can assure the Deputy that I will respond as positively as possible to any proposals which will improve my Department's response to children with special needs. An allocation of £4.25 million has been made to advance this issue.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the multisectoral approach outlined will have a significant and meaningful impact in addressing educational disadvantage and enhancing the life chances of many young people and adults who might not otherwise reach their true potential.</P>

The specifications for the inventory are being drafted at present and it is anticipated that tenders will be sought within the next few months.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, the new planning guidelines in operation for all new building projects since January 2000 make provision for general purposes areas ranging from 91 square metres to 200 square metres, depending on the size of the school. Where an application is made for major capital improvement works by the management authorities of an existing school, it is the policy of my Department to assess the overall future accommodation needs of the school. Where site conditions permit, a general purposes area is included in the planning brief, even when this may not have been the subject of the initial application.</P>

      <Col N="592" /> In regard to the purchase of equipment, my Department has revised the terms of the grant scheme for minor works to national school properties in operation since January 1997. Earlier this year, the level of funding increased from a basic grant of £2,000 to £3,000 per school and from £9 to £10 per pupil on rolls at 30 September. Boards of management may expend this grant on the physical infrastructure of the school or on items of furniture and physical education equipment, depending on their priorities. It is also open to school managers to apply to my Department for grant-aid towards equipment if the cost is outside the scope of the scheme for minor works.</P>

      <P>Primary teachers are appointed by boards of management of the individual schools and, accordingly, I do not have information on the number of schools experiencing difficulties. I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties. A range of measures have been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the difficulties.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates, as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. I increased the total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-7.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further postgraduate course will commence early in 2001 with a proposed intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280. I have decided that the intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1998, primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year persons employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the <Col N="593" /> higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department, will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am aware from a survey undertaken earlier this year by the ASTI that some second level principals have experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. However, the position at second level is complicated by regional and subject variations. A further factor is that vacant positions often require teachers with specific subject combinations. Since August 2000 we have appointed 1,000 second level teachers and the number of applicants was over 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Higher Education Authority have been closely monitoring the situation at second level. Following a survey of principals and graduates completed in 1997, the number of places for the Higher Diploma in Education has increased by 25%. A review of the supply and demand position of second level teachers will continue on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since September 1999, preparations for the introduction of science, as part of social environment and scientific education in the revised primary school curriculum, have been under way. During the 1999-2000 school year, a number of supports were provided for schools: the science curriculum and teacher guidelines were disseminated to all primary teachers; a total of £1.7 million in the form of grants was made available to schools for the purchase of science equipment; a school development planning initiative was launched to assist schools in curriculum planning; and a comprehensive programme of courses for teachers in primary science was run during the summer of 2000.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, as part of the work of the primary curriculum support programme, a developmental project in science has already been initiated with a representative sample of schools. This work will facilitate teachers in exploring the approaches and methodologies and the range of materials necessary for teaching science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is the case with all subjects in the revised primary school curriculum, schools may com<Col N="595" /> mence implementation of science in advance of the formal support programme if they so wish.</P>
    <P>At present, my Department is implementing a range of measures designed to make the physical science subjects more attractive to students at second level including: revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 with an increased emphasis on student practical work &ndash; these changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives; a new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science has been introduced; in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers have been revised &ndash; these changes have been designed to make these examination papers more accessible to the cohort of candidates for whom they are intended and exemplar materials illustrating the changes were distributed to schools at the end of last year; a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of chemistry and physics commenced in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years; and comprehensive reference handbooks in both chemistry and physics, in both printed and CD-ROM formats, have been distributed to all second level schools.</P>
    <P>While the numbers of full-time third level students pursuing science in the broadest sense, including life sciences, physical sciences, maths and statistics and information technology courses have increased over the past decade, to some 20,000 in the 1998-9 academic year, there is evidence of a decline in the numbers taking the physical sciences.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives are now in place to enhance the perception of the physical sciences including: the science, technology and innovation awareness programme which is managed by Forfás; the skills review group under the aegis of the Irish Pharmaceutical and Chemical Manufacturers Federation on which my Department is represented; a physics website to counter the negative image that physics has among school children is being run by the Department of Physics at Trinity College Dublin; and a number of institutes of technology have also initiated a number of schemes at a local level to encourage students to pursue third level science related courses.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level. Its brief is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The work of the task force will range across both second and third levels and will also interact with industry, thus providing insights for students into the many courses and careers that are available to them as a result of a study of the physical sciences. I have <Col N="596" /> requested a report from the task force within three months of its establishment.</P>

      <P>The position generally is that school buses are scheduled to ensure that pupils are transported to school centres in sufficient time for the commencement of the school day. To do otherwise would be unfair to pupils and a source of disruption to the other pupils and teachers in the classroom. It would be of major concern to me and to my Department if pupils were arriving late to school on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The school transport section of my Department was not aware of the problem in Skibbereen. However, inquiries made indicate that the bus in question is a public service scheduled bus and has been arriving late in the centre.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested a full report on the matter from the transport liaison officer, County Cork vocational education committee. I understand that office has already been in contact with Bus Éireann with a view to resolving the matter. The Deputy will be informed of the position as soon as the report has been received.</P>

      <P>The Inner City Organisations Network, ICON, is one of four networks operating within the Dublin Inner City Partnership. The submission referred to by Deputy Gregory was received in my Department early last week and is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>My Department is acutely aware of the extreme educational disadvantage experienced by many people in Dublin's north inner city. As a consequence, my Department directly supports the educational needs of the community served by ICON through funding for schools, including extra funding and staffing for schools with dedicated disadvantaged status in the area. My Department also funds a pre-school. In addition my Department provides support and funding for the following initiatives in the area: home, school and community scheme, breaking the cycle pilot project; stay in school retention initiative; school development planning initiative; Youthreach and VTOS provision; and adult literacy programmes channelled through the City of Dublin VEC, adult and community education and youth services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the Dublin Inner City Partnership is supported in the following ways: a representative of my Department's inspectorate has been assigned to its education and training sub-committee &ndash; this representative supports the planning and development of measures to tackle educational disadvantage in the partnership area; and each partnership has the services of an education co-ordinator funded by my Department and it is open to the group to seek the advice of the co-<Col N="598" /> ordinator with a view to the inclusion of proposals within the overall partnership plan; and a nominee from my inspectorate acts as Department representative for the Dublin north east inner city integrated services process which is part of the ICON area. This nominee regularly meets the chairpersons of the two education task groups of the integrated services process with a view to furthering action on educational matters within my Department. In addition he liaises with the education co-ordinator of the Dublin Inner City Partnership with a view to co-ordinating strategies to combat educational disadvantage in the area. The integrated services process is supporting a more focused and co-ordinated response by statutory agencies to the needs of the local community.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which was published in December 1999, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years. Action is proposed on a wide range of issues, including the promotion of quality of provision, measures to facilitate and encourage parental involvement in their children's early education and the development of a system of evaluation to determine whether providers meet quality standards and to assist them in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no delay in the implementation <Col N="599" /> of the White Paper. Rather, the period since publication has been taken up with consultations and planning in regard to implementation.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, officials of my Department carried out an extensive post-consultation process with all of those who made presentations to the national forum. The aim of the consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper, on a phased basis, in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>Following the consultation process, my Department's officials undertook considerable planning for implementation. Most recently, as an initial move towards implementation, my Department has invited third level institutions to submit proposals for a pilot project to develop early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives in the White Paper. The pilot project will include, in particular, the development of early education quality standards in relation to equipment and materials, staff qualifications, training, learning objectives, methodologies and curriculum; the development of a support framework to encourage compliance with quality standards by early education providers; the co-ordination and enhancement of early education provision with a particular focus on disadvantaged and special needs groups; and the commissioning of a programme of research and development through which best practice in curriculum, teaching methodology and parent involvement may be implemented and evaluated. Following receipt and assessment of these proposals, I hope to be in a position to make further announcements about future developments in the early education area very shortly.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, provides a legislative basis for use of the personal public service number, PPS number, as a unique pupil or student identifier at all levels of education. In May of this year, I announced that the PPS number would be introduced on a phased basis for second level pupils starting in the current school year. My Department has now finalised arrangements with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to assign the number to pupils who entered second level education for the first time in the current school year. Each of the pupils concerned will be issued with a card containing his-her number in early 2001.</P>
      <P>The assignment of the PPS number to all other second level pupils will be phased in over the next two school years. The PPS number will also be used to identify primary pupils and will be assigned in the context of the development, over the next three years, of a new database of these pupils by my Department. The use of the PPS number in tracking the progress of pupils-students through the education system will support programmes to increase retention rates by, for example, providing information on pupils dropping out during their primary school years or failing to make the transition from primary to post-primary education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am highly conscious of the importance of promoting computer literacy among the school-going population and I am implementing a range of measures to address this. The most significant of these is the Schools IT 2000 project. By the end of the current year, £41 million of public money will have been invested in implementing the project. Its aim is to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to equip themselves for participation in the information society. The strategies being used to achieve this ambitious objective are the provision of assistance to every first and second level school in building up its technology infrastructure, the development of teacher skills and the establishment of support services. In a recent survey more than 95% of schools stated that they are using the Internet and 34,000 teachers stated that they attended one or more IT training courses since early 1998. These facts provide a measure of the excellent progress made to date and work ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within schools the emphasis is on developing computer literacy across the curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to use the modern technologies to enhance their teaching. Pupils at both first and second levels are being afforded growing opportunities to gain &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience of computers in order to develop their skills. Many programmes on offer in schools such as the transition year, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied include modules in information technology. The computer studies option is available to leaving certificate students who, upon successful completion of a one-year course, are awarded a certificate from my Department. Schools are increas<Col N="603" /> ingly able to provide such opportunities for their pupils as a result of the Schools IT 2000 initiative.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has recently produced a set of guidelines on the use of information and communication technologies in learning and teaching. These will be issued to all schools in the near future. The NCCA is also examining the feasibility of introducing computer studies-computer science as a subject for the leaving certificate. It has commissioned an impact study to investigate this and it will be in a position to advise me in this respect shortly.</P>

      <P>There are three leaving certificate physical science subjects, namely physics, chemistry and a subject that combines elements of physics and chemistry. This latter subject is known as physics and chemistry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on enrolments for the 1999-2000 school <Col N="604" /> year, the total number of schools providing the leaving certificate programme was 730. Of these, 162 did not provide physics, 202 did not provide chemistry and 638 did not provide the combined subject &ndash; physics and chemistry. In percentage terms, this means that 22% of the schools did not provide physics, 28% did not provide chemistry and 87% did not provide the combined subject &ndash; physics and chemistry.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently implementing a number of measures to increase the uptake of the physical sciences at senior cycle. These include the following: additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided to schools. It is estimated that these grants will total in excess of £4.6 million in the current year; a special annual <i>per capita</i> grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry has been introduced; schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. For all other schools that offer the physical science subjects, consideration is being given to the possibility of providing an all-in grant to these schools to fund an upgrade of laboratories early in 2001; revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000; a review of the junior certificate science syllabus is being undertaken by the NCCA, particularly in respect of the physics and chemistry content of the syllabus; a new physical science syllabus to replace the present combined physics and chemistry syllabus is being prepared by the NCCA; a new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science has been introduced. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised; a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry is now in its second year; increased provision has been made for pre-service training for teachers of physics and chemistry; comprehensive reference handbooks in both physics and chemistry have been produced and distributed to all second level schools. These handbooks have been provided in both printed and electronic formats.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level. The task force, to be chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, will provide an initial report to me in three months' time. Its brief is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The work of the task force will complement and support the measures currently being implemented by my Department.</P>

      <P>Breaking the Cycle is a five-year pilot project. It began in September 1996 in 33 urban and 123 rural schools that have high concentrations of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The operation of the project is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate and is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. A key objective of the review process is to establish the appropriateness and effectiveness of the distinct approaches to urban and rural disadvantage, which are being tested under the pilot project. However, it would not be appropriate to make decisions concerning the future of the project on the basis of interim evaluation findings. Such decisions will be made when the project has ended and the evaluation process has been completed.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in primary schools. To this end, I am currently finalising a tailored package of resources for each school with significant concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. I will be making a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. The examinations were made more inclusive this year by allowing a student, depending on his or her special need, have his or her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that subject. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and the examination certificates issued by my Department will state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This new measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his or her special need precludes him or her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. The change made this year aligns our examination system with best international practice where changes to standard assessment that arise as a result of granting the assistance of readers and scribes are enabled by including an explanatory note on the examination certificate.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of children with aspergers syndrome, which is a form of high func<Col N="607" /> tioning autism, will be addressed by the task force on autism to which the Deputy refers. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a task force has also been established to address the educational needs of children with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>My decision to establish task forces to review the two specific areas of autism and dyslexia was based on my concern to address a range of particular difficulties which have arisen in relation to educational provision for children suffering from these conditions. However, the establishment of task forces in these two particular areas does not in any way suggest a diminution in my concern for the educational needs of children in other special needs categories, including the categories mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I would point out that a high level planning group has been working in my Department on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of education for all students with special needs. The objective is to develop a system which is fully responsive to the needs of all children with disabilities and which is supported by a level of research and expertise which will ensure the delivery of a service which is in line with best international practice in all disability areas.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the very near future and I can assure the Deputy that I will respond as positively as possible to any measure which will contribute to ensuring that all children with special needs receive the support they require, irrespective of the level of need involved or their location.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, provides a psychological service to all second level schools, excluding those served by the two vocational education committees for the city and county of Dublin, who each have their own psychological service. There were 353,860 students in second level schools in the school year 1999-2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the school year 1999-2000, the average number of second level students met for the purpose of individual casework was 89 per psychologist. Twenty-six additional psychologists have been appointed to NEPS between 4 September <Col N="608" /> and 20 October. They are currently engaged in a programme of induction training and will shortly be assigned to schools.</P>
    <P>The management committee of NEPS submitted a draft development plan to me in April of this year. Under the terms of this plan, newly appointed psychologists will be deployed as follows: approximately two-thirds of their time will be devoted to expansion of the service in the primary sector and approximately one-third to the improvement of the level of service in the second-level sector. Recruitment to NEPS will continue until a full complement of educational psychologists has been reached. Over this period student ratios will be systematically reduced and by the end of the development period most NEPS psychologists will be serving approximately 5,000 students.</P>
    <P>These steps were taken to address the current situation where 17 NEPS psychologists are deployed exclusively in the post-primary sector. Five more psychologists, who mainly work in the primary sector, also serve a number of post-primary schools. A number of the 17 psychologists also have managerial responsibilities. The number of schools assigned to each psychologist ranges therefore from 18 to 54, the average number of schools per psychologist being 39.</P>

      <P>As the primary educators, parents have a critical role to play in their children's education. This is underpinned by the provisions of Article 42.1 of the Constitution. A number of measures have been taken or encouraged by my Department to enhance the role of parents in their children's education. These include: the setting up of the National Parents' Council to facilitate participation by parents in consultations with the Government and other education partners about the development of educational policies; the payment of an annual grant towards the expenses of the council which operates in two tiers, primary and post-primary; representation of parents on the boards of management of schools and on vocational education committees; the establishment of parents' associations in schools; the development of home/school/community liaison schemes; representation of parents on the senior and junior cycle committees of the NCCA; and the school development planning initiative, &ndash; SDPI &ndash; for schools was established on a pilot basis in 1999 and will be extended on a phased basis to encompass all schools by 2002. The initiative encourages the involvement of parents in the school planning process.</P>
      <P>Parents are represented on the consultative group that oversees the implementation of the initiative. Other measures include: close consultation with parents in the development of each school's behaviour and discipline policies; regular formal meetings between parents and school management; distribution of departmental circulars to parents through the parents' associations; a central role for parents in breaking the cycle pilot project &ndash; this pilot project currently operates in 32 urban schools and 122 rural schools; and parents are key partners in the early start pilot project &ndash; the early start pre-school pilot project operates in 40 primary schools with a total of 56 classes.</P>
      <P>My Department actively encourages parental involvement in the education of their children and will continue to do so. As the recognised primary educators of the child, parents have a right to be assured that the child's needs are being met by the school. Parents should be given as much information as possible on all aspects of the child's progress and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A concrete example of my Department's <Col N="610" /> resolve in this regard is the recently published guidelines for parents on the revised primary school curriculum entitled &ldquo;Your Child's Learning&rdquo;. Copies of these guidelines which are intended to assist parents in enhancing their children's education have been distributed to all parents of primary school children through the school network.</P>

      <Quest>the action he is taking to deal with the unsafe levels of radon found in many schools during recent surveys; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to conduct a survey of radon levels in schools in 1998. All schools recognised by my Department were invited to participate. The survey is being conducted in three phases. The results of phase I of the survey were forwarded to the participating schools in January this year. Earlier this month, the results of phase II of the survey were forwarded to schools in the counties participating in that phase. Phase III of the survey is under way at present and the results are expected next year.</P>
      <P>In May this year the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 &ndash; Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000 &ndash; gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive &ndash; Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM. This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three-month period. If radon exceeds this level an employer must evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Remedial measures are complete in 13 of the worst affected schools that participated in phase I of the survey and arrangements are in place to carry out remedial work in a further 20 schools before the end of this year. Preparations are being made to have remedial work carried out in another 20 schools with maximum radon levels in a range between 404 bqMf7&gt;3 and 573 bqMf7&gt;3.</P>
      <P>Prior to the commencement of the survey my Department had set a reference level 200 bequerels per cubic metre above which remedial measures to mitigate radon levels would be undertaken. This reference level is the same as that above which the Government, in 1990, advised that mitigation measures should be considered in domestic dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pilot study of the natural ventilation in ten schools with maximum radon levels of between 200 bqMf7&gt;3 and 400 bqMf7&gt;3 is under way at present. The purpose of the study is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in this range, as opposed to the <Col N="611" /> mechanical systems that have been, or are in the process of being, installed in the schools with higher levels. The results of the study are expected in January 2001 and these will allow my Department to plan a mitigation programme for the schools with maximum radon levels in excess of 200 bqMf7&gt;3 but not exceeding 400 bqMf7&gt;3. Meanwhile, my Department is advising schools that increasing the natural ventilation in affected rooms, where this can be achieved without discomfort to the users of those rooms, may be effective in reducing the level of radon.</P>
    <P>The results of phase II of the survey have just been published. My Department will put arrangements in place within the next few weeks to have remedial work carried out in the participating schools in phase II of the survey with maximum radon levels in excess of 400 bqMf7&gt;3.</P>

      <Quest>the procedures involved in dealing with disruptive pupils at second level schools; the plans he has to establish posts of teacher counsellors to assist schools in this regard; if his attention has been drawn to the serious stress and time involved to teachers in dealing with these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Individual school managerial authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules and procedures, is drawn up and applied in schools. Circumstances vary from one school community to another, and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools. However, my Department has issued guidelines to schools outlining the general principles to be followed in drawing up and implementing a code of behaviour in schools.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, requires schools to prepare a code of behaviour which will specify the types of behaviour requiring disciplinary measures, the nature of these measures and the procedures to be followed by school authorities. The code is to be prepared in accordance with guidelines which may be issued by the National Education Welfare Board, which is to be established under the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>The enactment of this Act, together with the implementation of the Education Act, 1998, will introduce a new legislative framework for dealing with school discipline issues generally and provide an opportunity to update existing guidelines where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher counsellor project was initiated in 1995 in a number of schools at primary level in the Tallaght/Clondalkin area and in Dublin's north inner city. Teacher posts were assigned to assist in supporting pupils with very disruptive <Col N="612" /> behaviour. Following an evaluation of the project in 1998, the title of the project was changed to the support teacher project and a revised specification for the role of the teachers involved was introduced in January 1999.</P>
    <P>These teachers support a small group of primary level pupils who display the most disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour at any given time. They also have a specific role in supporting the development of school policy in relation to children's behaviour and formulating management strategies for the support of children experiencing behavioural difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are no immediate plans to extend the project to schools at second level. Every second school level receives provision for remedial/learning support and guidance counselling within its teacher allocation. In addition, it is open to the authorities of individual second level schools to apply to my Department for a concessionary increase in the approved teacher allocation to cater for particular difficulties and assessed needs within the school. Each such application is considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the existing provision within the school in question.</P>

      <P>Teachers do valuable work and should be paid accordingly. I have been to the forefront in acknowledging the contribution teachers have made, and continue to make, to the development of education in Ireland, which in turn has contributed greatly to our present state of economic well-being. It is essential that the pay and other <Col N="613" /> conditions of employment applying to teachers should be such as to continue to attract young men and women of the highest calibre and ability to the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>In terms of improvements in pay and other conditions of service, teachers have been treated as favourably as other public servants and obtained the full benefits of all national agreements over the past ten years. However, I understand the feeling of teachers and other public servants that their contribution to the present economic prosperity should be rewarded on a par with other groups of comparable workers.</P>
      <P>It is the partnership process more that than any other single factor that has delivered the state of economic prosperity that we now enjoy. The aspirations of all public service employees, including teachers, can be achieved through the partnership process and through the arrangements agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I know that the majority of the public service unions, including two of the teacher unions, consider that the public service benchmarking body provides a means by which public service employees can achieve their goals of equal treatment with the private sector and people in comparable employment. I am also confident that the benchmarking process can ensure that the pay and conditions applying to teachers in the future will remain comparable with other graduate professions and prove attractive to new entrants to the profession.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present concentrating on the areas of major development and population growth with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional educational facilities exists or is likely to arise in the future. As part of this process, officials of the planning and building unit consult regularly with local authorities regarding development proposals and their implications. Liaison with existing schools is important, also, and the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</P>
      <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High quality temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, since this Government came into office there have been very substantial increases in the levels of capital funding for school accommodation. As a result, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of educational infrastructure at both first and second level.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, of my Department currently deploys one educational psychologist in primary schools in County Mayo. In the school year 1999-2000 the number of pupils of primary school age in the county was 14,528. This includes children with special needs in mainstream schools and children in special schools, many of whom already have access to psychological services provided by the relevant health board and voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>The planning group whose report recommended the establishment of NEPS estimated that 11.2% of school-children might need individual support from a psychologist at some stage of their school career. Following interviews conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners I appointed 26 additional psychologists to the agency between 4 September and 20 October. They are currently engaged in a programme of induction training and will shortly be assigned to schools. Two of these psychologists will be involved in the expansion of the service to schools in County Mayo.</P>

      <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish, before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department of Education and Science, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition, these teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers. I recently extended the period of provisional recognition from three to five years in order to allow these teachers adequate time to prepare for and pass the Irish language examination, and also in response to the ongoing teacher supply issue at primary level.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, teachers trained outside of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, are now also being granted a five year period of provisional recognition to allow them to teach in mainstream classes in primary schools. I introduced this change from 1 September of this year, in view of the current shortage of qualified primary teachers, and it will apply until September 2002, at which stage it will be reviewed. In common with EU trained teachers, non-EU teachers will be required to work towards achieving the Irish language qualification during their period of provisional recognition. Non-EU trained teachers will be remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during their period of provisional recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> In addition, a number of changes have been made to the Irish qualification examination, aimed at assisting teachers trained outside the State to obtain the Irish language qualification. The most important of these are: the extension of the period of provisional recognition from three to five years. As the exam is held twice a year, candidates will have ten opportunities to sit the examination during their period of provisional recognition; the examination now comprises four individual modules and teachers can prepare for and sit different modules at different times. Teachers who pass an individual module will be exempt from that module for a period of five years; courses are being provided, through the education centre network, to facilitate teachers preparing for the examination.</P>
    <P>At second level a change regarding the Irish requirement for appointment as a teacher has come into effect from the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. There is no longer an Irish language requirement in the case of the generality of teachers who are not required to use Irish in their ordinary daily duties. The requirement remains in the case of the following second level teachers: those employed in Gaeltacht schools, those employed in schools where Irish is the normal medium of instruction, in the case of subjects other than Irish and those who teach any subject other than Irish through the medium of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers was concerned with the educational entitlements of Jamie Sinnott, a young man who is suffering from severe autism and profound mental and physical disablement. The case dealt with a range of complex issues and the judgment of the court has very significant implications, not just for the education of children with special needs but, more generally, for the education system.</P>
      <P>The court held that Mr. Sinnott was entitled to an education service for so long as he could benefit from it. The judgment would, therefore, appear to extend the provisions of the Constitution relating to the education of children, to the education of adults with disabilities similar to that of the plaintiff and to other adults, generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court also awarded damages of £200,000 to <Col N="619" /> Mr. Sinnott and £50,000 to his mother. As part of this award, the court ordered that the State make an immediate payment of £42,000 to Mrs. Sinnott to enable her to put a home based education service in place for her son. It also ordered the immediate payment of a further £15,000 to cover expenses already incurred by Mrs. Sinnott in catering for her son. These payments have already been made.</P>
    <P>The case also highlighted the State's failure over many years to make adequate provision for the education of some children with special needs. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to remedy these deficiencies. As a first step in this process, I have already announced a range of new developments in this area, including the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism, and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>I am also appointing an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in this area and to liaise with the work of the special task force on autism which I recently established and which has been requested to report to me within three months. I am also appointing a clinical psychologist to advise on the needs of individual children with autism.</P>
    <P>The measures which I am now putting in place are intended to provide a basis for the development of an appropriate range of responses to the needs of children with autism.</P>
    <P>However, elements of the judgment in the case to which the Deputy refers have raised issues which are of such importance to the education system and generally to the system of State administration that they require clarification by the Supreme Court. The Government considers that it has an obligation, in the public interest, to clarify these matters and establish precisely what is the range of the State's duty in this matter. The Government has therefore decided to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court and to cover costs of both parties in seeking clarification of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The appeal will focus exclusively on legal and constitutional issues and it would be entirely wrong to characterise the appeal as an effort to deny services to Jamie Sinnott. Indeed, as indicated above, arrangements are already being made to ensure that Jamie and his mother receive the services ordered by the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
      <P>One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in the larger schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Remuneration levels for secretaries under this scheme, as for secretaries and caretakers employed in the comprehensive and community and VEC school sectors, range from £12,675 to £23,657 in the case of secretaries and range from £12,805 to £15,176 in the case of caretakers.</P>
      <P>The 1978 scheme has been superseded under the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive scheme that provides grants to primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. This scheme provides a grant to schools, which is not related to any particular pay scale. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The level and extent of the service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers concerned are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the remuneration levels and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the employer.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties of many deaf students in integrating into mainstream education; the plans he has to introduce introductory courses in sign language for all students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group, either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for the individual child, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communication system, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English. <Col N="621" /> If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
    <P>If the option is for Irish signed language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is a growing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium of communication and teaching. Special needs assistants, who are proficient in sign language, have also been provided for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultations with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and individuals, including individual parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has also been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also being made to establish a representative advisory committee which will offer guidance to my Department on key future developments in relation to the education of the deaf. The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to sign language and communication with non deaf children will be considered in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority commissioned the Educational Research Centre at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin, to undertake a survey of completion rates in undergraduate degree courses in the seven universities. The survey commenced in March 2000 and the target group surveyed consisted of first-time entrants in the 1992-93 academic year. This year was selected <Col N="622" /> on the basis that it was recent enough to be relevant to present rates of non-completion but yet allowed adequate time for students to complete even while repeating one or more years.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the study are to assess the percentage of students who complete university courses; whether there were differences in completion rates between fields of study; whether courses with high CAO entry requirements affect course completion; whether there are substantial differences between males and females; what happens to students who do not progress to second year; and what can be said about those who do leave the system.</P>
      <P>I understand that the study is approaching completion and that the data are at present being verified by the universities. The universities have also been requested to provide information for inclusion in the final report as to what measures they are taking to address the position with regard to retention. It is anticipated that the findings of the study will be publicly available by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>At the request of my Department, the council of directors of institutes of technology commissioned the Education Research Centre to undertake a comprehensive study of the issue of non-completion in the institutes. The study consists of two phases: a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four-year period; a qualitative study of students' attitudes.</P>
      <P>The research aims of the study include: the collection and analysis of statistical data on enrolments, retention and output rates for institutes from 1995-96 to 1998-99 inclusive; appropriate qualitative studies; the establishment of the major factors influencing retention rates; an examination of relevant studies including international studies in this area and the presentation of a report to the national committee.</P>
      <P>Preliminary work began by the ERC on the project in April 1998. The first phase of the study was presented at a special meeting of the council of directors at the end of August 2000. It is expected that the report on the first phase will be formally presented to my Department shortly. The second phase of the study commenced at the beginning of November 2000 and is expected to be completed in May 2001.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to my plans for a major new initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority for my Department. My objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in school. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified. To this end, I will be allocating 200 extra new teaching posts to primary schools shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this initiative is that, earlier this year, all primary schools were invited to participate in a survey of educational disadvantage. The Educational Research Centre issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all schools, together with guidance on its completion. The closing date for the return of the questionnaires was extended <Col N="624" /> following representations from schools and others in this regard. The ERC and my Department provided clarification to schools in relation to particular aspects of the questionnaire, where this was requested. In some cases, delay arose because it was also necessary to obtain clarification concerning data supplied by schools.</P>
    <P>The analysis by the ERC of the responses received has now been completed and will be provided to me shortly. The survey identifies those schools that have significant concentrations of pupils with background characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. I will allocate the 200 new teaching posts and make grant allocations to the schools identified shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting fully qualified teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary teachers are appointed by boards of management of the individual schools and <Col N="625" /> accordingly I do have information in regard to the number of schools experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures have been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post graduate course will commence early in 2001 with a proposed intake of 280 students.</P>
    <P>It is projected that the intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year persons employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire and the AMI which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>An additional 1,000 posts are being created at second level in the current school year. A proportion of these posts are being utilised to facili<Col N="626" /> tate the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The remainder of the posts are being targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied and the junior certificate school programme and the stay in school retention initiative.</P>
    <P>A further 200 posts will be allocated in each of the next two school years in accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>It is open to the authorities of individual second level schools to apply to my Department for a concessionary increase in the approved teacher allocation to cater for particular difficulties within the school. Each such application is considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the existing provision within the school in question.</P>
    <P>Apart from those posts which are allocated to a school in respect of a specific programme or service, it is a matter for the school authority concerned to determine how the teaching resources are to be utilised having regard to the curricular and other needs of the pupils in the school. Similarly, where a vacancy arises, it is a matter for the school authority to decide on the subject areas to be catered for.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At second level, the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in second level schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in the larger schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Pay scales for secretaries under this scheme, as for secretaries and caretakers employed in the comprehensive and community and VEC school sectors, are determined centrally. Increases under the Pro<Col N="627" /> gramme for Prosperity and Fairness have been applied to these scales.</P>
    <P>The 1978 scheme has been superseded, under the PESP agreement of 1992, by a more extensive scheme that provides grants to secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. This scheme provides a grant to schools, which is not related to any particular pay scale. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The level and extent of the service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. The question of the application of the national agreements in these cases is a matter for the management authorities of the schools and the employees.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund which I introduced recently. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards school funding. My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level.</P>

      <P>I am committed to ensuring that all children with autism have access to the support services they require within the education system.</P>
      <P>In keeping with this commitment, I recently announced a range of new measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services available for children with autism. These measures include the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also appointing an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in <Col N="628" /> this area and to liaise with the work of the special task force on autism, which I recently established, and which has been requested to report to me within three months. I am also appointing a clinical psychologist to advise on the needs of individual children with autism.</P>

      <P>The recently published report by Professor Pat Clancy and Ms Joy Wall entitled The Social Background of Higher Education Entrants and the previous reports in this series allow us to track the changing social background of entrants to higher education in Ireland over almost two decades.

      <P>The report indicates that the overall rate of admission to higher education has risen from 20% in 1980 to 46% in 1998. Most social groups have experienced a progressive increase in the proportion going on to higher education as shown in the table below.</P>

    <P>The highest proportionate increase has occurred for those social groups which had very low participation rates in 1980. However it is clear that there are still six of the 11 social groups where less that 40% of the relevant population enter higher education.</P>
    <P>Three crucial schooling transition points have been identified at which the effects of social background are significant. Students from lower socio-economic groups are significantly less likely to complete second level education; those who sit the leaving certificate tend to achieve significantly lower grades; and for students with modest levels of performance in the leaving certificate, those from higher socio-economic groups have higher transfer to higher education.</P>
    <P>In a report published by the Higher Education <Col N="630" /> Authority in 1999 entitled Declining a Third Level Offer, Professor Clancy identified the main factors, cited by respondents to a survey, in not accepting the offer of a third level place made through the Central Admissions Office. The largest percentage of respondents, 37%, mentioned that they were unhappy with the place or places offered through the CAO. A further 23.3% mentioned that their decision not to accept was caused by a change of mind about career plans or other career reasons, while a further 12% of respondents mentioned that they were concerned about the financial costs of going to college.</P>
    <P>In September this year I announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three disadvantaged groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. It will, <i>inter alia</i>, advise on the development of targeted interventions and actions at all levels. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups &ndash; students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act was enacted on 5 July 2000. The Act itself provides that all of its provisions must be commenced within two years of enactment.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for the raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16, or the completion of three years of post primary education, whichever is the later. It also provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments. I will be in a position to establish the designate board once all of these have been received.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff recruitment and retention of staff is a challenge facing all employers in the public and private sectors in the current economic situation. I am aware of reports that it is more difficult than heretofore to fill available posts in the education sector particularly in certain areas.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. A range of measures has been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-00 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post-graduate course will commence early in 2001 with a proposed intake of 280 students. It is projected that the intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the survey undertaken earlier this year by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, which indicated that some second level schools had experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. An additional 1,000 teaching posts are being allocated in the second level sector in the current year. My Department is not aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in 1997 indicated that there are regional and subject variations. Schools in certain locations have more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects, especially Irish, may pose particular difficulties. These findings are confirmed by the data in the ASTI survey. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second <Col N="633" /> level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Higher Education Authority have been monitoring the situation carefully. The total number of places on the higher diploma in education course has increased by 25% since 1997-98. Quotas were set aside in 1998 for specific areas including Irish. The Department and the Higher Education Authority are continuing to review the supply and demand of second-level teachers on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years a range of measures has been implemented which have a positive impact on the supply and retention of teachers. These include increased number and proportion of permanent teaching posts; retention of supernumerary posts in the teaching service; improvement of access to teacher pension schemes; new management structure for schools with a significant increase in promotion posts for teachers; increased allowances for posts of responsibility; new management structure for schools which deliver adult education programmes; employee assistance service for teachers in certain areas; new career break and job sharing arrangements; in career development for teachers; third level course fee refund scheme; qualifications allowances for all recognised teachers; recognition of qualifications for permanent appointment in vocational preparation and training courses; easing of Irish requirement for the generality of teachers; and extension and improvement of incremental credit arrangements including full credit for reckonable teaching service given in the EU.</P>
    <P>I understand the Higher Education Authority has not been formally advised by any university of serious difficulties in staff recruitment or retention. However, the authority has advised that in common with other sectors of the economy, it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain clerical staff and personnel for posts in IT areas. I understand also that institutes of technology are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting and retaining clerical staff and staff for certain posts in areas such as information technology, electrical and electronic engineering. My Department is keeping the situation under review in conjunction with the management authorities of the institutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that all schools catering for children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to meet the needs of the children in question. </P>
      <P>As far as the provision of teaching and other staffing resources is concerned, the reality is that this Government has undertaken an unprecedented level of development in special education services.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of the level of need involved. Already, as a result of this development, the number of resource teachers deployed to support children with special needs in integrated settings in primary schools has increased from 104 to more than 560. Also, over the same period, the number of special needs assistants allocated to schools to help children with special needs has grown from 299 to more than 1,400. My Department is continuing to expand these services in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the pupil teacher ratios and special needs assistant support levels applicable in all special schools and special classes catering for children with special needs have been reduced to the levels recommended by the special education review committee. Pupils attending such facilities also attract significantly increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>Also, since September 1999 the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower ratios are free to seek access to the service where they can demonstrate a need for such support.</P>
      <P>Schools catering for children with special needs also have access to funding for the purchase of specialised equipment required to assist in the education of the children. In the current year a sum of £1,345,000 has been provided to fund such equipment.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide all new schools with access facilities and special toilets to cater for disabled students. In the architectural design of emergency evacuation routes, account is also taken of the requirements of students with disabilities. New schools of two or more stories are provided with lifts. The school authorities are advised of accessibility requirements by my Department and the relevant design teams during the architectural planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Established schools which make applications for grant aid towards the provision of access and other facilities for the physically disabled, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, are also grant aided by my Department from the capital allocations for primary and post primary buildings. Primary schools may also use the funds available under the grant scheme for minor works to school <Col N="635" /> properties to carry out minor infrastructural adaptations to cater for disabled pupils. </P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to build on the above development and to ensure that all schools catering for children with special needs are given the support they require to carry out this very important role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 October 2000 the Government decided in principle to set up a body to award compensation to people who suffered abuse in institutions. Since that decision officials my Department have been working, together with other relevant Departments, to bring forward a set of proposals which will provide in detail for the composition and operation of the body. Part of that process involves consultation with groups representing victims of abuse and they have been invited to meet with officials of my Department. It will also be necessary to seek the views of the commission to inquire into child abuse, to an extent that will not compromise its operation. While it is not possible to say at this stage precisely when the compensation body will be set up, I can assure the Deputy that my Department is dealing with all issues relating to the setting up of the body as a matter of high priority.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy is correct in stating that I, as Minister for Education and Science, am a defendant in a number of High Court actions relating to past abuse it is also the case that the State generally is a defendant. If there were a conflict of interest of the kind to which the Deputy refers then the implication would be that no State body would be in a position to bring forward legislation in this matter. I am, however, completely satisfied that no such conflict of interest arises. I am also satisfied that my Department, having been closely involved from the start with the development of a programme of measures to address the needs of victims of abuse, is in the best position to bring forward the necessary legislation on a compensation body.</P>

      <P>In 1996, following an extensive period of research, the Deloitte &amp; Touche Report on Insurance Costs in Ireland was published. The report indicated that high insurance costs in Ireland were related to high claims costs. In particular, the report found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group. The report also noted that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>Although this report remains a valuable source of information about insurance costs in Ireland, I re-established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998 to provide me with more up to date information on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
      <P>From the information available from the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, clearly, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>
      <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group, set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report it is hoped to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The most recent road accident report published by the National Roads Authority for 1998 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver, on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the most effective way of ensuring that <Col N="640" /> the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all EU member states has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, became law on 1 April 2000. The Act applies to all employees except the following categories of employees who are excluded from its provisions: </P>
      <P>(i)close relative of the employer such as a spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother and sister;</P>
      <P>(ii)apprentices within the meaning of the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and Labour Services Act, 1987 &ndash; other apprentices are covered.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, an employee means a person of any age who has entered into or works or has worked under a contract of employment. A contract of employment means a contract of service or apprenticeship or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person or a third person &ndash; whether or not the third person is a party to the contract. </P>
      <P>If a dispute exists as to the application of the Act the matter may be referred for investigation to a rights commissioner or to the labour inspectorate section of my Department in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Act.

      <P>Basically, the strategy behind doing away with price controls <Col N="641" /> reflects the view taken by all Governments over the last decade or so that inflation is best curbed and consumer interests are best served by the operation of competition in the marketplace. Experience, both in this country and internationally, supports this view. I have no plans to reintroduce price controls. Rather, I believe that our efforts should focus on promoting competition right across the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January, 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc &ndash; formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.</P>
      <P>Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income until 31 December 1991. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc.</P>
      <P>The Government levy which at present applies to insurance policies is a general stamp duty, the proceeds of which go to the Exchequer and not to the insurance compensation fund. Any review of the current levy is, therefore, a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Middle East which has already taken an appalling toll of life and put in jeopardy the Middle East peace process in which so many hopes have been placed. I have extended our deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have been killed and to those who were injured. I also made statements on 2 and 12 October and a full statement to the Dáil on 19 October concerning the current crisis.</P>
      <P>The Government has made clear its position to both sides, both at ministerial and official level. We deplore all acts of violence and have called on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to avoid further escalation. In particular, we have called on Israel to end the use of military force in dealing with Palestinian protests where civilian policing methods would be more appropriate. I have assured both sides of our support for the Sharm-el-Sheikh agreement and all efforts to restore calm and to find a peaceful solution. I have underlined the need for both sides to act quickly to reach agreement in the peace process and to avert the danger that this conflict might extend further. The first priority, as agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, must be to end the violence. The objective must remain the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, which must necessarily recognise both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's right to live in peace and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met last month with Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior, a special emissary of Prime Minister Barak, and stressed the need for maximum restraint and encouraged him to join with the Palestinians in rebuilding trust and confidence, mutual respect, parity of esteem and a spirit of partnership. I also reminded him of the very concrete contribution we have made to peace in the region through our participation in UN peace<Col N="645" /> keeping in Lebanon where the safety of our troops is of paramount concern.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles last week to express the Government's concerns, speaking with both the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Shlomo Ben-Ami, and the Palestinian Minister for International Cooperation, Dr Nabil Sha'ath.</P>
    <P>Ireland has fully supported the European Union in its ongoing efforts to diffuse the crisis and in its active encouragement of Israeli and Palestinian leaders to come together and work for a ceasefire. The General Affairs Council in Brussels yesterday called again on both sides to fully implement the points agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh and in subsequent meetings. In particular, it called on Israel to withdraw its forces from Palestinian territories to the positions they occupied before the current crisis and to end the use of military force. It also called for an end to the economic sanctions and the restriction of movement on Palestinian territories. At the same time, the EU called on the Palestinian Authority to do all it can to end the violence. The EU made clear its willingness to assist in efforts to end the current violence and allow a return to the peace process.</P>
    <P>If a cessation of violence is to take hold and remain in place, it will be essential to move quickly to rebuild trust and confidence. This will not be an easy task but it is a vital one. We, with our EU partners, have supported the commission of inquiry agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, on which EU High Representative Javier Solana will represent the European Union, and would hope to see the commission on the ground and active as soon as possible. It is important that the investigation into what has happened must be as open, thorough and transparent as possible.</P>

      <P>While the investigation of the use of biofuel and bioenergy technologies as renewable forms of energy has being ongoing over many years, it is widely acknowledged that further research and development is required before the technologies reach commercial availability in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which was published by me in September 1999, calls for the investigation and testing of alternative fuels, new technologies and innovative systems. More recently, the national climate change strategy, published by my colleague, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has restated the call for measures to <Col N="646" /> limit the rate of increase in overall fuel consumption and the need to encourage a switch to alternative, cleaner and more CO2 efficient fuels.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have secured funding of £146 million under the national development plan for energy related expenditure, including £40 million for energy research and development. The funding will be used to devise a strategy for this area which will consist of a mixture of the following approaches: a public good fully funded research programme in co-operation with universities and research institutions; a shared cost programme to be carried out with industry to exploit commercial opportunities; and international collaborative research.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the development of alternative forms of energy such as biofuels and bioenergy will feature under one or more of the above approaches. In that context, the Irish Energy Centre, which is co-funded by my Department, is preparing a three year research and development work programme with the objective of achieving the most effective outcome at least cost. The programme will be funded as part of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that EU regulations will unduly impede the development of these energy sources. However, until the high production cost of these alternative forms of energy are reduced they will continue to have a limited impact on the overall energy market.</P>

      <P>The specifications which must be met by air carriers with an interest in operating the Derry/Dublin PSO route were published in the EU Official Journal on 15 September and 28 September 2000. Those specifications include a requirement for at least two daily return flights, seven days per week and the schedule involved should provide for an early morning departure from Derry to Dublin and a late evening return from Dublin to Derry. The minimum daily seating capacity to be provided is 50 seats each way and the aircraft to be used on the route must have a seating capacity of at least 30 seats.</P>
      <P>The published specifications also refer to the range of fares that may be charged on the route. These provide for a maximum return fare of IR£97 in respect of 40% of the daily seat capacity. A further 40% of daily seat capacity is to be provided at IR£87 or lower while the remaining 20% of seats are not subject to fare restrictions.</P>
      <P>The invitation to air carriers to tender for the Derry/Dublin route, and for five other PSO routes, was published in the EU Official Journal on 16 September 2000. The closing date for submission of tenders was 17 October 2000. In all, four airlines submitted tenders covering the six PSO routes and these are currently being evaluated by my Department. In accordance with Regulation 2408/92, copies of the tenders have been sent to the EU Commission and a period of two months must elapse after the deadline for submission of tenders before any selection is made. Our aim is to secure the completion of all necessary procedures in time to ensure commencement of the Derry/Dublin PSO service as planned in mid-January 2001.</P>

      <P>On 7 April 1998 the Government approved a trade sale of 100% of Cablelink, which was 75% owned by Telecom Éireann and 25% by RTE.</P>
      <P>An information memorandum, which outlines Cablelink's existing businesses, plans for its future development, the current regulatory environment and a financial overview, was sent to over 30 potential bidders who had previously expressed an interest in the company. These potential bidders had signed confidentiality agreements and were given a deadline of 10 March 1999 for submission of indicative offers.</P>
      <P>Five indicative bids were received by the deadline from NTL Group Ltd., TCI Tele-Communications Ireland Ltd., ESAT Telecom Group plc, United Pan-Europe Communications N.V. and Cable Management Ireland Ltd.</P>
      <P>Based on an evaluation of the proposals by the appointed advisers, Rothschilds, all five bidders proceeded to the next stage of the process which involved a detailed due diligence process and presentations from Cablelink management. Following consideration of further bids, received on 27 April 1999, it was decided that the NTL bid of £535,180,000 should be accepted.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance and Comsource conveyed their approval on 6 May, in accordance with section 3.1 of the Telecom Éireann shareholders' agreement and a sale and purchase agreement between the shareholders and NTL was signed that day. Telecom Éireann, RTE and NTL signed an agreement on 7 July 1999 formally handing over ownership of Cablelink to NTL.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the sale accrued to the shareholders, Telecom Éireann and RTE, in proportion to their shareholding.</P>

      <P>It is envisaged that the NEHB project for the site will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested in the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million. The proposal from the NEHB includes a gymnasium, an all-weather pitch and a swimming pool. I understand that these facilities would be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes. The arrangements regarding their use will be a matter to be agreed between the local community and the North Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>The Army Equitation School has a unique role. Established in 1926 with a mission to promote the Irish horse abroad through participation in international competitions, the school has since then not alone been an excellent showcase for Irish horses but its riders have represented Ireland with distinction throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy down the years had been to purchase for use by the equitation school only horses <Col N="650" /> which contained no foreign blood. This policy had over recent years become somewhat of an anachronism due to developments in the breeding industry which has seen increased numbers of foreign stallions breeding in Ireland. In order to widen the pool of potential showjumpers available to the school, and following consultation with the officer commanding the school and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I recently announced that the guidelines for the acquisition of horses for the school should be sufficiently broad so as to allow for the acquisition of horses that are by foreign stallions approved by the Irish Horse Board.</P>
    <P>This new policy will broaden the pool of potential showjumpers available for purchase by the equitation school while continuing to support the Irish horse breeder. It will improve the quality of the school's stock and its competitiveness which, in turn, will enhance the image of the Irish horse industry throughout the world. Out of 13 horses acquired by way of purchase or lease for the Army Equation School this year, three are Irish foaled and bred with foreign sires.</P>

      <P>Although a small number of cases exist where breaches of the rules by third parties have been identified, I am satisfied that my Department is properly applying EU animal transport laws.</P>
      <P>As regards breaches, a recently published report of the food and veterinary office of the commission on approved staging posts and long distance transport of animals in France included, <i>inter alia</i>, a reference to a small number of specific instances where people responsible for the transport of animals from Ireland did not appear to have strictly adhered to EU welfare rules. A number of matters raised in this report relate to the implementation of animal welfare rules on French territory, and these are a matter for discussion between the French authorities and the commission.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has been in touch with the commission in relation to this matter and has written to approved livestock hauliers to remind them of their obligation to adhere to rules in relation to the protection of animals during transport, and advising them that I will consider revoking the licences of hauliers found to have been in breach of these rules. I will continue to treat animal welfare as a matter of the highest priority and I can assure the Deputy that I remain fully committed to ensuring that EU rules in relation to animal transport are effectively enforced at all times.</P>

      <P>The position is that under the terms of an amendment to Ireland's agri-environment programme which provides for the conservation of natural heritage areas including commonages, sheep numbers on commonages may not be increased. In this context, individual detailed commonage framework plans for all commonages are in the process of being drawn up by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It is expected that the vast bulk of these commonage framework plans will be finalised and implemented during 2001-early 2002. When these plans are implemented, farmers with commonage land who wish to avail of the ewe premium scheme, suckler cow premium scheme or disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance will have to join the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; or a national scheme to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Individual argi-environment plans drawn up under REPS or the national scheme will have to take account of the destocking levels, if any, contained in the relevant commonage framework plan.</P>
      <P>Farmers with commonage land in the six western counties who were not participating in REPS were required, under the terms of a national interim commonage framework plan, to reduce ewe numbers by 30% in 1998. The farmers in question were compensated under a scheme operated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for loss of income arising from the reduction in stock numbers. No such reduction in stock numbers is currently being applied to farmers with commonage land outside of the six western counties and the question of compensation for destocking does not therefore arise. The farmers in question may however opt to join the new REPs scheme which will be open for applications from next week and under which compensation under measure A is available for conservation of natural heritage areas including commonages.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the introduction of an on-farm market valuation system under the TB and brucellosis schemes. Meetings have been taking place between officials of my Department and the farming organisations on the detailed arrangements for the introduction of the new system. However, given the complexity and broad range of the issues involved, it has not been possible to conclude these negotiations to date. The most recent meeting took place on 16 November 2000 and a further meeting is due shortly.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed on-farm valuation scheme, the objective is to introduce a system which provides fair compensation for herdowners whose herds are affected by TB or brucellosis so as to enable them to replace affected animals with equivalent stock. For purposes of valuations, &ldquo;market value&rdquo; will be the equivalent price which might reasonably have been obtained for the animal, at the time of determination of compensation, from a purchaser in the open market if the animal was not affected by TB or brucellosis or was not being removed as part of a depopulation under part of the disease eradication programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the on-farm valuation system must contribute towards reducing the incidence of the disease, should not be unduly expensive <Col N="660" /> and the conditions attaching to the system should be readily understood by all involved. Its operation will be monitored by a committee which will include representatives of the Department and farming organisations and will report on a regular basis to the animal health forum.</P>

      <P>In response to the recent flooding the Government decided to initiate an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve cases of severe hardship.

      <P>Application forms for the new early retirement scheme, with the terms and conditions under which the scheme will operate, will be available from the local offices of my Department from 29 November. Farmers who were unable to participate in the old scheme may submit an application under the new one. Any farmer applying under the scheme should read the conditions very carefully before submitting his or her application to ensure all of the conditions for eligibility under the scheme are satisfied. I can give no commitment as to the outcome of individual cases until such time as my Department is in a position to examine the applications. However, I hope farmers who were excluded from the old scheme in certain circumstances, such as those where legal documentation relating to transfers of lands was not complete when the old scheme closed to applications on 31 December 2000, will be able to satisfy the conditions necessary to qualify under the new scheme.</P>

      <P>Normally, the computer program to produce the annual notice of assessment is available in May-June each year. This year, however, there was a delay in issuing notices because the computer program to produce them for the 1999/2000 tax year was not fully operational until 11 September. The delay in having the computer program ready was due to the unprecedented demands on revenue's IT staff and resources arising from preparations for Y2K, the changeover to the euro, the introduction of the Revenue On-Line Service and continuing work on integrated taxation processing. The backlog of applications for notices of assessment for 1999-2000 has now been cleared.</P>
      <P>As regards future years, revenue will make every effort to have the computer program available to enable staff in the inspector of taxes offices to process tax returns and issue the notices of assessment without delay.</P>

      <P>The following income tax reliefs are currently available in respect of carers &ndash; relief for employed person taking care of incapacitated individual and relief for health expenses.</P>
      <P>Tax relief of up to £8,500 per annum is available where an individual employs a carer to look after an incapacitated relative. For the purposes of this relief, a relative includes a relation by marriage, and a person in respect of whom the individual is or was the legal guardian. Carers may be employed on an individual basis or through an agency. The relief is not due where the carer is employed as a housekeeper only. The relief is available at the individual's marginal rate of tax and can, of course, be claimed by PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> An individual may claim tax relief for certain medical expenses incurred for themselves and their immediate family, or on behalf of a dependent relative in respect of whom he or she is entitled to a dependent relative tax allowance. Where the dependent relatives allowance does not apply it may be possible to obtain tax relief for covenants to the elderly or the incapacitated. Medical expenses relief is available at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate in excess of £100 for a single person or £200 for a married couple or family in a tax year. Most non-routine medical and dental expenses, not already reimbursed or reimbursable by the VHI, BUPA or regional health authorities, including such items as the cost of doctors' visits, maintenance or treatment in a hospital and transport by ambulance, are allowable.</P>
    <P>Certain items prescribed by a doctor will also qualify for relief including, for example, engaging a qualified nurse in the case of a serious illness, physiotherapy or similar treatment, drugs and medicines, hearing aids, orthopaedic bed-chair, wheelchair-wheelchair lift &ndash; no relief is due for alteration to the building to facilitate a lift &ndash; and glucometer machine for a diabetic. Maintenance in an approved nursing home also qualifies for relief.</P>

    <P>The amount of MIR for non-first time buyers is £2,000 for single persons and £4,000 for married-widowed persons. MIR for first time buyers is £2,500 and £5,000, respectively. It is assumed that in increasing rent relief to the level of MIR the amount of rent relief for widowed persons would be increased to that of MIR for married couples, <Col N="670" /> contributing to costs of £0.2 million and £0.6 million respectively for those aged 55 years and over.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that the increases in rent relief mentioned in the questions apply to rent relief allowable to single persons with <i>pro rata</i> increases intended for married and widowed tenants. Rent relief for widowed persons is currently set at 150% of the amount of rent relief for single persons in the relevant age category, while rent relief for married couples is double that for single persons. A cost figure for tenants aged 55 years and over is also included for the proposed increase to £3,000 because it would set the relief at a higher level than is currently available to this group. In the case of increases to £2,000 and £1,500, no one category of claimant under 55 years, single, widowed or married would have a higher amount of relief than their equivalent in the 55 years and over group.</P>
    <P>These figures are provisional and subject to revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>Stimulant drinks contain three active ingredients, caffeine, glucuronolactone and taurine. In 1999 the European Scientific Committee for Food &ndash; SCF &ndash; was asked by the European Commission for an opinion on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks. This committee, which carries out risk assessment on foodstuffs in Europe, reached a number of conclusions in its opinion. These were based on an assumed maximum intake level of 0.5 litre of energy drink per day. It concluded that the contribution of energy drinks to overall caffeine intake is not a matter of concern for non-pregnant adults &ndash; moderation of caffeine intake, from whatever source, is advisable during pregnancy; substitution of energy drinks for normal beverages by children could lead to increased caffeine levels in this group &ndash; this could result in transient behavioural changes such as arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety; the interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, nor has the interaction of caffeine and taurine with alcohol particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating; and the safety in use of taurine and glucuronolactone as delivered in energy drinks has not been established. Further studies would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This opinion makes it clear that the scientific data were not available to answer all questions about the safety of these energy drinks under all circumstances of usage. I have therefore requested the Food Safety Promotion Board &ndash; FSPB &ndash; one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, to commission independent, scien<Col N="672" /> tific research into the effects of these stimulant energy drinks.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that energy drinks are on sale throughout the country, it is important that their safety is evaluated on a national level. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, which is responsible for the enforcement of food safety law in Ireland, is not aware of any proven links between the consumption of energy drinks and adverse health conditions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the scientific research on these energy drinks from the Food and Safety Promotion Board in due course.</P>

      <P>Talks have been taking place with the professional bodies representing 13 professions with a view to agreeing a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals since April 2000. The professions included in the current talks are physiotherapists, social workers, radiographers, psychologists, chiropodists-podiatrists, care workers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, environmental health officers, biochemists, orthoptists and medical laboratory technicians.</P>
      <P>My Department produced a consultative document which formed the basis of a series of workshops, where the professional bodies have been given an opportunity to debate fully the issues involved. As a result of the workshops the consultative document has been comprehensively revised. The professional bodies are currently debating this document among their membership and will be providing feedback to my Department in the coming weeks. Subject to the professional bodies' agreement to the proposals, my Department will commence drafting the heads of a Bill in the near future.</P>
      <P>Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents including the report of the review group on the ambulance service and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service considerable progress has been made in the area of training for emergency medical technicians and the Government is now taking steps to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy in relation to advanced training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which I recently established, will provide a firm <Col N="673" /> basis for the future development of professional standards in the ambulance service and pre-hospital care generally. One of the first tasks the council will be asked to address are the issues surrounding the development of advanced emergency medical technician training, including the regulatory issues which arise in relation to this. I expect the council to deal comprehensively with all issues in its consideration of advanced training and to provide a detailed implementation plan in the near future.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes.  The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical card holders. While the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice of gluten free foods, my Department is currently reviewing the list of gluten free products with a view to making some additional products available under the common reimbursable list.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. In view of this special provision, disablement benefit is not regarded as excluded income in assessing a person's means for a medical card.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The form E111 provides entitlement to immediate necessary medical treatment during a temporary stay in an EU or EEA member state on the same basis as if the person was an insured resident of that member state. It is important to note that in some instances accessing these services may incur a charge, however, such charges would be in line with charges imposed on residents of that country. Temporary stays are periods where a person cannot be considered resident in a member state under that country's legislation. The E111 is available from health boards and all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to obtain this form. This covers public treatment only and any person who opts for private treatment is liable for any expenses incurred. It is important to remember that the E111 may not cover all one's medical expenses.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware Lanzarote is one of the Canary Islands which are ruled by the Spanish Constitution and by the norms of the European Union. Visitors will need to contact the local INSS, INSALUD or Autonomous Communities Office to obtain the address of the Ambultorio Health Centre, Consultorio or doctor. The visitor should supply a photocopy of form E111 for the Ambultorio Health Centre, the Consultario, or doctor to retain. The original E111 must also be shown but will be returned to the patient. A copy of form E111 is required every time that treatment is received.</P>
      <P>It is also essential that the visitor seeks treatment from a doctor who treats health service patients, at a time reserved for health service patients. The national health service in Spain also provides emergency care 24 hours a day on an out-patient basis or at the place of residence of the patient, which is free of charge provided the above procedure is followed.</P>
      <P>Any visitor who does not follow these procedures will be charged for private medical treatment. The Spanish State health scheme does not in general allow for the refund of the cost of private medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary before travelling to have form E111 stamped by the appropriate health board. Information regarding the health services available in the country of destination can be obtained from the person's local community care office. In addition the E111 form provides instructions on <Col N="679" /> its use and a list of countries where it is of relevance. Neither my Department nor the health boards collect information regarding areas most commonly visited by Irish tourists to which the E111 form is of no relevance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy relating to medical card coverage in the North Eastern Health Board are as follows: 1997 covering 121,069 persons; 1998 covering 120,247; 1999 covering 112,673; 2000* covering 107,570.</P>
      <P>*This represents figures at end of June 2000.</P>
      <P>The number of eligible persons covered by the medical cards in the North Eastern Health Board area between the end of year 1999 and the end of June 2000 has dropped by 5,103, which is a reduction of 4.74%. The corresponding overall percentage reduction for the whole country for that period is 1.48%.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that, under legislation, medical cards are issued by the chief executive officer of a relevant health board having regard to the general criteria referred to in the relevant legislation which states that chief executive officers should issue medical cards, where in their opinion, the person concerned is unable without undue hardship to arrange general medical services for himself or herself and their dependents.</P>
      <P>In the case of the NEHB, the change in medical card coverage in 2000 had not been specifically brought to my attention. But I should point out that there are always bound to be regional fluctuations in medical card coverage influenced by localised economic and other factors which can vary between regions over time.</P>
      <P>I have now been informed by the NEHB that factors, including income, failure to submit necessary information, movements in the region and death have affected the particular figures for the current year.</P>

      <P>The blind welfare allowance is a supplementary payment that comes under the aegis of my Department and forms part of special services for blind persons under the Blind Persons Act, 1920. Guidelines referring to this allowance were issued to the health boards in 1979. These guidelines stated that persons not maintained in an institution who are in receipt of the maximum blind pension or the social welfare contributory old age pension may be regarded as eligible for the blind welfare allowance at the maximum rate subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>I understand that health boards take a flexible approach in this regard and pay the allowance using the following criteria: the applicant must be in receipt of a Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs payment, that is, disability allowance, invalidity pension, a blind pension or an old age pension; they must undergo medical assessment for their visual impairment, be able to supply a certificate of visual impairment or be registered with the National Council for the Blind; they must not be maintained in an institution; they must be unemployed.</P>
      <P>Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>
      <P>The rates of payment depend on the claimant's family circumstances as follows: (a) supplementary allowance payable in addition to a blind pension: blind pensioner over 18 £24.00 per week; blind couple £48.00 per week; increase for child dependant £3.40 per week; (b) supplementary allowance payable in addition to disability allowance to blind persons over 16 years and under 18 years in respect of: an adult dependant £ 2.85 per week; a child dependant £3.00 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> The rates are increased each year in line with annual increases in social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. This is one of a series of reviews which are being undertaken by various Departments in line with a Government decision. The review of the nursing home subvention scheme is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of funding allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme has been significantly increased by this Government and reached £38.5 million in 2000. Over £5 million in additional funding was allocated in 2000 to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving <Col N="689" /> the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby health boards no longer take account of the ability of adult sons and/or daughters to contribute towards the cost of their parents' care. A further £4 million is included in the Estimates for 2001 to meet increasing demands on the scheme. The question of increasing rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding, other competing priorities and the results of the expenditure review.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which savings are assessed for medical card eligibility purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26752/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are granted to those who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board are unable to provide, without undue hardship, medical and surgical services for themselves or their dependants. The hardship referred to here is financial hardship, which may result from medical hardship, that is, high medical expenses.</P>
      <P>Any investments or savings that could or should generate an income are taken into account in assessing income for medical card purposes. Interest from savings is taken into account but after that it is general practice to disallow a modest amount of savings when assessing the amount of savings/assets which could be redeemed as an income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application is dealt with on its merits. The health board chief executive officers operate an independent appeals process for those who consider that they have been unfairly assessed. Such persons can also bring their case to the attention of the Ombudsman. It should also be noted that where a family would not qualify for a medical card, an individual member of a family may qualify, that is, if the family member's medical <Col N="690" /> expenses were such as to jeopardise the income of the whole family.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields surrounding power lines. The general body of scientific evidence has not conclusively established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, while it has not been possible to determine a definite link neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship. For this reason it is, in my view, extremely prudent that we should take all new research reports very seriously and continue to carefully examine them. Medical officers in my Department keep informed of any significant developments in this area. I am advised that all new research findings are incorporated into the existing body of scientific literature and are assessed by the broad scientific community. Research in this area is ongoing involving the World Health Organisation and at EU level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that arrangements are in place for supply of incontinence pads to medical card holders whether they are living in the community or cared for in a private nursing home. Arrangements for the supply of incontinence pads to medical card patients living in the community are a matter for the relevant health board. However, under Article 16 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, patients cared for in private nursing homes who are subvented by a health board should receive incontinence pads from the nursing home. If a medical card holder is being cared for in a private nursing home but is not being subvented by a health board, it would be a matter for the health board to supply incontinence pads as required.</P>

    <P>The scheme was 14th on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the <Col N="694" /> scheme by the council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>National Car Testing Service Limited, NCTS, commenced operations on 4 January 2000. Test centres are situated so that at least 90% of car owners are within 30 miles of one of the 43 test centres. A total of 267,938 initial tests had been carried out by close of business on 16 November 2000. A total of 128,507 cars passed first time. Overall, 251,495 have passed the test including those who have passed on retest.</P>
      <P>NCTS is required to provide and operate a comprehensive complaints procedure as part of its quality customer service obligations. This procedure includes provision for an appeal against the results of a test. A notice drawing attention to the complaints procedure is displayed in each test centre. It is also open to an owner, who is aggrieved by the outcome of a test, to appeal to the District Court. The court may either refuse the appeal or direct a new test. To date, 702 complaints have been made and so far 691 have been resolved.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements are appropriately designed to safeguard both the interests of owners and the integrity of the national car test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Census 91, Volume 10, Housing, published by the CSO in 1997, shows that 50,447 households are supplied by privately sourced group water schemes. A further 129,098 households are dependent on private individual water supply systems.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan 2000-2006, a record £420 million is being provided to finance a range of measures to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water supplies, including: 100% capital grants for essential water disinfection and treatment equipment for privately sourced group schemes; 85% grants for new and upgraded group water schemes, subject to a cost limit of £6,000 per house; an annual subsidy of up to £155 per house towards the operational cost of group water schemes; grants of up to £1,600 per house for the provision or improvement of an individual water supply; an increase in the cost threshold for small public water and sewerage schemes from £250,000 to £500,000; and a new national source monitoring programme to determine the quality of sources used by private group water schemes.</P>
      <P>In the case of group water schemes serving more than 50 persons, national drinking water regulations require the persons responsible to ensure that the quality of the supplies are in compliance with EU drinking water directive standards not later than the end of 2003. Improvement works necessary to bring about compliance in these cases, and in the case of groups serving less than 50 persons, will generally be grant aidable under the new provisions outlined above. On a broader level, county councils are at present compiling strategic rural water plans which will determine the approach to providing quality water supplies to rural areas on the basis of sound economic and engineering principles and optimum usage of existing public and group scheme infrastructure. These plans, combined with the funding set out under the national development plan, will provide for a robust rural water investment strategy aimed at remedying current deficiencies in rural water supply systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to contamination of sources, I am satisfied that adequate penalty and other enforcement provisions for the protection of water qual<Col N="697" /> ity are in place under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related environmental legislation, including provisions to prevent pollution and to require the effects of pollution to be remedied. I will nevertheless be reviewing these provisions in the context of proposals being developed in my Department for further legislation in relation to water services and water quality.</P>

Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession continues to 25 July 2002, subject to a minimum tenancy period of five years, even where this may extend beyond that date.</P>

      <P>Under the devolved rural water programme, it is a matter for local authorities to finance approved projects out of the annual block capital grant allocated by my Department. Earlier this year a comprehensive range of measures was introduced to assist the group water scheme sector, including grants of up to 85% of the cost of developing new schemes, subject to a maximum cost limit of £6,000 per house, together with a 100% grant for essential water disinfection and treatment equipment. While Kilkenny County Council has requested a special grant for the Castlewarren scheme, no funds are available to assist groups outside of the normal grants structure.</P>
      <P>In the case of group schemes with exceptionally high costs that cannot be accommodated within the grants structure, the local authority should review the design approach with a view to achieving economies or, alternatively, have elements such as the headworks or trunk mains developed by way of a small public scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>The compensation code for compulsory purchase of land, including land required for road development, provides for the payment of compensation by local authorities for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO. The amount of compensation payable is a matter for negotiation between the landowner and the local authority concerned, or in the event of dispute, for arbitration. The basic rule applied by the property arbitrator under the relevant legislation is the market value of the land. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and injurious affection. I have no plans to change this system.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that, in principle, it is desirable for statutory procedures, including land acquisition, to be completed as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the transfer of the Minister's functions to An Bord Pleanála and brings about other changes designed to streamline the compulsory purchase order process. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries, the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities themselves where there are no objections, time limits on submitting compulsory purchase orders to the board for confirmation, an 18 week objective for making decisions on compulsory purchase orders and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months. These changes are expected to result in a more effective, streamlined CPO system and should lead to earlier completion of procedures in this area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the national development plan and the national roads programme the National Roads Authority is pursuing a broad-ranging package of measures to speed up project delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions No. 308 and 348 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme was £44 million in 1999. This year a sum of £46.3 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme and £46.6 million has been provided for 2001. To double the allowance in all cases would cost £46.6 million in 2001. To double the standard allowance from £5 per week to £10 per week would cost an extra £37.25 million per fuel sea<Col N="702" /> son. Based on current payment rates it would cost £1.79 million to extend the fuel season by one week in 2001 or £46.6 million to extend the scheme to the full year.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>In that regard, substantial increases were made in all the social welfare primary payments of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    <P>I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. Although the national fuel scheme operated for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of year. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.      </P>

      <P>Adult dependants are catered for in the social welfare system through the payment of qualified adult allowances where a spouse or partner is in receipt of a social welfare payment. Until recently the qualified adult allowance was payable at approximately 60% of the personal rate. This was in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, 1986, and reflects the economies of scale which are considered to exist where two people are living together. This is the traditional way in which couples have been provided for under the social welfare system, not just in Ireland but in many other countries.</P>
      <P>However, more recent research undertaken by the ESRI for the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes report published in August 1999, suggested that the QAA should be increased to 70% of the personal rate.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to reaching this recommended level for the QAA over three budgets. The process was started in budget 2000 when increases in QAAs payable with pensions ranged from 8% to 17%. These increases brought the QAA to a level of between 60.5% and 67% of the personal rate.</P>
      <P>Further progress will be made in the forthcoming budget, the extent of which will depend on the resources available and the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>People participating on community employment schemes already retain entitlement to fuel allowance and to the Christmas bonus, subject to the same conditions that apply to participants in other employment schemes. One of these conditions is that gross household income must not exceed £250 per week.</P>
      <P>To qualify for fuel allowance, a person must be in receipt of one of a number of qualifying payments or be on an employment programme such as community employment, CE, and must satisfy certain other conditions. They must live alone or only with a dependent spouse/partner and/or a dependent child or children, or with a person who is in receipt of a qualifying payment and thus eligible for the fuel allowance in their own right, or with a person giving them full-time care or with a person getting short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who was in receipt of a fuel allowance before going on to a CE scheme will retain their entitlement as long as they meet the con<Col N="704" /> ditions set out above and have a gross household income of less than £250 per week.</P>
    <P>A Christmas bonus is paid to long-term recipients of social welfare to help meet the extra expense incurred at Christmas. This year the bonus has been increased from 70% to 100% of the  recipient's normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20. A person on a CE scheme who retains their secondary benefits would therefore continue to qualify for the Christmas bonus.</P>

      <P>Persons who pay or have paid social insurance contributions at classes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, N or S are covered for bereavement grant. Contributions paid at PRSI class K consist of a health contribution only and do not include any social insurance element. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extend entitlement to a bereavement grant to persons who have class K contributions only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, persons making class K contributions will normally have either paid contributions at one of the other relevant PRSI classes during the course of their working lives or their spouses will have paid such contributions. In this regard, it should be noted that entitlement to payment of a bereavement grant can be based on the social insurance record of a spouse. Payment of a bereavement grant will be made once the required qualifying conditions are fulfilled. In this regard, a broad range of options are available. A bereavement grant is payable: (a) on the death of a person who has been getting a contributory pension or on the death of his/her spouse or qualified dependants; or (b) on the death of a person who has been getting orphan's contributory allowance or on the death of his/her guardian; or (c) if the person on whose social welfare record the claim is being made has at least 156 weeks PRSI paid since entry into insurable employment; or (d) if the person on whose social insurance record the claim is being made has at least 26 weeks PRSI paid since entry into insurable employment; and either (i) 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year; or (ii) a yearly average of 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited over the three or five tax years before the death occurred or pension age was reached (age 66 at present); or (iii) a yearly average of 26 PRSI contributions paid or credited since 1979 (or since starting work if later) and the end of the tax year before the death occurred or <Col N="706" /> pension age was reached; or (iv) a yearly average of 26 PRSI contributions paid or credited since 1 October 1970 (or since starting work if later) and the end of the tax year before the death occurred or pension age was reached.</P>
    <P>The relevant tax year is the last complete tax year before the year in which the death occurs or pension age was reached. A claim should be made within 12 months of the date of death. Once the qualifying conditions are satisfied, a bereavement grant is payable to the spouse, personal representative or next of kin of the deceased person.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million was again provided for the scheme in 2000.</P>
      <P>The total amount of funding paid or approved for payment to voluntary organisations seeking assistance under the scheme on behalf of vulnerable elderly people this year is £2,607,105. This figure does not however represent the total funding sought under the 2000 scheme as applications are still being processed by the various regional offices of my Department. Definitive statistics for the scheme will be compiled once all applications received this year have been processed. As is usual in my Department, this information will be made available to the Oireachtas Library early in 2001.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to old age non-contributory pension is subject to a means test. Items which count as means include cash income, the value of any property, excluding the person's own home, and the value of any investments and capital which a person may have. Means-tested payments are subject to periodic review and there is also an obligation on recipients to inform my Department of any change in means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a means review warrants an increase in the rate of pension in payment, the resulting <Col N="708" /> deciding officer decision is notified to the person by letter. The person is also given advice of his/her right of appeal, if the rate of payment is less than the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>When a means review gives rise to a potential reduction in the rate of payment, the deciding officer writes to the person concerned before a formal decision is made. This letter identifies the various means sources, sets out the manner in which the means are calculated and informs the pensioner regarding the extent of the proposed rate reduction. The pensioner is also afforded an opportunity to furnish any statement or evidence which they would wish to be taken into account in the formal decision. The pensioner is requested to respond within 21 days.</P>
    <P>The response, if any, is taken into account by the deciding officer and may result in some instances in further investigation before a decision is made. A letter is sent then to the pensioner notifying him/her of the deciding officer decision. This again identifies the various means sources, outlines how the means were calculated and informs the pensioner of the resulting reduction in the pension rate. If the person concerned is in receipt of payment by means of a pension book, the pensioner is requested to return the pension book in order that a new book can be issued at the correct reduced rate.</P>
    <P>In addition the pensioner is afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office within 21 days, if dissatisfied with the decision. The person is advised to set out clearly the grounds of appeal in a letter. He/she is also advised to contact the relevant deciding officer if further clarification regarding the decision is required.</P>
    <P>On receipt of an appeal in the social welfare appeals office, the deciding officer is normally requested by that office to submit a statement showing the extent to which the facts and contentions advanced by the appellant are admitted or disputed, together with any documentation that is relevant to the appeal. In the course of this process, it is also open to the deciding officer to consider a revision of the decision in the light of any new facts or evidence which have emerged.</P>
    <P>If the appeals officer is of the opinion that the case can be decided without the necessity of an oral hearing, the appeal may be decided summarily. If the appeals officer is of the opinion that an oral hearing is required, the pensioner and relevant other persons will be invited to attend. Following the appeal officer's decision on the case, a letter is issued by the social welfare appeals office to the appellant stating the outcome. The deciding officer is also notified and any consequent administrative action required is then carried out to give effect to the appeals officer's decision.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1. In the case of contributory benefits and pensions, including living alone allowances and over 80 allowances payable with these pensions, the cost of any increases in payment rates is borne by the social insurance fund. In the case of all other payments the cost is borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>2. Maternity/adoptive benefit payment is calculated as a percentage of the claimants reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant tax year. A £1 increase in the upper limit would not necessarily mean an increase in payment for all claimants.</P>
    <P>3. As there are only an average of 28 health and safety benefit recipients, a £1 per week increase would have a negligible cost.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was interviewed on 13 July 2000 in connection with her application for one parent family payment and was requested to supply a P45 statement from her last employer, a statement of mortgage from her local authority and information relating to a bank loan, in order to determine her means situation. Reminders were issued to her in August and again in September. She was also requested to provide documentary evidence of her efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse, who is in employment. In this regard maintenance summons can be issued by a District Court clerk at no cost to her.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned did not provide the necessary documentation, her claim for one parent family payment was disallowed on 29 September 2000. She was informed in writing of this decision and of her right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. She has not been in contact with the Department since then and has not submitted the requested documentation. If the information in question is now furnished, her case will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time firefighters are entitled to an unemployment payment in respect of days in which they are engaged in fire-fighting or training. They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of an unemployment payment, that is, they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work and, in this <Col N="712" /> respect, deciding officers do not treat them differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are issued to all deciding officers in order to ensure a consistent and uniform application of the rules governing the deciding of unemployment benefit and assistance claims. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for and genuinely seeking suitable, full-time employment is not entitled to an unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Department officials have been in contact with the association representing part-time firefighters to discuss matters in relation to entitlement to unemployment payments and a further meeting is due to take place later this month.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy would like to contact me about a particular case I would be glad to have it examined.</P>

      <Quest>the level of contributory and non-contributory old age pension necessary to attain the target of 34% of average industrial earnings requested by the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament for budget 2001.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent data published by the Central Statistics Office shows that average industrial earnings were £333.23 per week as at December 1999. Pension rates of 34% of average industrial earnings would accordingly be around £113.30 per week.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the report of the national pensions policy initiative, published by the Pensions Board in 1999, recommended that a target rate of 34% of average industrial earnings should form a backdrop to the achievement of the Government's £100 per week target for the maximum personal rate of contributory old age pensions in 2002. The board considered that the target should be achieved within a five to ten year period. With regard to the appropriate rate for non-contributory pensions, for example, the old age and widow/er's non-contributory pensions, the board concurred with the Commission on Social Welfare's earlier view that a 10% differential between social insurance and social assistance payments should be maintained.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to advancing the goal of bringing the old age contributory pension up to £100 per week in the forthcoming budget and to extending the £100 commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. I am currently giving consideration to the pre-budget submission of the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament in the context of budgetary measures for pensioners.</P>

      <P>The carer's benefit scheme came into operation on 26 October this year. As at 16 November, a total of 60 claims for the benefit have been received and there were 11 persons in receipt of a payment. Some 15 claims have been refused and a further 34 applications are currently being processed or have been approved for payment at a future date. In this regard, claimants are advised to apply for carer's benefit prior to leaving employment to take up full time caring duties. Expenditure on the scheme in 2000 will be in the region of £50,000.</P>
      <P>As increases, if any, in the rate of payment applicable to carer's benefit will be announced as part of budget 2001 it is not possible to estimate the cost of such increases in a full year or in respect of any period in 2001. It should be noted that the Government is committed to completing the process of bringing forward the dates of social welfare budget increases to coincide with the beginning of the tax year. Increases in weekly rates will therefore apply from early April in 2001. In addition, the Government has already announced that increases in the weekly rates of payments in 2002 will be further brought forward to early January 2002 so as to coincide with the beginning of the 2002 tax year following the alignment of the tax and calendar years with effect from that year.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 333, 340 and 346 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in its Action Programme for the Millennium, and arising from the review of the carer's allowance which was published by my Department in October 1998, I introduced major improvements to the carer's allowance scheme in the 1999 and 2000 budgets.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. At the end of October 2000, there were 16,176 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures indicate that 32 per cent of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant and in budget 2000 I made provision to increase this grant from £200 to £300. This grant is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance to use in whatever way they choose. It is estimated that to increase the grant by £100 would cost an additional £1.6 million based on the current number of 16,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. There has been very positive feedback on this payment and I will keep its operation under review.</P>
      <P>The review also examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It is similar to the requests for a cost of disability payment which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended should be introduced by the Department of Health and Children. However, the estimated cost of introducing a monthly universal cost of care allowance of £100 would be in the region of £60 million based on the current number of carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessable is applied <Col N="715" /> to the carer's allowance to ensure that resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes mean that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost of increasing the earnings disregards is not available at this time. I am arranging for the information to be supplied to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the means test will be kept under review.</P>

The increases in social welfare weekly payments are due to be paid in April 2001 and assuming any increase in child dependant allowances would be paid from the same date, the cost for each £1 increase would be approximately £15 million in 2001.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions No. 335 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>Total social welfare expenditure for the years 1995 to 2000 and the percentage relationship with GNP and GDP in each of the years in question is set out in the table below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the estimated percentage relationship between social welfare expenditure and GDP for 2000, that is 6.7% were to be maintained in 2001, <Col N="716" /> total social welfare expenditure would be in the region of £5.980 billion.</P>
    <P>However, as GDP includes repatriated profits from overseas companies operating in Ireland, GNP is generally recognised as the more representative indicator of changes in economic activity. Accordingly, if the estimated percentage relationship between social welfare expenditure and GNP for 2000, that is, 7.9%, were to be maintained in 2001, total social welfare expenditure would be in the region of £5.874 billion.</P>
    <P>While the recently published Estimates provide for total social welfare expenditure of £5.568 billion for the year 2001, it should be noted that this figure represents the pre-budget allocation and does not take account of the increases in social welfare for 2001 to be announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget in early December.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that, since entitlement to social welfare payments is based on a range of contingencies such as old age, unemployment, birth of children, etc., the overall amount paid in any year is not related to the overall size of GNP or GDP. The significant reduction in unemployment coupled with the still relatively low proportion of older people have served to contain the growth in social welfare expenditure despite substantial payment rate increases at a time when GDP-GNP is growing at record levels.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the expected rate of inflation for 2001 will only be announced by the Minister for Finance in the December budget, it is not possible at this stage to give an estimation of total social welfare expenditure for 2001 increased in line with inflation.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group is being established which will have a <Col N="717" /> mandate to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. This will include its long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will also take account of work being carried out to review the underlying methodology of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>A chairperson for the group has now been appointed and the social partners and relevant Departments have been invited to formally nominate their representatives to the group.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will have two representatives on the group whose expertise in the area of social welfare policy will provide a significant input to the group's deliberations.</P>

      <P>The main source of information of a comprehensive nature on social welfare entitlements is the Guide to Social Welfare Services which is a comprehensive booklet giving a broad outline of all social welfare services. It is supported by a further range of individual leaflets and booklets giving more detailed information on each of the schemes and services available.</P>
      <P>These are widely available through my Department's network of over 130 local and branch offices, and through other outlets such as the Citizens' Information Centres operating under the auspices of Comhairle. Information staff in all of these offices are available to inform, advise and assist customers in relation to their entitlements.</P>
      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. It remains a priority within my Department to ensure that people are made aware of their rights and advised and assisted when the need arises to avail of benefits or allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>All developments and improvements in social welfare services are widely advertised using an appropriate mix of media at local and national level. Selective use is also made of freephone services to provide information on the introduction of new schemes or, for example, at budget time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Department's experience that information is of most benefit when it is targeted at particular groups and addresses the specific needs of such groups. In this regard, over the past year, my Department has issued customised infor<Col N="718" /> mation booklets to over 550,000 people in receipt of payments including pensions, carer's allowance, disability allowance, invalidity pensions and one-parent family payments. Prior to that, arrangements were also made to provide all people in receipt of unemployment payments with detailed information on the range of work, training and education options available.</P>
    <P>This process of direct information mailshots to customers will continue next year and will include detailed information on changes arising from the forthcoming budget. I am well aware of the important role of public representatives in relation to the provision of information, advice and assistance on social services generally and my Department will ensure that they are kept informed of changes and developments as they arise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 339 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over. The other free schemes, including the electricity-gas allowance, telephone rental allowance and television licence schemes, are generally available to those aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October 2000 all people aged 75 years and over are entitled to the free schemes regardless of income or household composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average annual value of the electricity allowance, telephone rental allowance and TV licence amounts to £412.37 annually per recipient, based on the direct cost to my Department. The cost of the free travel scheme is based on an annual notional figure of £60 per free travel pass. Higher usage may confer a significantly higher benefit to the recipient. Therefore, a person in receipt of all free schemes benefits by an esti<Col N="719" /> mated additional £472 per annum or £9 per week. These amounts apply to all recipients of the free schemes including those recipients who are over 75 years of age.</P>
    <P>The electricity-gas and telephone rental allowances are based on residency and are credited directly to the person's account by the ESB, Bord Gais and Eircom. All account set-ups and cross-organisational checks are done using the pensioner's utility account number.</P>
    <P>A pensioner who is entitled to an electricity-gas and telephone allowance must ensure that the electricity-gas meter and phone is in his/her own name to enable the ESB-Bord Gais and Eircom to credit the allowance to their account. If the pensioner lives in the home of another person, he/she will qualify for the allowance provided the electricity/gas and telephone account of the residence in question is in the pensioner's name.</P>
    <P>If the pensioner is not the registered consumer of electricity/gas for their home he or she should arrange with the local ESB-Gas office to become the registered account holder before making application for the allowance.</P>
    <P>If, at the time of application for the telephone allowance, the applicant does not have a telephone, or is not the registered account holder for the telephone in their home, he/she should contact the nearest Eircom office and arrange for either a new telephone installation to be provided or to become the registered telephone account holder for an existing telephone, as applicable.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. The surveys carried out as part of the research for the review of the free schemes highlighted the value that recipients placed on the benefit in kind approach of the free schemes. It was considered that the payment of the benefit directly to the service provider was one of the major advantages. This ensures that there is no time lag or administrative delay in receiving the benefit.</P>

      <P>There are no special provisions under the PRSI system in relation to women engaged in agriculture or women generally. The existing provisions apply equally to all categories of self-employed traders whose spouses work or assist in the family business.</P>
      <P>The PRSI status of women engaged in farming was considered by the advisory committee on the role of women in agriculture, which was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My Department was represented on this committee. Its report, published in September 2000, recommended that action be taken now to ensure that both farming spouses have the option of gaining individual access to PRSI entitlements. Given the complexity of the issues, the committee recommended that a working group with legal, financial and technical expertise be established to further consider the development of models which will afford women engaged in farming financial recognition for their input into farming. It is also recommended that the working group should comprise representatives of relevant Government Departments, including my Department, the social partners and women from the farming sector.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the technical group is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I understand that this matter will be progressed in the near future. Detailed consideration will be given to the findings when these become available. In addition, it will be necessary to consider any proposed changes to the existing arrangements for farm spouses in the wider context of the existing PRSI arrangements for other spouses who participate in non-farming family businesses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 345 together.</P>
      <P>In August I launched a report on phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which was undertaken by my Department. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the proposals in the review, improvements were introduced in budget 2000 in relation to two of the recommendations, that is further recognition of pre-1953 contributions and rationalising the old age contributory and retirement pensions rate band structure. Some 38,000 pensioners saw their position improved as a result of the latter and, to date, almost 2,600 new pensions have been awarded as a result of the further recognition now being afforded to pre-1953 contributions.</P>
      <P>Other proposals in the report include replacing the current average contributions test with one which will involve an assessment based on the total number of contributions paid or credited over a person's working life. These will be examined in detail in the second phase of the review which will commence in the next few months.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension &ndash; OACP &ndash; becomes payable at age 66 while retirement pension &ndash; RP &ndash; is payable to those who retire at age 65. Allowing those who have worked in insurable employment for 40 years to qualify for RP would in many cases reduce the qualifying age for pension significantly and would have significant cost implications. Issues in relation to qualification conditions will be examined further in phase 2 of the review.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the full-year cost of doubling the monthly rate of child benefit for each qualifying child would amount to £571 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value placed on the child benefit scheme by the Government is reflected in the level of resources invested in the scheme over the past number of years. The 1999 budget provided for a <Col N="722" /> full-year investment of over £40 million, while the most recent budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing total investment in the scheme up to £575 million annually. Some 491,000 families with a total of 967,000 children benefited from these increases. </P>
    <P>Additionally, the Government has made a commitment to substantially increase the child benefit payment over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. From September last, the basic child benefit monthly rates were increased to £42.50 per month in respect of each of the first two children and £56 per month in respect of the third and subsequent children in line with this commitment.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the child benefit scheme will continue to be strengthened as a key instrument in tackling child poverty and targeting resources at those families most in financial need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 350 and 351 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, my Department does not directly <Col N="723" /> provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is undoubtedly aware that earlier this month I launched my strategy under the national development plan for the continued conservation and protection, in the period up to 2006, of the sizeable portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties in the care of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department. Having conducted a detailed review of the properties under my control I have identified in excess of 100 sites which will require major work from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view during the above period. To this end, I have agreed to provide funding of in excess of £65 million to allow this essential work to be undertaken over the next six years. In view of the supports available to the owners of private properties, I cannot accept that this element of the national development plan discriminates against them.</P>
    <P>While it is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to control all heritage properties, I am conscious of the need to support the protection of the heritage not in State care. The national heritage plan, which will be published next year, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership. This will include the use of the Planning and Development Acts, the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage and increased levels of training in skills and craft <Col N="724" /> areas, which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that the issue of a group of juveniles who are actively engaging in criminal and anti-social activities was discussed at a recent meeting of the community policing forum at Store Street Garda Station. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there are seven juveniles, six of whom are from the area referred to by the Deputy, who are active in such activities.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the juveniles concerned have been charged a total of 114 times this year. These seven juveniles are the most persistent and active juvenile offenders in the area. The area referred to by the Deputy has been previously targeted by the Garda for public order operations and is also an integral part of the current Operation Oíche initiative.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the offenders to whom the Deputy refers are under the age of 16 years, the Minister for Education and Science is pursuing a five year development plan in the young offender area, involving the total expenditure of £25 million. His plan envisages major refurbishment of some of the existing custodial facilities, coupled with measures aimed at ensuring that the custodial facilities operated by his Department are capable of meeting their obligations upon the enactment of the Children Bill, 1999. Details of the measures which I am currently taking to ensure an adequate number of detention places for young offenders within my own Department's area of responsibility are set out in my reply to Question No. 130 of 5 October 2000.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to asylum seekers as opposed to immigrants. Asylum seekers entering the country at the present time have their needs met under the system of direct provision currently in operation. Direct provision for the most part represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers are also entitled to a range of other services while waiting to have their applications processed. For example, subject to satisfying means tests, asylum seekers are entitled to allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and medical cards. They are entitled to the same health services as Irish medical card holders and the children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of direct provision on 10 <Col N="729" /> April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom which introduced direct provision on 1 April last, and followed thorough investigation and careful planning. I believe the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers. While the operation of the scheme is being monitored on an ongoing basis, I have no plans, at present, to introduce alternative arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that my Department will conduct a review, in 2001, of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners. This commitment is in accordance with section 28 of the Act, which provides for a review of the operation of the Act within not less than two years and not more than three years of its commencement on 3 December 1998. This review, which will be carried out during 2001, will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of its operation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Parental Leave Act provides an entitlement to limited <i>force majeure</i> leave for urgent family reasons where, owing to injury to or illness of a family member, the presence of the employee, at the place where the family member is, is indispensable. The question of extending the entitlement to <i>force majeure</i> leave will be considered during the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>

However, the group did feel that a more appropriate development at this juncture would be full discussions, at reasonable intervals, between the steering group and these representative groups and the establishment of local liaison systems at individual prison level. The governors of Mountjoy Prison, Cloverhill Prison, St. Patrick's Institution and the training unit have agreed to establish local liaison groups with relevant community interests to facilitate dialogue and throughcare for persons treated in prison for drug dependency and with a view to enhancing the partnership approach to this issue.</P>

      <P>The findings referred to have not been brought to my attention, however, I have asked the director of the Prisons Medical Services to endeavour to obtain a copy of these findings. The contents of this report will then be given due consideration.</P>
      <P>On the issue of drug addiction I would like to lay out the numerous steps that I have put in place to try and combat this problem among the prison population. For example all committals to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's who misuse drugs are offered a 14 day detoxification programme; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who misuse drugs are offered a 21 day detoxification programme, or less depending on their remand period; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed continue their programmes while in custody there; ongoing addiction counselling and education programmes; community based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; an information forum is provided by the education-welfare services to prisoners informing them of the risks posed by communicable diseases; a detoxification and drug free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug free therapy programme co-ordinated by the Probation and Welfare Service and delivered by a multi-disciplinary team is in place.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a second drug treatment programme began at the health care unit in Mountjoy in March 2000. This offers detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over 12 weeks to prisoners nearing release with a view to returning them drug free onto a structured drug treatment programme in the community.</P>
      <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request the Director General of the Prisons Service recently established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Health Board, <Col N="735" /> senior prisons service management, probation and welfare service, prisons psychology service and the prisons education service. The group submitted its first report to myself in July of this year and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. These are due to commence immediately.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals he has to increase the level of maintenance grant for students at third level and to substantially increase the income limits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26354/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants schemes, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant and 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The reference value for inflation for the purpose of the annual review is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to February. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>In the present financial year expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million.</P>
      <P>In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins my approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged <Col N="739" /> grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>

      <P>The case of the young person to whom the Deputy refers was before the High Court on 14 November 2000 and was brought to the attention of my Department that morning.</P>
      <P>From time to time difficulties can arise in accommodating individual children on the first day on which placement is sought in any of the young offender centres, due to pressure on places on a given day. However, in this case, my Department was able to advise the court that a place was available for the young person in St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Centre, Finglas, Dublin 11. The judge ordered the placement of the young person to St. Michael's until 15 December 2000 pending placement in Trinity House special school.</P>
      <P>The young person was before the Children's Court previously in January 1999 and was placed in St. Laurence's special school, Finglas, Dublin 11, until January 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exploring masculinities programme is a programme of personal and social development for young men participating in the transition year programme or one of the leaving certificate programmes. It is one of a number of support programmes for teachers in this area of the curriculum and was developed over a five year period by teachers working with officials from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme manual, including teaching materials, and video are available to schools as resource materials. They can be used as a stand-alone programme in transition year, or can be <Col N="740" /> integrated into some of the standard senior cycle programmes for second level schools. Second level schools are free to offer the programme or to use it as resource material, subject, as with any other similar programme, to the agreement of parents and the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>The programme covers a wide range of issues relevant to the lives of males and puts them in the context of the changes affecting the lives of men and women in the world of today, economic, legislative and social. These changes have implications for the economic, personal and social lives of men as well as women and yet there has been little attention paid to how they are affecting men's lives. While attention has been paid to how women's roles have changed over the past 25 years and this is reflected in girls' educational experiences, boys' educational experiences have not reflected these changes to the same degree.</P>
    <P>The programme constitutes a response to recommendations from research carried out in second level schools nationally, and recommendations contained in a number of Government reports. It is set within the framework of the recent equality legislation in this country and in the EU, specifically the Amsterdam Treaty, and within the framework of this country's commitments to international agreements.</P>
    <P>All Departments have a responsibility to promote equality and anti-discrimination and, as education is one of the key areas where the foundations for a broadening of attitudes and tolerance for diversity can be established, both of my immediate predecessors rightly considered that this initiative should be undertaken. This programme is one of a number of initiatives in the area of equality in education which have been undertaken by my Department over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In the light of the recent public debate on the programme, I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which has a statutory function under the Education Act, 1998, to advise me on all aspects of the curriculum, to undertake a review of the programme, including the views of teachers, parents and young persons participating in the programme.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that, in undertaking this review, the council should have regard to best practice in this and other countries, to the implications of current relevant policy and legislation in this area and the issues raised in the current public debate.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a discussion of this and any other newly developed or revised curricular programme by the Joint Committee on Education and Science, once the process of development and review has been completed.</P>

      <P>While an extension was sanctioned for Coláiste Cionn Torc, Castlepollard, County Westmeath, in 1985, this project did not proceed due to declining enrolments.</P>
      <P>In 1996 approval was given to County Westmeath VEC to appoint a design team to provide additional accommodation on the Coláiste Cionn Torc site. Following the commencement of the architectural planning process, it became apparent that the site was inadequate. In early 1999 it was decided to acquire a green field site in the area so as to provide a more suitable campus. Architectural planning was deferred pending the acquisition of a new site.</P>
      <P>Now that a suitable site has been acquired and paid for, it is envisaged that this project will progress quickly through the remaining stages of architectural planning.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the pay and conditions of service of teachers.</P>
      <P>In addition to basic salary, teachers receive annual allowances in respect of certain qualifications. Teachers are also paid a range of additional allowances for additional duties. The majority of our teachers join with honours qualifications and start teaching at a salary of £20,636 rising to £34,821, while a principal of a medium size second level school with honours qualifications would be paid a total of £50,026.</P>
      <P>Claims for improvements in the conditions of service of teachers are processed through the conciliation council for teachers. Apart from the increases in salary which have been granted as part of national agreements, significant improvements have been made over the years in the conditions of service of teachers including the provision of additional teaching posts, the extension and improvement of arrangements for the award of incremental credit, new management structure for schools with a significant increase in promotional posts for teachers, increased allowances for posts of responsibility, new career break and job-sharing arrangements and the payment of qualifications allowances for all recognised teachers.</P>
      <P>The future of our education system is dependent on there being a well qualified and committed teaching force in our schools. Teachers do very valuable work and should be paid accordingly. In this regard the public service benchmarking body, which has been set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will shortly commence to undertake a fundamental examination of public service pay and jobs, including the role and pay of teachers, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. The PPF provides for negotiation on the implementation of the outcomes of this benchmarking process in the context of negotiations on the arrangements which will follow the PPF.</P>

      <P>When the following pay scales and <Col N="743" /> associated qualification allowances together with other conditions of service applying to teachers are considered together, the total remuneration and overall conditions of service of teachers remain competitive.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that a teacher with the basic qualifications will commence on the third point of the scale and will also be paid the appropriate qualification allowances.</P>

      <P>The curriculum in second level has been revised to a significant degree in recent years. Following the introduction of the junior certificate, all syllabi were revised by 1994 and wider forms of assessment were introduced for some subjects. More recently my Department, in conjunction with the NCCA, has been engaged in a consultative exercise with the partners in education on the junior cycle curriculum. This process is examining the overall curricular provision particularly with regard to additional forms of formative assessment to assist in better reporting to parents during the three-year cycle and summative assessment at the end of the cycle.</P>
      <P>The junior certificate school programme has been introduced to schools to meet the needs of some pupils unable to follow a full junior certificate programme. The senior cycle programme has been significantly changed, with the transition year programme available to all schools, and a choice of three two year leaving certificate programmes &ndash; established leaving certificate, leaving certificate vocational programme and leaving certificate applied. This suite of programmes not only gives a broader vocational dimension to general education but also, in the case of the latter programme, provides a programme more suitable to the needs of many pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underpinning these curricular changes has been a greater emphasis on quality assurance, particularly in the area of examinations, whole school evaluation and school development planning. The examinations system has been refined, made more transparent and inclusive and procedures quality assured. Schools have been <Col N="745" /> encouraged and supported to embark or develop further their school development planning and self-evaluative processes. School development planning deals with the setting of targets and specification of achievement objectives in the context of enhancing the quality of learning and teaching in schools. Following a very successful pilot programme, my Department is finalising its proposals for whole school evaluation, a process of assuring the quality of educational provision in the system as a whole. Underpinning all these various processes is the active involvement of teachers, school management, parents, industry, other agencies and local communities in a collaborative partnership process.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 over 1,200 additional teaching posts have been allocated at second level. As a result of this increase in resources all second level schools have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education; all designated disadvantaged schools have been invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme; the minimum allocation in respect of guidance has been raised; additional teaching resources have been allocated to schools offering the leaving certificate applied and-or the junior certificate schools programme; teachers who would otherwise have been liable for redeployment have been retained in their schools; and the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes has been reduced from 19:1 to 18:1.</P>
    <P>The quality of the second level infrastructure has been significantly improved over the past three years through a programme of sustained capital investment. By the end of the current year, £112 million will have been expended on capital projects. For the next year, I have secured from Government an unprecedented £125 million for investment in second level infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased by £7 to £184 last year and has been further increased by £8 from September this year to £192. I am particularly pleased to announce another significant increase of £10 for the next school year, bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant over £200 for the first time.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have introduced the schools services support fund under which schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year.</P>
    <P>Schools have also benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. By the end of 2000, £41 million will have been allocated to second level schools under the initiative.</P>
    <P>Schools have welcomed these improvements. It <Col N="746" /> is my intention to improve further the funding of second level to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available to the officials of my Department. Teachers in primary schools are appointed and employed by the managerial authority of the school. In the event that the managerial authority of a primary school is unable to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher at a particular time, it may appoint a person who is not fully trained in a temporary capacity. The managerial authority must continue to make every effort to obtain the services of a fully qualified person, including re-advertising a post.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures have been introduced by the Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares to an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post-graduate course will commence early in 2001 with a proposed intake of 280 students, bringing the total enrolment to 1,280.</P>
      <P>It is projected that the intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared to 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year, persons employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for a period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU, whose qualifications have been accepted by my Department, will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>At second level, it is a matter for the school authority concerned to determine how approved teaching resources are to be utilised having regard to the curricular and other needs of the pupils in the school. Similarly, where a vacancy arises, it is a matter for the school authority to decide on the subject areas to be catered for.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of individual second level schools in the areas referred to by the Deputy that are experiencing difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. Neither is my Department aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current school year.</P>

      <P>Depending on the severity of the disorder, children with autism may be catered for in special dedicated facilities or in integrated settings where they can be supported by the resource teacher and the special needs assistant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the decision of my Department in November 1998 to recognise the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism, a total of 63 special classes dedicated to children <Col N="749" /> with autism have been established to date. Each of these classes operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has the support of a special needs assistant. These classes are capable of catering for up to 378 children with autism. Further such classes are being established as additional needs are identified.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a range of measures to further enhance the range of education services available to children with autism. These measures include the introduction of a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism; the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to all special classes catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are currently being made to give effect to the above measures.</P>
    <P>I am also appointing an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in this area and to liaise with the work of the special task force on autism which I recently established and which has been requested to report to me within three months. I am also appointing a clinical psychologist to advise on the needs of individual children with autism.</P>
    <P>Children with milder disorders can be capable of attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with autism, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers catering for children with special needs, including children with autism, has increased from 104 to more than 560. The number of special needs assistants deployed to support such children has increased from 299 to more than 1,400 over the same period. Details of the number of children with autism who are currently availing of these services are not readily available in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service, subject to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; subject to a maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, with effect from September of this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. The school referred to by the Deputy is one of the schools that has benefited under this phase of the scheme.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools are, for the first time, receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the proposal referred to by the Deputy, which relates to the development of education and therapeutic support services for a group of 14 children with autism in the Galway area.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held recently between representatives of my Department and the service providers in the Galway area in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the educational needs of the pupils in question and the level of support required.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, children with autism are catered for in special dedicated classes in special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. Each special class operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has the support of a special needs assistant. The necessary therapeutic services are provided by the relevant health authority.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that all children with autism have access to the support services they require within the education system. In keeping with this commitment, I recently announced a range of new measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services available for children with autism. These measures include the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for all children with autism, the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the measures which I have now introduced, coupled with any further developments which prove necessary arising from the task force's report, will ensure that all children with autism, including those in the area referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require within the education system. In the meantime, my Department's inspectorate will continue its efforts to ensure that suitable provision is put in place for the children to whom the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>My Department recently received a report regarding the provision of a school transport service to the national school in question.</P>
      <P>The position generally is that a school transport service may be established or retained where there is a sufficient number of eligible children, living in a distinct locality, offering transport to their nearest national school. A minimum of ten pupils is required to establish a service. In order to be eligible for free transport, children between the ages of four and ten must live at least two miles from their nearest school, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
      <P>In this case, the number of eligible children offering for transport from this locality is only two. The remaining 15 pupils are either ineligible due to their proximity to other nearer schools or because they do not meet the distance requirement.</P>

      <P>My Department recently received a report regarding an extension of the school transport service for the pupil referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position generally is that primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>My Department may, however, consider special transport arrangements on medical grounds where it is shown that a child is severely medically handicapped and the condition is such that the child could not make his-her own way to the pick-up point.</P>
      <P>The medical evidence submitted on behalf of the pupil in question was forwarded to the medical advisor for attention. The medical advisor, however, has determined that the medical grounds submitted do not warrant an extension of the service.</P>
      <P>Transport from the existing pick-up point, which is 0.8 miles from the family residence, continues to be available to the pupil in question.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the higher education grant application for a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim and have it approved in view of the fact that the information supplied clearly established that she is an independent mature student maintaining herself for three years and is not dependent on her parents for financial support; if he will make a favourable decision in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the Acts, a mature student is defined as a person of <Col N="754" /> not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either mature students dependent on parents or independent mature students. A mature student dependent on parents is defined to mean a mature candidate who was ordinarily resident with her-his parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Maintenance grants may be paid to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his-her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students, other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the 1999 higher education grants scheme &ndash; the relevant scheme in this case &ndash;&ldquo;independent mature candidate&rdquo; means a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his-her parents from 1 October 1998. A mature candidate dependent on parents means a mature candidate who was ordinarily resident with his-her parents from 1 October 1998.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the student to whom the Deputy refers, resided with her parents from June 1998 to August 1999 and, accordingly, she can be assessed only as a mature candidate dependent on parents.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>
      <P>However, it is recognised that the provisions outlined above can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and my Department is examining the issues involved. I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for the individual child, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communication system, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English. If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
      <P>If the option is for Irish signed language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is a growing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium of communication and teaching. Special needs assistants, who are proficient in sign language, have also been provided for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
      <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultations with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and individuals, including individual parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has also been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made to establish a representative advisory committee which will offer guidance on key future developments in the education of the deaf, including the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to Irish sign language and communication with non-deaf children.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals he has to abolish the 15 mile limit in regard to the upper and lower level of maintenance grant at third level colleges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of clause 5 of the higher education grants scheme, maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from the college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college each day, having regard to the journey and available transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant. The schemes of third level student support, since 1995, provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from the college.</P>
      <P>In any such grant scheme terms and conditions have, of necessity, to be introduced and it is considered that the 15 mile adjacency condition is a fair and reasonable one. Any proposal to pay all grantholders at the higher, non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant would have significant cost implications and would have to have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
      <P>In the current financial year expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million.</P>
      <P>In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, on 11 November I announced that I was setting up immediately a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. The review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students.</P>
      <P>I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely <Col N="757" /> initial step, pending the findings of the group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grantholders, targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question on 30 September 1999 of 52 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher, which is the same staffing as the school had for the 1999-2000 school year. The school also has the services of a shared learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>An enrolment of 56 pupils on 30 September 1999 was required in order to appoint a second mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>Recently an inspector from my Department examined the staffing position in the school. I regret that there are no grounds for the appointment of an additional teacher to the school for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The correspondence to which the Deputy refers has just recently been received in my Department and is currently being considered.</P>
      <P>I understand that the children in question are currently enrolled in a special class for pupils with autism. This class operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and has the support of a special needs assistant. A second special needs assistant has also been appointed to assist with the particular needs of one of the pupils in question. My Department also recently sanctioned home tuition hours to assist another one of the pupils and a second application for such support is currently receiving consideration.</P>
      <P>The provision of therapeutic support services for the children in question is the responsibility of the relevant health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that all children with autism have access to the support services they require within the education system. In keeping with this commitment, I recently announced a package of new measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services available to the children in question. These measures include the immediate introduction of a nationwide pre-school education service for children with autism; the exten<Col N="763" /> sion of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>I am also appointing an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism to advise my Department on the development of services in this area and to liaise with the work of the special task force on autism which I recently established and which has been requested to report to me within three months. I am also appointing a clinical psychologist to advise on the needs of individual children with autism.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures which I have now introduced, coupled with any further developments which prove necessary arising from the task force's report, will ensure that all children with autism, including those referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require within the education system. I also assure the Deputy that the points raised in the correspondence to which he refers will be fully considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The position generally is that, in order to be eligible for free transport, children between the ages of four and ten must live at least two miles from their nearest appropriate school, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
      <P>The pupil referred to by the Deputy resides 1.7 miles from the school concerned and is ineligible for transport on distance grounds. She can be facilitated with concessionary fare paying transport, from the nearest pick-up point, 0.4 miles from her home. Concessionary fare paying transport may be allowed to ineligible pupils on condition that there is room available on a service after all fully eligible pupils have been accommodated and provided no extra cost is involved by way of extending or altering the route of service.</P>
      <P>I regret that, as the child concerned is not eligible for transport to the school in question, it is not open to my Department to extend the service to her home as requested.</P>

Each year, my Department informs each VEC of its quota of VTOS places from the total of 5,000 available overall. The VEC selects the students for the programme and returns statistical information periodically in connection with grant payments. This information relates only to actual students and my Department receives no information on applicants. In the current academic year 2000-01, demand for VTOS places is generally high and some vocational education committees have a waiting list. The following table lists the allocation to and numbers of VTOS places filled by each VEC in the academic years 1998-99 and 1999-2000.<Col N="765" /></P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years' duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are, however, a number of excepted courses, including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses, including those leading to the award of bachelor of education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>
      <P>As the person to whom the Deputy refers, is pursuing a B.Ed. honours primary education course in the United Kingdom she is ineligible for assistance under the terms of the student support schemes.</P>
      <P>While my officials are reviewing the arrangements applying in relation to the excepted courses, I advise the Deputy that there are no exceptions to these arrangements, which are of general application.</P>
      <P>Apart from the funds provided specifically for the schemes of student support there are no other funds at the disposal of my Department out of which financial assistance can be made available. However, the British Council in Ireland offers advice and assistance to Irish students studying in Britain. The council also has information on scholarships offered by the British Government to Irish students. The British Council offices are located at Newmount House, 22-24 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, telephone 01 6764088.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 November, I announced the immediate setting up of a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation <Col N="768" /> measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>Teachers in primary schools are appointed and employed by the managerial authority of the school. In the event that the managerial authority of a primary school is unable to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher at a particular time they may appoint a person who is not fully trained in a temporary capacity. The managerial authority must continue to make every effort to obtain the services of a fully qualified person, including re-advertising the post.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify the position relating to the particular teacher mentioned by the Deputy. Substitute teachers are employed where a teacher is absent on paid sick leave or maternity leave, whereas temporary teachers are employed where a teacher takes unpaid leave of absence. The teacher in question, who is currently on career break from her teaching post, was employed by this particular school as a temporary teacher pending the appointment of a permanent teacher. Under career break regulations, teachers cannot take up employment in a temporary or permanent capacity in a primary school. Should a board of management appoint a teacher who is on career break to a short-term temporary position, it is on the understanding that the teacher is paid at the unqualified rate. Accordingly, it is not possible to pay this teacher at the trained common basic scale rate while she serves in a temporary capacity in the school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 445 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level, temporary accommodation has been provided at existing schools in the Naas area to cater for immediate requirements. Architectural planning for a new 16-classroom school is also under way and it is expected that, when this building becomes available, there will be sufficient accommodation available in the town to meet medium and long-term requirements.</P>
      <P>At second level, the position is that, following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the Naas area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. It is envisaged that, when these projects are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation available to meet future needs.</P>
      <P>However, the area will continue to be closely monitored by my Department to ensure that any emerging additional requirements are addressed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the ASTI survey which found that 69% of second level schools have had difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers to teach one or more subjects since the start of the school year and, of the 55% of schools which did not successfully fill posts, 38% were forced to employ an unqualified person; and if he will radically amend the terms and conditions of all teachers to ensure the profession is sufficiently attractive to ensure posts can be filled in view of a similar trend in the primary sector.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware from the survey undertaken earlier this year by the ASTI that some second level principals have experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. However, the position at second level is complicated by regional and subject variations. A further factor is that vacant positions often require teachers with specific subject combinations.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Higher Education Authority have been closely monitoring the situation at second level. Following a survey of principals and graduates completed in 1997, I have increased the number of places for the higher diploma in education by 25%. A review of the supply and demand position of second level teachers will continue on an ongoing basis. Since 1 August, 1,100 new appointments of qualified teachers have been made in second level schools and the number of applicants exceeded 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Claims for improvements in the conditions of service of teachers are processed through the Conciliation Council for Teachers. Apart from the increases in salary which have been granted as part of national agreements, significant improvements have been made over the years in the conditions of service of teachers including the provision of additional teaching posts, the extension and improvement of arrangements for the award of incremental credit, new management structure for schools with a significant increase in promotional posts for teachers, increased allowances for posts of responsibility, new career break and job-sharing arrangements and the payment of <Col N="775" /> qualifications allowances for all recognised teachers.</P>
    <P>When the pay scales and associated qualification allowances and the other conditions of service applying to teachers are considered together, the total remuneration and overall conditions of service of teachers remains competitive.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the trend for textbooks to have shorter useful lives and the greater expense that this trend puts on families of pupils as well as the added contribution that disposal of old textbooks makes to the waste crisis; if he will take steps to ensure school books are published with longer years of service in mind with a facility perhaps to add supplementary updated information inserts from time to time; and if he will issue guidelines in this regard to schools and publishers while encouraging the establishing of book hire or book loan schemes in schools.</Quest>

      <P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. School authorities have been advised regularly that textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. Textbooks have to be changed periodically, however, to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date. It is unavoidable, therefore, that some textbooks will become obsolete over time. I am satisfied, however, that the problem of disposal of unwanted textbooks is minimised to the greatest possible extent by the policies operated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance misuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
    <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Seed capital grant aid has been provided to schools at second level which are categorised as disadvantaged, which did not already have a loan rental scheme in place and which gave a commitment to arrange for such a scheme, to assist them in the establishment of book loan or rental schemes. The intention is to provide some specific financial seed support for the introduction of book rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis, for a maximum of six years &ndash; five years in the case of five-year cycle schools. It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan or rental schemes which, after the initial special assistance, will operate on a self-financing basis where ongoing costs will be met by fee income, which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grant scheme allocation.</P>
    <P>At primary level schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes. I continue to urge all schools to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
