      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. <i>a</i>17, motion re Nomination of Member of the Government; No. 4, Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 40, the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999, Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that proceedings on No. <i>a</i>17, if not previously concluded should be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. The speech of the Taoiseach and the main spokespersons for Fine Gael and Labour, who shall be called upon in that order, should not exceed 20 minutes in each case, while the speech of other Members shall not exceed ten minutes. Members may share time. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be called upon not later than 12.50 p.m. to make a speech in reply, which will not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>What has happened the White Paper on Defence? The Taoiseach is very ready to appear in photographs with the Defence Forces and the flack jacket has become the favoured fashion accessory of the Government. In April the Taoiseach promised that the White Paper would be published in July. In October he promised publication in December and in a statement in December he promised it would be published the following week. However, the White Paper has not yet been published.</P>

      <P>The question was raised yesterday on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked the question yesterday and the answer has not changed overnight. We lost a few weeks over Christmas. The White Paper has been circulating in Departments and we hope it will be with the Government the week after next. I did say it would be available in December, and I regret not <Col N="466" /> publishing it at that time. However, it will be available as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he first promised in April last year that it would be published in July of that year? He may have lost some weeks over Christmas for whatever reason, but he did not lose the entire summer. A Government that can lose weeks is quite good at altering time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend coming to the House early next week to report progress in relation to the national talks on a successor to Partnership 2000? Does the Government intend having a debate in the House prior to the agreement, if there is one, being put to the various social partners for ratification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions are ongoing and I do not propose making a statement. Parliamentary questions on the matter have been tabled and I will give an update next week. The normal course is that the agreement is debated at some stage and it will be debated in line with the precedent which has been established over previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does he agree that, given the evolution of social partnership, the debate in this House should take place before any final ratification is sought from the social partners? In view of the increasing legislative commitments which such agreements entail, does he see a role for the House in expressing its view in the context of the social partners expressing their views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and as far as I recall, this is what has happened previously, certainly in relation to the PCW, as I remember contributing to the debate. However, I do not recall the precise timing of that debate. However, the House has a view to express.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1999 I moved a Private Members' Bill on activity centres, the spirit and intent of which was accepted by the Government which did not oppose it. The Minister promised that he would try to have legislation in place before the summer recess last year. Will the Taoiseach raise the matter with the new Minister who will be appointed to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and ensure the legislation and regulations are put in place as soon as possible? The Taoiseach might indicate where it appears on the legislative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a report on this matter last year and the Deputy is correct about what was stated at that time. The heads of a Bill are being prepared by the Department. It is major legislation which will establish a regulatory regime for safety in adventure activities and provide for the establishment of a statutory authority. The heads of the Bill are expected shortly <Col N="467" /> and it is hoped the legislation will be passed by the middle of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past year and a half there has been much talk about putting in place an effective solution to tackling the deafness compensation claims which have cost millions of pounds. Not £1 has been negotiated in terms of reducing legal fees being charged and neither has effective compensation been agreed to. I raised it on a number of occasions and was informed that there would be no legislation. According to the new legislative programme which has been published, there will be legislation in the middle of this year and this postpones another effective solution for several more months. Will he clarify what is happening in regard to this issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of growing concern at the rise in racism and racist attacks, does the Government have any plans to review the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act under which it is alleged no prosecutions have taken place since its enactment in 1989? Does it need to be reformed? If so, does the Government have any plans in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question for the Minister whether there is a review. However, it might be news to the Deputy, but the Minister has launched a campaign to try to curb any racial tendencies that exist. That campaign is receiving widespread support.</P>

The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, <Col N="469" /> 1999, was introduced before Christmas but seems to have disappeared. Given the Glen of the Downs issue and the fact that Dúchas has been shown to have provided wrong advice, that Bill should come before the House again urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing ministerial changes, I wish to speak about the two Ministers who, at their own wish, are resigning from office. I would like to pay warm tribute to Deputy Andrews on a second distinguished term as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I believe he has left his own substantial and distinctive mark on the proud foreign policy traditions of this State. He spoke to me about stepping down last autumn but I asked him to stay on until the Mitchell Review was complete, with the prospect that he would oversee the coming into being of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout his political career, Deputy Andrews has made an important contribution to the development of peace and justice in Northern Ireland. In 1968 he served on the all-party committee with the late Séan Lemass that made certain recommendations concerning the approach to unity in the Constitution that are very much reflected in the changes resulting from the Good Friday Agreement. He also played an active role in the New Ireland Forum. As a backbencher in the 1980s, he led the all-party campaign within the Oireachtas to obtain the release of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and Annie Maguire on the grounds of a serious miscarriage of justice, a position which was completely vindicated. In his much respected contributions inside and outside the Dáil, Deputy Andrews has always <Col N="471" /> attached much weight to civil liberties, when reforms in criminal law and social legislation have been debated.</P>
    <P>Having been Minister of State in Iveagh House from 1977 to 1979, Deputy Andrews was first appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1992. He participated in the earlier round of multi-party talks. From October 1997, he represented the Government throughout the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement, where he led a very strong Government team. Warm appreciation of his contribution has been expressed in the past few days by some of the leading members of the main pro-Agreement parties, both Unionist and Nationalist.</P>
    <P>In addition to Northern Ireland, Deputy Andrews will be remembered particularly for his internationalist approach, his initiatives with other countries to work towards complete nuclear disarmament and his role as EU representative in East Timor. In a previous Government, he was the first to highlight the humanitarian plight in Somalia, together with President Robinson. He has also conducted a very effective campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council, which we hope to bring to a successful conclusion over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Working in partnership with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, there has been a substantial expansion, by about a third in real terms discounting inflation, of the overseas development aid programme administered from within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Purely statistical arguments related to GNP tend to ignore and downgrade the expanding aid contribution that this country is making. What matters, as I saw recently in South Africa, is that we are doing more on the ground, and our aid is not tied.</P>
    <P>The Government and the House can be grateful for the important qualitative contribution that Deputy Andrews has made to political life and to Irish foreign policy. He has, with his brother Niall, been a standard bearer of a proud and continuous family tradition of public service going back to the foundation of the State. I know he will continue to make an important contribution during the remaining years of this Dáil, and I extend our gratitude and best wishes to his wife Annette and his family for the support that they have given him in his 35 years of public life.</P>
    <P>It is also with great regret that I have to announce the decision of the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Chris Flood, to stand down from his position. He is doing this for health reasons and on medical advice. He has also informed me that he will not contest the next general election. Deputy Flood, who has served in this House since 1987, has made a major contribution to policy on social inclusion. He has played a particularly significant role in the practical development of the rights and entitlements of the traveller community. As a result of his work, <Col N="472" /> significant advances have been made in the position of travellers in this country, and there is now more understanding of the problems facing their community and the need for sympathetic action to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood has also played a major role in co-ordinating the national drugs strategy and, in particular, the development and extension of services and facilities for those suffering from drug addiction, with particular reference to young people at risk. He has been in charge of local development, giving support and encouragement to community groups who are combating social exclusion. The budget for local development has been doubled to £33 million this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood has represented Dublin South-West at local and national level for 21 years to date. There have been enormous improvements and investment in the area, and especially in Tallaght, and Deputy Flood deserves a generous share of credit for the progress that has been made in transforming the area. For my party, Deputy Flood represented so much that is best in working out and implementing a caring social policy.</P>
    <P>Consequent on these developments I now move:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Frank Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and at the Department of Education and Science (with special responsibility for Children) for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>In addition I wish to advise the House that I intend to make the following ministerial reassignments.</P>
    <P>I propose to assign responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs to Deputy Brian Cowen, for the Department of Health and Children to Deputy Micheál Martin, for the Department of Education and Science to Deputy Michael Woods and for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to Deputy Frank Fahey.</P>
    <P>Subject to the motion which I have tabled being approved, Deputy Fahey will cease to be Minister of State on his appointment as a member of the Government. Accordingly, I intend to recommend to the Government:</P>
    <P>that Deputy Eoin Ryan be appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation with special responsibility for Local Development &ndash; he will also be responsible for the National Drugs Strategy Team; and that Deputy Mary Hanafin be appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and at the Department of Education and Science, with special responsibility for Children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> I would like to make one comment on the Cabinet changes and some of the speculation surrounding them. In any Government, but most especially a minority coalition Government, the role of the Government Chief Whip is absolutely vital. The present Chief Whip, Minister Seamus Brennan, whose long political experience is of great value to the Cabinet, would have a strong claim at this stage to return to a departmental Ministry. He is, however, indispensable to the good running and functioning of the Government as a whole, and indeed of this Dáil, and I am, unfortunately, not in a position to spare him for another purpose.</P>

      <P>The Government is roughly half way through its term. We intend to pursue with vigour the mountain of work that remains to be completed so that not just the Government but the Dáil as a whole can present an excellent report on both achievements and work in progress to the electorate when the time comes.</P>
      <P>The economy has done far better than anyone imagined was possible in 1997. The current boom which started in 1993 to 1994 has been successfully sustained and is now into its seventh year. Unemployment has fallen to 5%, and we effectively have full employment. Thanks to high economic growth and a series of good budgets, living standards are on the rise. But we also want to end poverty and promote equal opportunity and social justice. Important negotiations on a new partnership agreement are under way in a good atmosphere. Yesterday we published framework legislation for the minimum wage, an initiative of this Government adopted during the last general election. We have produced a very ambitious national plan, following successful completion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations at European level. We intend to see the programmes set out in the plan implemented and completed on time. All this is being done without recourse to borrowing, with the general Government debt having fallen to 47% of GNP. We want to tackle poor infrastructure and inadequate services, especially where they exist in health, education and the environment. We, more than any previous Government, have been able to generate the resources that can fund major improvements. We have at the same time exercised budgetary prudence, so that we can cope with a downturn as well as with the increased cost of funding pensions in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Real progress has been made in Northern Ireland. The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are now fully working to general satisfaction but there are still important hurdles to be crossed before the new settlement can take root fully. The Government, as reconstituted, <Col N="474" /> will, I am confident, do excellent work over the next two and a half years with a continuing high level of public support. I commend the new appointments of Ministers and Ministers of State to the House.</P>

      <P>Good times and good government are not the same thing. Good times make it easy for a Government to be popular. They do not necessarily mean that we get good government. Good government is about making decisions that need to be made. It is about leadership. It is about thinking of the long-term and confronting problems before they become acute. It is about leading opinion rather than following it. This Government is characterised by &ldquo;followership&rdquo; rather than leadership. The Government follows public opinion, it does not lead it.</P>
      <P>There are three areas where the Government is falling down &ndash; the drugs issue and related crime matters, the health service and traffic. There are now 13,000 heroin addicts, 1,000 more than we had a year ago. Narcotic drug abuse is a symptom of a deeper problem. On average eight out of every ten young people now complete the leaving certificate examination yet only one out of every ten heroin drug addicts have completed it. Two-thirds of those in Mountjoy are regular drug users, a huge increase in the position a few years ago. People fall victim to the pushers of heroin because they are leading dead end lives. They are leading dead end lives because the education and training system has failed them, their parents have failed them or they have been born in the wrong place.</P>
      <P>This Government has spent a lot of money on the drugs problem but it has not solved it. It has set up structures, task forces and held many meetings. Government word processors churn out long lists of good intentions but results are not being achieved. The level of narcotic addiction is rising all the time. The drugs problem is getting worse not better yet nobody can say which member of Cabinet is ultimately responsible for the battle against narcotics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few weeks we have seen a renewed outbreak of violent crime. There were six murders in the past three weeks; there were three murders in one day. Many of these were due to narcotics, to battles between narcotic suppliers and the psychiatric dislocation cause by narcotic abuse. Unlike Tony Blair, the Government is not giving any moral leadership on the drugs issue. It is unwilling to confront the choices people make. It is unwilling to say some choices are wrong and <Col N="475" /> others are right. No one should be offended so nothing is said.</P>
    <P>The Government has increased the amount it spends on health by 45% in the past two and a half years. However, nobody would be foolish enough to say that the health services have improved by 45%. If anything, they are much worse than they were two and half years ago. We are spending money but not getting results. That is the most eloquent indictment of any Government. A Government that spends money but does not get results is not a good Government and we do not have a good Government as far as health is concerned. The health services epitomise the two-tier system that exists today. If you are one of those lucky enough to be covered by health insurance you can get help to manage your pain. They can get help to have an operation performed quickly, to have their teeth seen to or other health needs met. On the other hand, those relying on the public health service because they are medical card holders may remain a long period in chronic pain. They may die while waiting for their operation. Their teeth may rot in their heads, and their health needs will only be met after everybody else has been looked after. That describes the health service we have in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>This Government has been unwilling to tackle the vital issues of reorganisation of medical manpower in the hospitals. The patients' charter is being ignored in our biggest hospitals. The casualty departments are full because the Government has been unwilling to make decisions, unwilling to govern. The subvention available to families who have an elderly person in a private nursing home is totally inadequate; it averages about £100 per week while the fees in some health board areas are £400 per week or more. More and more families are worried now that if an older member of their family gets sick and needs long-term care, they will not be able to afford the cost of a nursing home.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach is one that spreads the benefit of the nursing home subvention so thinly across all cases, families with substantial means and families with little or none, that it amounts to only a fraction of the weekly cost. Under this Government of plenty, these new Celtic philanthropists, those on unemployment assistance get £74 per week. That is less than the cost of an expense account lunch for two in a Dublin restaurant today. It is worth thinking of that the next time one signs a bill in one of those places.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into office, 4,000 child care places have disappeared and have not been replaced. Parents are under pressure, parenting is under pressure, children are under pressure. No one really knows the <Col N="476" /> long-term effect all this pressure will have on today's children when they grow up. Intuition, not science, can be our only guide here because there are few precedents to study. It is said that the conditions of early childhood determine the way we will live as adults. That is certainly true of heart conditions and so forth. Are our children really getting the stability, the care, the consistency and the calm they need in the early part of their lives? What price will they ultimately pay for today's Celtic tiger?</P>
      <P>The third area in which the Government has been a complete failure is that of traffic. The traffic jams are a testament to political weakness. The Luas has been long-fingered. The Minister is so concerned, as are other Ministers, to avoid unpopularity that she has evaded her responsibilities to make quick decisions about Dublin transport. Bus competition has been long-fingered. Park-and-ride facilities, long promised, have not appeared, yet bus corridors without park-and-ride facilities make no sense at all.</P>
      <P>We have a national development plan but no national spatial plan. The Government has made no choice about growth centres. The Government knows what it wants to build but cannot make up its mind where it wants to build it. It is leaving the physical shaping of Ireland for the next century to property developers and land borders. That makes no sense at all. Developments are being held up because there are insufficient planners in our county councils. The councils need about 600 more staff if they are to process planning applications. The Planning Appeals Board has become the biggest single bottleneck to development in Ireland. Archaeological sites are being destroyed by development because Dúchas staff are overwhelmed by applications and cannot examine them properly.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about releasing a new dynamic in our economy through privatisation and public-private partnership, yet the Eircom privatisation has left a sour taste in the mouths of long-term investors. The only people who are happy are those who sold their shares quickly &ndash; hardly the sort of investor a Government wants to attract. Other privatisations are stalled. Public-private partnerships, without user fees, are just a new form of State borrowing and they, too, are coming on-stream painfully slowly.</P>
      <P>The current reshuffle has been occasioned by the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews has shown a social conscience, notably in regard to East Timor and, more recently, Chechnya. I wish him well and pay tribute to his long political career, during which he stood up to Mr. Charles J. Haughey when many of his recent Cabinet colleagues had nothing at all to say, no questions to ask and just signed on the dotted line, so to speak.</P>

      <P>The Government is now <Col N="477" /> entering the autumn of its existence. It took very few radical decisions during its spring or its summer. We can expect little enough now. Once the reshuffle is over, the focus of comment will gradually shift towards the run-in to the general election, whenever it happens, towards the alternatives to the Government, towards a new vision of a more proactive and less complacent Administration. Fine Gael is ready for that. We are doing the work. Real politics is now resuming as the Dáil prepares for a general election.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I would like to pay tribute, and I am sorry he has left the House, as has Deputy Andrews, to Deputy Flood. I regard him as a serious politician, somebody who worked hard but worked with a clear purpose in mind, somebody who was not just solely interested in re-election but who wanted to change things, and did make changes.</P>
      <P>I will not make any comment on the suitability of any of the Ministers who have been appointed to the particular offices for which they were chosen. I do not think anybody should be prejudged and the talents of people should not be categorised as readily as they have sometimes been. I will be as vigilant a critic of the new Ministers as anybody else, but this is not the appropriate day to say they are not suitable for the particular job for which they were chosen. Time will tell whether they are suitable, and the Opposition will do all it can to ensure that any failings are exposed. On a day such as this, however, I wish them well and I hope they will not &ndash; I am sure they will not &ndash; pay much attention to some of the rather crass characterisations that have been made of some of them. I have one particular person in mind with whom I have crossed swords in the past and will do so in the future, but I am sure he is paying no attention to some of the characterisations that have been made of him.</P>

      <P>May I first pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Andrews? He is an honourable man who has given great public service and I would like to express my thanks to him for the many courtesies he extended to me as Foreign Affairs spokesman during his term of office, and to wish him well in his retirement. I would also like to join with Deputy Bruton in thanking Deputy Flood for his many courtesies and for the manner in which he carried out his duties. I wish Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy Mary Hanafin well in their new posts as Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of Deputy Andrews' departure from the Department of Foreign Affairs is dreadful. I do not know why this particular time was chosen. Deputy Andrews is Chairman in Office of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe. He was in the middle of seeking a seat on the Security Council of the United Nations and an Intergovernmental Conference is under <Col N="478" /> way on the Portuguese Presidency. This is not good timing for the departure of a Minister for Foreign Affairs and I wonder why it was done at this time.</P>
    <P>Given my view of the priorities that should be concerning this Government, I say with all honesty that the areas of Dún Laoghaire and Dublin South East are not where the most experience of those priorities will be found. I have raised in this House the fact that 75% of prisoners in Mountjoy come from five identifiable areas in Dublin. If they do not go into prison with a drug problem, there is a good chance they will come out with one. Mothers come to me to ask if I can have their sons moved from Mountjoy so they do not pick up a drug habit. Nothing is being done about this, there is no mention of prison reform.</P>
    <P>Local authority house building rates in the State are the lowest in all Europe. There was a time in the last 20 years when Dublin Corporation built 1,700 houses a year. We will be lucky if they build 300 houses this year. Is it any wonder there is a housing crisis? Local authority house building has a contribution to make to dealing with the crisis but only 300 houses were built last year.</P>
    <P>Only 15% of Dublin city's inner city dwellers can aspire to third level education. The norm for the rest of the county is 50%. Eight out of ten young people expect to do their leaving certificate but among those who are heroin abusers, the figure is only one in ten.</P>
    <P>The teeth of poor children can go crooked while they wait for an orthodontist. If, however, their parents can pay, they can have treatment today. An old person on crutches, in pain, waiting for surgery must suffer that pain unless he or she has a cheque book, in which case he or she will be seen to today or tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients, some of them living alone, on £74.30 a week were left to their own devices at Christmas, left to the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the goodness of private enterprises such as Dunnes Stores, which generously donated clothes. The State, with £5 billion of a surplus last year alone, ignored all of these people.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs pretending that she would resign if the Government did not agree to an interim contribution of 0.35% of GNP, rising to 0.45%, on the way to a 0.7% of GNP contribution to world hunger, we have yet again failed to meet that 0.35% target. There is no hope that we will meet the 0.7% of GNP contribution to world hunger target. In the meantime 10 million children &ndash; a holocaust every year &ndash; die per year from easily preventable diseases and hunger.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party told us it would stand by the Republic. Some standing by. Some Republic. This is the Republic the Government presents to us today: educational apartheid and social injustice institutionalised, and world hunger ignored. Not one decent, pro-active proposal for social justice has come from this <Col N="479" /> Government in its two and half years in office. The appointments made today do not give any indication that the Taoiseach understands the constituency of people to whom I have referred, those needy, poor people who suffer terrible injustice and who see no hope in this two tier Republic.</P>
    <P>I wish the incoming Ministers well, but if they want to make a mark I suggest they address this agenda. We can do something about world hunger. If this State meets its 0.7% of GNP contribution to world hunger target by 2007, £600 million by that time, many millions of children may live. We can then put pressure on other EU states to make their contribution to the prevention of world hunger and disease. This should be the Minister's priority in foreign policy on his appointment.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Ministers well and I hope these issues will be addressed by the House itself because there are people in society who have been left behind, without hope or care, and they are the people on whom we should be spending our billions of pounds of surplus.</P>

      <P>The change in a Government midway through its term of office is a time of opportunity for those fortunate enough to be promoted and a farewell for those who have chosen to resign. Deputy David Andrews is one of the longest serving Members of this House, elected in April 1965. He comes from a distinguished political family and has given great public service to this State. This is not the day to offer a critical analysis of the many contributions Deputy Andrews has made in this House but it is ironic that one reason he is so respected across the political spectrum is for his courage in opposing the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Mr. Haughey. That says a great deal about Deputy Andrews but, sadly, it says an awful lot more about other party members.</P>
      <P>I pay particular tribute to Deputy Chris Flood. I have worked with him on the problems related to drugs. I am clear, as is my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, about his courage and commitment to combatting a scourge which afflicts every urban area in the State and now, sadly, rural areas as well.</P>
      <P>That Deputy Flood has chosen to resign for reasons of health is an indication to us all that the toll of the lifestyle of politics does not make exemptions. I wish him and his family well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Fahey. I am aware of the long time and dedication he has given to politics. He has experienced the joys of political success and the hardship of political defeat. I can understand how he must feel about the recognition that he, his family and his supporters in Galway West are experiencing. I wish him well. I take this opportunity to draw to his attention a booby trap his predecessor left in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the nonsensical and illegal requirement that Dublin Port should <Col N="480" /> apply for planning permission for a piece of ground which does not yet exist. He should consult the newly appointed Minister from Dublin South East to see how to delicately defuse that nonsense. Now the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources can safely look at his constituents on the road to Sutton and not feel that he is responsible for the consolidation of Dublin Port or compensating it for the loss of the 22 acres of land which the construction of the port tunnel will remove. No doubt the sensitivities of the voters of Galway West will embolden the new Minister to make such decisions and enable him to do the right thing for his Taoiseach on whose constituency this port depends. Nice one Deputy Woods, but it did not work.</P>
    <P>I express my pleasure at seeing my constituency colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, being recognised at last and I wish him well. We have worked well together on a number of occasions and no doubt, with the drug problem which exists in our constituency, his local knowledge and commitment will be an advantage. I look forward to working with him.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Hanafin on her prompt recognition and promotion. Rarely has someone come into this House and been promoted in such a short time.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs is a man of undoubted experience. He will probably be the first Irish Foreign Minister who cannot walk into the negotiating chambers of the General Council with the traditional béal bocht mentality that characterised many of his predecessors. Ireland is now a rich nation and will be expected to behave as such. We will be expected to give leadership in the Councils of Europe, not silently sit at the end of the table hoping nobody will cast their gaze upon us and thankful for the grants of money from whatever quarter that have been allocated to our economy. The days of the outstretched lámh are over and the politics that underpinned and informed them are redundant.</P>
    <P>We expect from the new Minister a vision of what this country can contribute to the construction of the European project. Traditionally, Iveagh House has been dominated by issues in Northern Ireland. Hopefully, after the report from General de Chastelain next Monday, a new chapter will unfold that will enable the people of Northern Ireland and of these two islands to progress to a new plane of normal politics. The consequence of that will be the release of many diplomatic and political resources currently focused on that issue to the wider stage of how this country will play its part in a European Union that will enlarge over the next ten to 15 years to embrace up to 30 new member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland, which now has a population of just over 1% of the total population of 370 million, will find itself with almost 1% of the population of the enlarged Union. In today's newspapers it is reported that the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, is once again suggesting options as to how to deal with the left<Col N="481" /> overs of Amsterdam. One commissioner per country but a two tiered Commission as the price for that option has been put forward by Germany, France, Britain and Italy. How this country starts to construct alliances with other countries which are similarly affected will be a critical test of the new Minister's stewardship in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Of the previous six short-listed countries prior to Helsinki &ndash; the list is now enlarged to 13 &ndash; three of the applicants have populations smaller than that of the Republic of Ireland. How many of the other countries, such as Latvia and Lithuania, or even Slovakia with a population of approximately five million, will have populations that are either smaller or similar to ours? How the constitutional balance of the emerging European Union will take shape in a manner that recognises the identity of nation states yet sensitively pools their sovereignty while respecting the necessity for some form of democratic accountability will be a major task. Sadly, the Taoiseach, to my knowledge, has not engaged in it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, has an opportunity, because he undoubtedly has the ability, to engage in that debate. Indeed, he will be expected to lead that debate and not, as some of his Fianna Fáil predecessors did, quietly sit back and allow the debate to proceed until such time as Irish interests were threatened and only then make an intervention. We are entering our 27th year of membership of the European Union. Countries such as Austria and Finland, with less than three years membership, look to our experience and our skill in using the corridors of Brussels and elsewhere to give a lead to those member states which do not have the old traditional, imperial clout of Germany, France, Italy or Britain or who did not, until recently, have the economic clout which we now possess. The Minister faces a major challenge. I will not go into some of the offensive comments which have been made about him because the challenge is much bigger than that both for him and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach could have moved a few more Ministers. Why has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not been moved? Why has a most outrageous deterioration in social values been presided over by a man whose administrative acts cover us in shame? Anybody who saw &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night must wonder what type of country we live in. Is there any folk memory in Fianna Fáil of the &ldquo;No wogs, no dogs, no Irish&rdquo; attitude that so many of our people had to endure? This is being visited daily on people who came in hope to this country with the same expectations our ancestors had when they went to Liverpool and the new world. Where is the folk memory of Fianna Fáil that it can permit the travesty that is going on at present?</P>
    <P>There is no moral high ground on this side of the House. There is no lack of understanding of the fears racism can generate among people who are ignorant and have no experience. We are no <Col N="482" /> different from and no better and no worse than anybody else. However, we have the advantage of other people's experience and of seeing what can go wrong if it is ignored. This Administration is ignoring, at everybody's peril, the problems arising on our streets, not just in Dublin 4 or the city centre but throughout the country. I am sorry the Taoiseach did not move the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He had a chance and he blew it.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Health and Children has a wonderful reputation for announcing spending by the Department of Education and Science. He is an experienced and committed teacher and has offered his views in a sophisticated and elegant way about what can be done in education. The new Minister, Deputy Woods, if he can find where the money is buried, will attempt to fulfil the former Minister's spending commitments, but the former Minister will still get the credit. The Minister, Deputy Woods has been around a long time&mdash;</P>

      <P>At least he has the hair to dye it. We now have the opportunity to recast the structure of the health service. We have the opportunity and the wealth to remove the health apartheid system that is getting worse by the hour.</P>
      <P>The former Minister and some previous Ministers for Health had a difficult task. Limited resources, archaic structures and internal rivalries and divisions within the system of medical provision presented great obstacles to reform. There is now a crying necessity to reform the structure of the health service so that people are treated on the basis of their health needs, not their cheque books. People have a right to be treated equally as patients just as they have the right to be treated equally as pupils in the schools for which the Minister, until a few moments ago, had responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an enormous task. The challenge is whether this Fianna Fáil coalition Government has the vision to confront it and to rebuild the health service. I do not hold out much hope for the Minister. He is surrounded by two lethal conservatives, the Tánaiste on the one hand and the Minister for Finance on the other. I invite the new Minister to examine the small print of the three year programme for expenditure which the Government submitted to Brussels as part of its stability programme. In current account terms, we are committed to spending less of our bur<Col N="483" /> geoning wealth than even the United States. In two years, 25% of our GNP will be devoted to the provision of services.</P>
    <P>On the index of well being which is a combination of <i>per capita</i> income, literacy as a test of education and infant mortality as a test of the quality of health services, the United States scores lower than Ireland. The Taoiseach should never turn his back on the Minister for Finance because he is a committed conservative who has induced and allowed the Cabinet to commit itself to impoverishing the nation in terms of its public services. The Holy Grail of never ending tax reductions will impoverish the country, except for those who are rich enough, powerful enough or influential enough to buy their way out of misery. We are facing a two-tier society that will condemn people to walk with some kind of emotional, mental or physical limp because they were denied opportunities at a critical time in their lives. These critical times only come once. One does not get endless decades of opportunity to be re-educated, cured or given a chance to grow up healthy and strong. This Government is the first to have the resources to ensure that, where it can be avoided, nobody will walk with a limp but the Minister for Finance, propped up by the so called Progressive Democrats, is committed to the Holy Grail of never ending tax reductions. The Government will be tested on its ability to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be tested on two points by this side of the House. We cannot be serious participants in the European Union unless we have a presence in every applicant member state. Of the pre-Helsinki six applicants for full membership of the EU, we do not have resident embassies in Cyprus, Slovenia or the Estonian Republic. It costs £400,000 to run an Irish embassy. The Taoiseach has committed approximately £280 million with an ongoing subsidy of £10 million per year to the national stadium project. We need a presence in applicant countries or the Minister will not be able to do his job. His voice must be heard loudly and clearly in demanding representation for this republic with our future partners in a European Union that will determine the nature of our society in the future.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party published a Bill on Monday of this week which I sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs because it would impose a charge on the Revenue and cannot be placed on the Order Paper. I offer this Bill to the Minister as an entrance present to Iveagh House. Let us forget the nonsense about incrementalism in relation to overseas development aid. Why not increase ODA in one step and statutorily increase our allocation from the current figure of 0.31%; the figure has gone down because of the manner in which it is now calculated as a percentage of GNP. If we can build a stadium of the size the Taoiseach is proposing why can we not, in the millennium year, celebrate our new wealth by increasing our allocation for overseas aid to 0.75 <Col N="484" /> of a penny &ndash;  less than one penny in every pound of our national wealth and so small an amount that we do not even have a currency unit to express it. There is an endless number of projects on which the money could be spent. The Taoiseach gave a procession of photo opportunities in southern Africa and at every one of them he heard endless demands for more help. We have recently commemorated the great Famine. Let us go into a century in which we can do something to alleviate hunger.</P>
    <P>These are the tests the Labour Party will apply to this Admistration which has been sadly revamped but not revamped enough.</P>

      <P>I would like to share the Green Party time with Deputy Ó Caolain and Deputy Joe Higgins. Deputy Sargent has asked me to say a few words because of the elevation of my constituency colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>
      <P>I join with others in wishing Deputy Andrews well. We have had vigorous disagreements in the House on foreign policy and particularly in relation to PfP. I am sure he will not want to hear those initials in his retirement. Outside the Chamber he was always affable, courteous and helpful. I remember with gratitude the fact that he arranged facilities for a meeting between myself and the Foreign Minister of Germany, Joschka Fischer. He has done good work in relation to East Timor and on behalf of the Birmingham Six and he has done unstinting work in relation to the peace process.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to Deputy Flood and congratulate all the new Ministers, including Deputy Fahey, and the new Ministers of State, Deputy Hanafin, whose promotion has been quick and all the sweeter for that and, in particular, my constituency colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan. I remember when we both stood unsuccessfully for election in 1987 and 1989. Those were great disappointments but I am sure this is a day he will always remember. In Dublin South-East we are looking forward to the great things he will achieve for the constituency because with power comes responsibility. I am sure we will have many remedial teachers in our schools and that Deputy Ryan will get rid of the incinerator in Ringsend and wave his magic wand in many different ways. I am pleased for Deputy Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is an appalling Government. It is reminiscent of the Government of 1977 which almost ruined the country. The Government is like a deck of cards in a Las Vegas casino. No matter how many times it is shuffled the people will always get a bum deal. The actions of the Government have been typified by the recent Thatcherite budget. The Government's problem is that it does not understand the difference between standard of living and quality of life. In other industrial countries we have seen that, since the 1970s, as the standard of living and the GDP increased, the quality of life decreased. If things are so good why is homelessness on the increase, why do we have a housing crisis and why are <Col N="485" /> there so many problems in the rented accommodation sector? The Government is familiar with these problems and yet they continue. Why do we have increased family breakdown and depression? Why is there an increase in male suicide if things are so good? Why do we have a traffic crisis and gridlock in this city? </P>
    <P>The Government has done nothing for the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency report which was published last summer shows that all the negative indicators &ndash; air quality, water quality, soil erosion, habitat destruction &ndash; are on the increase. Yet the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has sat back and done absolutely nothing. What is he doing for the environment? There was a real need for a reshuffle in that Department but the Taoiseach missed that opportunity.</P>
    <P>We have a crisis in child care. The budget was a disgrace in relation to child care. The question of hospital waiting lists has not been dealt with adequately. We even have the problem of banning a herbal medicine, St. John's Wort, which is used by 75,000 people. What a short sighted way to deal with a relatively simple problem. We are the only country in Europe which has banned this herb. The gap between rich and poor has increased and will continue to increase under this Government, which espouses a greedy solution to everything. The term &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; was the philosophy of Gordon Gecko in the film &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo;, and it is also the philosophy of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is ready to enter Government. We are in Government in five EU countries: France, Belgium, Italy, Germany and Finland. The Green Party has performed well in those countries. We would like at some stage to enter a coalition here. One issue we would emphasise is quality of life. I hope the Government examines that issue. If it ignores it, I guarantee that the people will eventually recognise that it has done so. It has been quite a honeymoon so far for the Government, but eventually the people will see through it and will understand that all the talk about GDP is just a gloss. If quality of life is decreasing, the Government will be found out.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet changes announced by the Taoiseach are not sweeping but provide the Government with the opportunity to take stock and move forward in a more positive direction. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration has failed to manage the prosperity in sectors of the economy. I say &ldquo;sectors&rdquo; because the economy in 2000 is characterised by gross inequalities. The central failure of the Government has been its unwillingness to ensure the sharing of the prosperity. The new Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science must, above all, address that inequality which is at its most glaring in our schools and hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newly appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs comes into office at a crucial time in the <Col N="486" /> peace process. The fledgling institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement are up and running but have yet to become firmly established. Demilitarisation and the equality agenda have yet to be implemented. I wish the new Minister well in his post, not only on my behalf but on behalf of my colleagues in the Sinn Féin leadership. We look forward to working closely with him in achieving lasting peace and justice in our country.</P>
    <P>I also wish to impress on him the importance of not only defending but also developing and building upon neutrality, an issue of conflict from my position and perspective with his predecessor. The railroading through the House of membership of NATO's Partnership for Peace was one of the darkest days in the history of foreign policy. The new Minister has the opportunity to take stock, and I urge him to seek a new direction and resist the push for the State to become involved in superpower games, be they NATO-led or EU-led.</P>
    <P>I wish each of the new appointees well in their respective positions of responsibility. I wish Deputy Flood well for the future.</P>

        <b>:</b> This is a Government which does not deserve the support of ordinary people or the Dáil. It pushes at every turn the freebooting greed which characterises capitalist globalisation at present. Fianna Fáil claimed at one stage to be the defender of public enterprise in the State sector, but it is now selling out the most vital publicly-owned services to private individuals who are allowed to engage in the most blatant speculation with property and services which rightly belong to the people.</P>
      <P>We witnessed the disgusting spectacle a few weeks ago of people walking away with hundreds of millions of pounds in their back pockets as a result of having sections of the vital telecommunications industry given to them as a blank cheque by the previous Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and that cheque then being cashed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. This is only months after the Government sold out the entire telecommunications sector. What does it think will happen when the Celtic tiger goes belly-up, which is inevitable under the rules of the market economy worldwide? All our vital services will then be in the hands of multinationals. Where will their concern be for Irish workers then? The Government is tobogganing over the edge to disaster as far as working people are concerned by putting more of the economy into multinational hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incredibly party colleagues in local government crudely mimic their elders in Government. Drogheda Corporation privatised its refuse service overnight without consulting the people. The first people heard about it was when a private collector informed them that, in two weeks' time, it would collect the refuse and that it would cost a certain amount. The Government gave a paltry £150 to £200 as a tax concession in the budget to <Col N="487" /> low-paid workers on PAYE, yet its colleagues on Drogheda Corporation want to take that away overnight by charging low-paid workers and vulnerable people £150 a year for refuse collection. It is an incredible spectacle.</P>
    <P>The people glorified by the Government are the super rich tax exiles. These are people lauded by the Taoiseach and the Government but whose sense of patriotism is such that they take up their abode outside the country so they can pay less tax.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis continues to cause enormous pain to tens and hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country. The housing crisis was allowed to develop by the parties in Government by their stepping aside and allowing a small cabal of speculators and developers to take control of the market. Now hundreds of thousands of people cannot contemplate the idea of putting a roof over their heads, one of the most basic human needs and rights, not to mention the enormous suffering on local authority housing waiting lists. Incredibly, the Government continues to stand aside while this group holds people's lives to ransom. The Government does not deserve support. I will certainly vote against the nominations.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I join previous speakers in paying tribute to the outgoing Ministers: the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. I am sorry to hear the departure of the Minister of State is on the basis of ill health. We hope he recovers his full health, vigour and <i>joie de vivre</i>. I extend my sincere good wishes to the incoming Ministers, that is, those who are changing portfolio: the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who goes to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister, Deputy Martin, who goes to the Department of Health and Children and the Minister, Deputy Woods, who goes to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I wish well the two new Ministers of State in their new job portfolios. I have had the pleasure of serving with Deputy Eoin Ryan, who has been a superb Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, and with Deputy Hanifin. I asked Deputy Hanifin at a meeting at 7 o'clock yesterday evening if it would be her last meeting in that capacity and she assured me it would not. I do not know if she got the signal at that stage or whether she was playing hard to get or being coy about it. I wish both of them well because I have seen them in action at close quarters on the committee and they have been two superb performers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I join in the general feeling of the Opposition that this reshuffle represents a glaring missed opportunity. I am disappointed and dismayed by the missed opportunity on the part of the Taoiseach in not getting rid once and for all of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One would have thought he would have used the opportunity to get rid of the dead wood, <Col N="488" /> to take the square pegs out of the round holes, to send a clear signal that the performance was not satisfactory, to send him for an early shower or to the dugout, or to give him the red card. That opportunity was missed. No other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the history of the State was given such largesse. The largest ever budget in the history of the State was given by way of the recent Estimates &ndash; £847 million. Yet, there has been a situation where not alone has there not been any action, there have not been any answers and no performance.</P>
    <P>On 11 January last, the State brought charges before the Special Criminal Court in the Jacqueline McIntyre case. This was the guns in the post case. A person was caught red-handed importing by way of the post guns from the United States, clearly for paramilitary purposes. In court the defendant's solicitor read out an anonymous letter and as a result the State asked that the charges be withdrawn despite excellent surveillance work on the part of the Garda Síochána. It now transpires that this anonymous letter had nothing to do with it. If so, why has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not explained in public the reason the State, having vigorously prosecuted the charges, decided to do a complete U-turn in court?</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last, 25 January 2000, the Special Criminal Court did exactly the same thing. On the instructions of the Chief State Solicitor, the Director of Public Prosecutions asked that charges be withdrawn against two Derrymen caught in possession of explosives and arrested by the Garda Síochána in Letterkenny. We are entitled to an explanation as to why charges were withdrawn in both cases. Has it something to do with the sensitivity of the peace process?</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 18 January 2000, the best indication of the disarray and chaos surrounding asylum policy was the resignation of Mr. Peter Finlay, senior counsel, as independent appeals adjudicator because he could no longer stand over the charade. He did the honourable thing and resigned. Despite this the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to huff and puff that the asylum procedures he has put in place are adequate. Applicants have to wait up to two or three years in legal limbo and queue in degrading conditions on Lower Mount Street. There has been no attempt to introduce a proper dispersal policy or ensure applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible. There is no openness, magnanimity or welcoming which, as Deputy Quinn said, should be part and parcel of the Irish psyche given our sad experience spanning 150 years.</P>
    <P>In opposition the main pitch of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was law, order and public safety. Day in, day out he railed against the then Minister, Deputy Owen. It was almost as if she was responsible for every robbery, raid, rape, murder and mugging. The blame was laid firmly at her door. Let us look in graphic detail at what has happened in the wake of his <Col N="489" /> promise to introduce a policy of zero tolerance. In the last three months of 1999 the Dublin Airport branch of Bank of Ireland was raided and nobody was arraigned. There were also bank raids in Tallaght and Finglas. In the case of the raid at the American Express headquarters in Nassau Street, less than 500 yards from Leinster House, the female bank manager was taken from her Blanchardstown home the previous evening and brought at gunpoint to open the safe. In the case of the raid at the Ballyfermot branch of the AIB the two raiders who were armed to the teeth entered through the back window and escaped with a substantial sum of money. The vast majority of those involved in these raids are still at large.</P>
    <P>It looks as if the new millennium will be even worse. On 1 January a 21 year old was shot dead in Ashbourne. On 6 January a security van was attacked in Douglas, County Cork, by armed robbers who escaped on a motorcycle. They are still at large. On 9 January a naked body was taken from a cold canal in County Kildare. Foul play is suspected. The teenager concerned was tied to concrete blocks and consigned to the canal because he was unable to meet the repayments on a consignment of drugs for which he had borrowed money and which had been seized at Dublin Airport. It was payback time. On 10 January there was an armed robbery at the Fassaugh Avenue post office. On 13 January shots were fired during a raid on the Balbriggan branch of Bank of Ireland in which a substantial sum of money was taken. The four raiders involved are still at large. The car used in the raid was found burned out one and a half miles away. On 16 January there was an armed raid at the Three Rock Hotel in south Dublin in which shots were fired and £50,000 was taken. There were three killings last weekend &ndash; two in Limerick and one in Drogheda. On Tuesday night there were two armed raids smack in the middle of Dublin city. There does not appear to be any clear plan in place to deal with the spate of gangland killings and raids despite the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>The most pertinent statistic is to be found in the quarterly household survey published by the Central Statistics Office. It is clearly indicated that 30% of the population do not feel safe when walking the streets at night. This increases to a dramatic 48% in the case of women over the age of 65. One in every eight homes has been hit by crime. A total of 12% or 154,000 homes are hit annually. There have been 99,000 acts of vandalism.</P>
    <P>Despite the commitment of money and because of the lack of a coherent plan &ndash; the man sitting to my right did not have enough time to tackle it &ndash; the drugs problem is eating into the core of society. Surveys show that two thirds of young people are dabbling or have the potential to dabble in heroin or cannabis. Despite this there is no indication of a coherent strategy to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The prison system is in chaos. There was a <Col N="490" /> record number of suicides last year. There is no prison philosophy, mission statement or clear vision of what we expect from the prison system. Drugs addicts come out more damaged. I regard this reshuffle as a missed opportunity.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that. I am not much good at pulling pints whatever about giving lip. I welcome the changes which have been made and pay tribute to Deputies Andrews and Flood for the service they have given. Deputy Andrews is a man of great character and integrity. He has shown a great sense of purpose throughout his political career. If I was asked to name his guiding principle that is the one I would choose. He has always had a cause of great worth and in respect of which he was prepared to give leadership. He brought these talents to the Department of Foreign Affairs and will be sorely missed. I have no doubt he will continue to show his crusading qualities in what will be a full and active life.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flood comes from my constituency of County Westmeath. I worked with him for three months in the Department of Health and Children and found him to be loyal and trustworthy. He always gave of his best. He has played an enormous role in the past two and a half years in giving due prominence to the traveller issue and in tackling the drug culture.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes at ministerial level. Deputy Woods is the new Minister for Education and Science. I look forward to observing him in that Department which, although full of the most excellent mandarins, needs a firm hand. He will bring to the Department his great experience of life. If one could work 24 hours a day, it would ask for more. I wish him good luck and look forward to welcoming him to County Westmeath. I had already cajoled Deputy Martin into coming.</P>
      <P>What can one say about my midlands friend, Deputy Cowen, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs? He will be a great success. He will bring to the Department his intelligence, wit, pugnacity &ndash; which is needed in any Department &ndash; and sense of purpose. More and more, people worldwide are realising that a country's size does not affect the influence it can bring to bear on matters of international importance. In the past, only representatives of the bigger countries spoke and were listened to. As a small country with a strong history, a record in social and economic matters and a record of achievement in Northern Ireland, we can bring all that expertise to bear on the world stage. We are extremely pleased that Deputy Cowen will be bringing his qualities to the foreign affairs position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins is very funny. Deputy Rabbitte referred to &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; earlier and that is what is behind his laughter. I cannot help it, if I am like the person who parodies me on the programme, I can only say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to him. Perhaps I should change my style but it is rather late in my life to do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin has been a huge success in the Department of Education and Science and I do not have any doubt that he will be equally successful in the Department of Health and Children. I recall when former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, informed me that I was to be given the health portfolio. I was only in the Department for 12 weeks until St. Valentine's Day when many of us lost our jobs. However, I enjoyed my time in the Department. I used to return to my flat at night with bundles of files and dictionaries to translate the medical terms. I would like to have remained longer in the Department at the time although I would not like to be sent there now. Deputy Martin has youth, vigour, determination and a strong streak of individualism which will doubtless enable him to put his own stamp on the Department of Health and Children, as Deputy Cowen did.</P>
      <P>We also have two new additions to the composite ministerial team. I am delighted that Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy Hanafin are joining us. The Ministers with whom they will be working will have to keep on their toes because these two Deputies want to make an impression and I have no doubt but that they will. From speaking to people on the street and others who telephoned me, there is obviously great enthusiasm for the two appointments. Our team will be greatly strengthened. Change is good. Although I was not offered a new position, I am very happy at what I am doing and have a great deal more to do. I would not like to be interrupted mid-stream. I am very happy that others are moving but that I am staying put.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton poses as a paragon of integrity, honesty and steadfastness, qualities he maintains Government Members do not possess. Yet, Deputy Bruton stood in this House today and told untruths. I will not repeat them as we are not allowed to tell lies in this House. The untruths related to Luas. I have with me a copy of the indicative timetable which I issued and which I will issue again to all Deputies if they want it. Each of the targets set have been met and most of them have gone ahead of the indicative timetable. I will send the timetable to Deputy Bruton although I am sure he will not read it and will continue to say the kind of dotty things he said this morning when he asked for a chorus of assent if we thought this was the best Government. Of course, we do. The idea that somebody would ask the Government what it thought of itself is&mdash;</P>

      <P>I reserve my last word for the new Member of Cabinet, Deputy Fahey. I have great affection for Deputy Fahey with whom I worked for five years in the Department of Education where he was a Minister of State with responsibility for sport. He was a great comrade. Deputy Fahey was prepared to be interesting and imaginative long before those qualities, which he had in abundance, were admired in politicians. He did not lose his sense of inquiry, consideration and reflection over the years. Above all, he did not lost his drive to get things done. I am sure that he will bring those considerable qualities to bear in his new position as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

I have had the pleasure of working with Deputy Andrews for the past 26 years in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency and have always found him to be of the highest integrity. He gave his all to any job he undertook. Deputy Andrews did an excellent job as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He represented the country exceptionally well and will be a great loss to politics, particularly to this Government which could make good use of his talents for the remainder of its tenure. In the 26 years I have know him, Deputy Andrews and I have never exchanged a cross word. If politics means anything, it is that we should confine our debates to this Chamber and work together outside of it for our communities. I wish Deputy Andrews well and thank him for the past 26 years.</P>
      <P>I also wish Deputy Hanafin every success. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has been a good constituency in terms of being represented at Government level. I wish Deputy Hanafin well in her new post and I am sure she will do a good job. I also wish Deputies Eoin Ryan and Fahey every success.

      <P>The Taoiseach prides himself on being a Manchester United supporter. I am sure he has attended many of the Manchester United and Arsenal matches. The chant of the Manchester United supporters from the Stretford end is always &ldquo;boring, boring Arsenal&rdquo;. The first comment that comes to mind in regard to this reshuffle is that we are increasingly seeing boring, boring Bertie. At a time when there is a clear sign of fatigue, tiredness and staleness in the current Administration, he has again opted for the minimalist approach, leaving the same old tired faces in many Departments and not availing of the opportunity to freshen them up. By the time the next general election comes round, the electorate will also be fatigued and will seek to make the appropriate changes.</P>
      <P>On a personal level, I would like to be associated with the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Barrett, about Deputy Andrews whom I always found to be an utterly charming gentleman. Deputy Andrews has had a distinguished political career and I wish him and Deputy Flood well in the future.</P>
      <P>I have not ceased to be amazed at the outgoing Minister of Health and Children's ability to hide his intellect behind his pugnacity. Nevertheless, I wish him well and hope that the endless hospitality and finger food in Iveagh House will not bore him to death. He is out of Angola now, so to speak, and faces an onerous job in regard to the next phase of reconciliation in Northern Ireland. I hope Deputy Cowen will be part of a process which will broaden the sense of Irishness, one which will make Mr. David Trimble as Irish as someone whose grandfather fought in the GPO in 1916. I did not know how big a hole would be dug for the prospective Fianna Fáil leader and Minister for Education and Science, but it is pretty big in Health and Children. The poisoned chalice was going to be Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Health and Children. I wish him well in that very difficult job, in what is in effect a leaking bucket. His talents will certainly be required.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pass a brief mid-term judgment on this Government. The point made by Deputy John Bruton this morning is the most important. The fact that people are experiencing economic prosperity and growth in jobs does not mean we have a good Government. Increasingly people are separating the question of whether things are going well for the country and whether we have a good administration or could have a better one. On many areas the Government is in a state of paralysis. It is very good at spending money, availing of photo opportunities and spin doctoring on the way it spends money. However, on the critical issue of how to sustain the boom, it has done little or nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no integrated transport plan. We are 20 years behind the rest of Europe in relation to bus competition. I have consistently advocated the need for an equivalent of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, which has suc<Col N="494" /> cessfully regulated independent radio, to do the same for public transport. The public transport licensing system is a joke, and the law is disobeyed on a daily basis. In relation to traffic gridlock in Dublin, there is no move to integrate Owen Keegan's work in traffic management with the subvention and running of Dublin Bus, road management, local authority management or the management of Operation Freeflow. We need a Dublin transport authority that will integrate all these. However, because it is interdepartmental, the Taoiseach has done little or nothing about it. We have no plan to go alongside the national development plan. We have had much talk about public-private partnerships but little action. The School of Music in Cork is the only one that is up and running. In all these areas where political action is needed to change things, little or nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I can go through the issues. Little or nothing has been done about traffic gridlock. The mismatch between supply and demand in housing is driving up house prices and a whole category of young people who could normally aspire to home ownership can now forget about it and may look forward to renting their homes for the rest of their lives. Little or nothing is being done to build the extra 40% of houses that are required over the next decade. That means a mindset adjustment, a sea change in relation to sanitary services and infrastructural development to open up new land for development within urban areas and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On child care, we put forward a specific proposal that children under five years of age should get £25 a week. We have fallen between stools in the debate on this issue. We substitute analysis for action, and nothing is done.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, the waiting lists for elective cardiac surgery are so long that a person has to have a heart attack before he or she is taken into hospital and is then moved from hospital into a cardiac treatment unit. People who are walking around are not sick enough to make any progress on the waiting list. I know of many such examples.</P>
    <P>On skills shortages, one of the key impediments to the continuation of the Celtic tiger is the inability to move people from welfare to work and to ensure we have adequate numbers of skilled workers. Many jobs paying £5 or £6 an hour remain unfilled. There is no radical plan. The simplest thing would be to provide that for people earning under £170 a week, the minimum pay, their gross pay and their net pay would be the same. The Government has failed to address that issue.</P>
    <P>On taxation, the biggest issue is that people go on to the top rate of tax at too low an income. What is needed is not to cut the top rate of tax but to introduce a new rate of 35%. There has been no imagination in dealing with these issues, no new responses. We continue the dialogue with the social partners. The Government and the Dáil have been substituted for a consensus process, <Col N="495" /> and the Government has shown no flair or imagination.</P>
    <P>In the area of agriculture, there has been a record drop in incomes. We have had an unprecedented crisis in the beef sector and a failure on the part of Government to get to grips with meat processors and income supports.</P>
    <P>There has been no imagination in the area of decentralisation at a time when a radical approach is required.</P>
    <P>Most of all, we cannot ensure an equal society if we are not true to ourselves. We live in an unequal society. The obligation on politicians is to provide equality of opportunity at school leaving stage. The fact that one in ten children leave school at primary level highlights the failure of our education system to tackle disadvantage and equality of opportunity. We have had a Minister for teachers. Successive Ministers for Education become Ministers for teachers. What we need is a Minister for equality of education.</P>
    <P>I will continue the battle on Luas with the Minister. The Government took an atrocious decision in May 1998 which it is now reversing. I wish the new Ministers well. However, we have the same old tired Government, with the same old tired leadership. The real change we need is a change of Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to pay tribute to some of my colleagues who are retiring or being promoted. Let me pay a personal tribute to Deputy Andrews, the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs, who resigned. I have had a long association with him. I served with him as a Minister of State. That was my first experience as Minister of State and I found Deputy Andrews to be very courteous and helpful to me personally during that time. Stories are often told about Ministers and their Ministers of State and the difficulties they face in getting anything to do in the Department of Foreign Affairs. That is something of which Deputy Andrews was never guilty. He allowed me free rein in the areas for which I had responsibility. Throughout his career he has shown a deep commitment to many humanitarian causes. He is known for that not just nationally but internationally. His greatest achievement in politics was his contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent putting in place of that agreement in Northern Ireland which paved the way for peace on this island. That is something of which we are all very proud, but in a particular way Deputy Andrews can be proud of the role he played. We can only hope that from now on that very good foundation and what has happened since will be built upon. I wish Deputy <Col N="496" /> Andrews and his family well in the future. He will continue to serve in this House until the next election in two and a half years' time and will retire at that stage. However, I expect that he will still keep a lively interest in humanitarian issues.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Cowen on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I could say many nice things about him but I know he would only blush and be embarrassed as he is here with me at present. He has shown a capacity for leadership in his previous Ministries. He has an obvious determination and tenacity in the jobs he has been called upon to do. It is recognised by all Members of this House that the job of Minister for Health and Children is not an easy one, and he served in that role with distinction. His intellect and strength of character will be necessary in his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs representing this country abroad. I have no doubt he will be able to fulfil that role. His commitment to the mentally handicapped and the programme he put in place &ndash; including the provision of funding &ndash; will be a lasting legacy of which he can be proud. It will be remembered by everybody in the years ahead. He had to fight many vested interests to prioritise this issue but he succeeded in doing that. His achievement has been well recognised by all sides of the House, the service providers and advocacy groups. I have no doubt that in his new role at the Department of Foreign Affairs he will leave further legacies.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate Deputy Woods on his proposed move to the Department of Education and Science. He is probably the most experienced member of the Cabinet having served in several ministries with distinction. Given the detailed knowledge he acquired in each of them, I have no doubt he will do a good job in his new portfolio.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Minister, Deputy Martin, is to move to the Department of Health and Children. He has proven to be innovative and dynamic and has had the courage to tackle a number of thorny issues. Most importantly, he has the ability to take strategic long-term views and lay the foundations for the future. He had done this in education, science and so on and he has shown he is not afraid to face challenges. I disagree with the Deputy Yates's assessment that he has been a teachers' Minister. He has served the country well and has brought education into the 21st century. Certain aspects of it needed that.</P>
    <P>I pay warm tribute to Deputy Flood who served as Minister of State with distinction. We served jointly on the task force on local government and local development and I worked closely with him in this area. He has been deeply committed to issues of social inclusion and to efforts to combat drugs in the various drug task force areas. He has also shown a deep commitment to eliminating disadvantage. He worked with me as Opposition spokesperson on travellers and the recent travellers accommodation Bill and other moves in this area were largely the result of his work there. I am sorry to see him go and in the <Col N="497" /> circumstances outlined by the Taoiseach, and I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Fahey. He is probably one of the most experienced Ministers of State. Most people will probably remember him as a Minister of State with responsility for Sport. He showed his resilience by coming back from defeat in the 1992 general election and returning to the Dáil and the Government as Minister of State in 1997. I have no doubt he will make a huge success of his new portfolio. It is an area in which he has a special interest.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition I worked with Deputy Eoin Ryan in the area of urban renewal and the environment. I will also work closely with him in his new portfolio. He will bring to it dedication and commitment.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Hanafin in her proposed new role in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. We have worked together, not in the Dáil but in the Fianna Fáil Party, where I got to know her in recent years. I have often heard her comment on issues dealing with children and child care. As a teacher she will bring her experience to bear on her new portfolio. I wish all my colleagues every success.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the retiring Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I worked opposite Deputy Flood in recent years and the tributes paid to him are well deserved. He inherited a detailed policy brief from Deputy Rabbitte, who had developed a comprehensive policy regarding the ministerial task force on the role of sport and recreation as a preventative element in the fight against crime and drugs. Deputy Flood utilised that policy effectively when he was Minister of State. I regret he is obliged to resign for health reasons. I congratulate all those who are to be appointed.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy Cowen will display more diplomacy in his new role than he did as Minister for Health and Children, where he mixed arrogance with indifference. He should have learned earlier that it is not enough to throw resources at problems. Throwing resources at health is like pouring water into a leaky bucket, if they are not matched with strong management and reforms. As a consequence many defects and inefficiencies remain in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minster's attitude to health was peevish at times. I am not whingeing when I point out that one of his first acts was to get rid of a number people on the health boards, including me. His indifference was demonstrated by his failure to replace us. Places were left vacant up to the time of the local elections. That says much about his <Col N="498" /> indifference to the Department. It also showed in the lack of reform in health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent flu epidemic should have been planned for, yet hospitals were ineffective in dealing with the rush of elderly and even younger patients into the system. Accident and emergency beds were filled with people suffering from pneumonia and other problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister failed to look at the issue of the private <i>versus</i> public mix in public hospitals except to load some of the burden of the public health services on to private health insurers. The symptoms are everywhere, including weak management and lack of leadership. For example, one of the major hospitals required an MRI scan at a cost of approximately £1 million. The Department allowed the Southern Health Board to enable consultants employed by the board set up a private business, a limited company, and to use the facility as a profit making venture. The board then stated that there was a ration on public patients using the facility in a public hospital. There is something fundamentally wrong in a system that allows things like that to happen. It meant that a public patient had to wait two years for an MRI scan in a public hospital, a scan owned and operated by a private company in a public hospital. By contrast, a private patient could have access to it in two months or less.</P>
      <P>With the departure of Deputy Cowen, there is now a three-tier health system, consisting of the public patient, the private patient who has limited VHI or BUPA insurance who would get access to a public hospital, and those who are highly insured with ready access to the private hospitals. There has been scant regard given also to two areas, to which I will devote some of my time, which are not mentioned at all because they are not high profile areas in the health services, one of which is the psychiatric services. There are too many facilities around the country that are Dickensian, that have lacked any investment programme and are showing their age. The system developed in the 1980s drove people out of psychiatric hospitals into the communities, people who were ill-equipped, and who did not have the back-up facilities. Often many of those people ended up homeless on our streets. Not all the homeless are psychiatric patients but many of them ended up homeless on the streets and were condemned to local authority flats in areas with no social services, with all the consequences of that. That issue has not been addressed and there is a need for a new Minister. I congratulate my colleague from Cork, Deputy Micheál Martin, on becoming the Minister for Health and Children. He has an opportunity to deal with areas in real need of reform, such as the care of the psychiatric patients. I cannot go into detail on it in the limited time I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On care for the elderly, an indication of the <Col N="499" /> Minister's failure is that an allocation was not made in 1999 for day-care centres for the elderly. The Minister failed to make an allocation available up to January of this year. I was informed by a senior official in a health board that the health board had not received a memorandum or communication from the Minister for Health and Children relating to capital funding for day-care centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to last year &ndash; 1999. There was not any communication to the health boards to whom I spoke. That shows the type of priority given. The Minister has not dealt with the whole issue of nursing homes and the subventions for nursing homes. The level of subventions have not changed for years. Families are now forced to sell the family home in order to get the father or mother cared for. The elderly are being told to sell their homes to get a place in a nursing home. The health boards are being forced to tell them that because of the inadequate level of subvention, over which the Minister presides. The Minister is great at announcing big figures but it is like pouring water into a leaking bucket with the inefficiencies, lack of policies and the lack of reform. There is huge wastage in that area and the Minister addressed that situation in a very ineffective way.</P>
      <P>The issue of medical manpower has not been addressed. In a reply to a parliamentary question which I received yesterday, the Minister was hanging his hat on a report that was due from a study group.</P>

      <P>I have limited time but I will address two other issues. Fianna Fáil has 11 Deputies in Cork city and county, and neither they nor the Minister have done anything about the closure of RTE Cork, which has provided a top class public service to the people of Cork city and county and even South Kerry over the past 25 years. An effort has not been made to reverse the decision made by the RTE authority to close down that station. Even at this stage, on the eve of closure, the Minister and the 11 Fianna Fáil Deputies should stand their ground on this issue and make sure that the service which has been valid and valuable to the people of the south western region is allowed continue. We should not fall victim to the battle of the jingle on the airwaves.</P>

      <P>The wedding party or Mafia wedding group arrived in Cork last Tuesday.

      <P>If the new Minister for Foreign Affairs is offering me seven minutes, the staff of the House should not be churlish. I am truly sorry about the departure, and the manner of the departure, of my constituency colleague Deputy Chris Flood, who has been a committed Minister and an honourable constituency colleague. I know that he has never been afraid to take a principled and decent stand on awkward issues in the constituency and I particularly recall some very contentious issues in the area of traveller accommodation. He had a great feel for the job of Minister. The drugs strategy and the local drugs task forces have made a tremendous contribution, albeit having been implemented 20 years too late when the problem had been allowed to take root. I am sorry to see him go and I also fear that it might mean that Fianna Fáil will return to taking both sides of the road with them in the constituency, which I would regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> I also want to be associated with the many tributes which have been paid to Deputy Andrews. He was, perhaps, the most laid-back Member of the House but was a man always motivated by decent considerations. I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>Of all the Ministers of State that might have retired, Deputy Flood would be the last person I would have chosen. There are a number of anonymous under-performers and under-achievers on the second bench of Ministers. I would have thought the Taoiseach would have availed of the opportunity for a more radical shake up.</P>
    <P>Ever since Deputy Andrews announced his decision, wherever more than two or three people met around the country and asked who has the natural skills, diplomacy and track record to take over at Iveagh House, they automatically said Deputy Cowen. Asking Deputy Cowen to take over the diplomatic service is like asking Mike Tyson to stand in for Michael Flatley in &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo;. He knows, of course, I do not mean that. Deputy Cowen is a man of considerable ability. He has not been a good Minister for Health and Children but he has the intellectual ability and commitment to politics to be a good Minister for Foreign Affairs and I wish him well. I also wish the Minister, Deputy Fahey, well. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has at some length paid tribute to his skill as a politician. Former Deputy, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn can certainly acknowledge this and the manner in which he successfully undermined her in Galway west is a tribute to that skill and tenacity. If he demonstrates that skill in the Cabinet he will do a good job in his Department.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Eoin Ryan well. He is entitled to his chance, but I would have preferred if he had been given another portfolio. It is difficult to understand the job being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, when one comes from the leafy suburbs of Dublin 4. However, I wish him well, as I do his colleague, Deputy Hanafin.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity for a more wide-ranging and radical reshuffle. If there are a number of anonymous under-performers among the Ministers of State, there are a number of very weary performers at Cabinet level. Members of the House &ndash; this is something we share with the media &ndash; live a relatively comfortable middle class existence. However, that is not how society is organised. The gulf between those with a relatively comfortable existence and others in society is widening, which is evident when one considers the functions of the Department of Health and Children. The injustice and inequality in terms of access to health care, notwithstanding the additional moneys which have been invested, are still acute.</P>
    <P>Nobody has referred to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Quite properly my colleague, Deputy Quinn, referred <Col N="502" /> to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, remaining in his post and the fact that the Taoiseach must have something against him. There has been a 62% increase in the price of houses since the Government took office while the number on the housing list has doubled to almost 50,000 people. The recommendations in the Bacon report are not working as the figures for last year show house price increases of 21% while rents in the private sector have almost doubled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I do not have more time as I would like to have discussed a number of policy areas. The calculated decision in the budget to widen the gap between those on lower and no incomes other than State support and everybody else is regrettable. I am very surprised the Taoiseach permitted this as he is renowned for staying in touch with the ordinary person. We in this House are losing touch with the ordinary person who is not enjoying the benefits of the economic boom in the way rhetoric in the House seems to suggest. They cannot get access to a hospital bed, affording a house is beyond their wildest dreams, neither can they get a public house. In my local authority area there are 2,780 on the housing list according to the latest calculation while we have permission to build 1,000 houses over four years, that is 250 houses per annum.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley made a good point when he said we should not confuse living standards with quality of life. We are confusing these and I do not think the new team put together by the Taoiseach shows any more commitment to understanding and redressing this than the old team. There is a crisis in terms of housing while the more money we invest in health services the more endemic the problems seem to become. There must be serious management problems in the health sector. Why is the problem getting worse while investment is exponentially rising? These are fundamental questions which no doubt we will return to during the life of the Government.</P>

      <P>My primary reason for contributing to the debate is to pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. However, it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to say what a pleasure it was to know a man of the calibre of Deputy Andrews. He was committed, honourable and a man of substance. I congratulate my colleagues, particularly Deputy Eoin Ryan who will shortly be joining my Department, Deputy Hanafin and the new Mini<Col N="503" /> ster, Deputy Fahey. I have no doubt about the capabilities of Deputies Cowen, Martin and Woods in their new portfolios.</P>
      <P>It was with great sadness that I learned of the decision of Deputy Flood to resign from his post as Minister of State at my Department. It has been a great pleasure to work with Deputy Flood over the past two and a half years. He has made a very significant contribution to the Government's policy on social inclusion, particularly in the area of greatest disadvantage. He has impressed all who worked with him with his deep personal commitment to his portfolio. He has never swayed from taking a strong personal stand on difficult and unpopular issues.</P>
      <P>His contribution to local development and tackling the scourge of drug abuse is widely acknowledged and appreciated by the voluntary and community sectors, particularly by those working with the local drugs task forces and in partnership areas. When Deputy Flood took responsibility for this area residents' associations were taking to the streets of our major cities and towns. To his credit that is no longer the case. In terms of drug abuse he has been particularly successful in increasing the resources available to the local drugs task forces and has put in place a facilities and services fund for young people amounting to £35 million which provides much needed facilities and services in our most deprived areas. He has overseen the implementation of the integrated services process in four areas of intense urban disadvantage and has taken a very keen personal interest in its progress. This project reflects his own strong belief in the need for a much improved and more focused response by State agencies at local level in our worst urban blackspots and in the involvement of local people in tackling problems in their areas. He has been instrumental in ensuring the success of the Operational Programme for Urban Initiative which is designed to tackle urban issues in an integrated manner through supporting business creation and improving infrastructure and the physical environment in the three selected urban areas.</P>
      <P>Of late there has been discussion about the £280 million funding for vital sporting infrastructure which we recently announced. Deputy Flood has secured a budget of £420 million under the national development plan for social inclusion measures to operate through the area based partnerships and the local drugs task force areas. He has worked closely with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in putting in place arrangements for the closer integration of local development with local government. This will ensure the long-term future of a range of supports for local communities to help them break the cycle of deprivation and lay foundations for the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flood has discharged his responsibility in a quiet, unassuming manner and as a result <Col N="504" /> may not have received the recognition he deserves for the very important contribution he has made in his area of responsibility. He is one of those people who represent what is best in our democratic process. He beavers away behind the scenes, bringing about real change, while not seeking the limelight for himself. He has a deep and abiding commitment to public service and has served his constituents in Dublin South-West and his country in a caring and compassionate way.</P>

      <P>I also wish to pay tribute to Deputy Flood, my constituency and party colleague since I became a Member of the House. Normally there is great tension between party colleagues in constituencies, but Deputy Flood and I got on famously. We never had a row. He was very welcoming when it was first mooted that I should be brought into the constituency and he very much smoothed the path for my arrival in Leinster House, and I pay tribute to him for that. He did not blow his trumpet as loudly as others in politics but he achieved a great deal, particularly in combating the drugs menace. He has played a huge and pivotal role in re-establishing order and restoring confidence in communities, which protested at the lack of action in regard to the drugs problem. Deputy Flood has turned that around and he can be very proud. I pay tribute to my colleague who will be a great loss to the constituency, but I am sure he will also greatly contribute to Fianna Fáil securing two seats there in the next general election.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I listened to Deputy Bruton's contribution before I had to leave the House in order to launch the Forfás 2010 strategy and I could not help but reflect on how similar his comments have been of late to those of Deputy Joe Higgins. I do not know whether he has found a new script writer or whether his own thinking has radically changed but I found the gloom, doom and pessimism of the Deputy's comments hard to believe at a time when unemployment has reduced from 17% to 5%, long-term unemployment is down to 2%, there is net immigration, high growth rates and Ireland attracts 27% of all the mobile investment coming from the US into Europe even though it has less than 1% of the European population. It was reminiscent of 20 years ago and that is a great pity.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a number of comments about those who are standing down before I speak about the new ministerial appointments. Deputy Andrews has been a Member of the House since 1965 and has been elected in 11 successive general elections. He is a man of enormous integrity. He is a progressive politician and has shown great courage during his political career. His father, Todd Andrews, played a very important role in developing the semi-State sector and it must have been a great honour for him to see two of his sons elected to Dáil Éireann. In last year's local elections, two of his grandsons, Barry and Chris, were elected to local authorities. The Andrews family has given three generations of service to the country.</P>
      <P>I have known Deputy Andrews well since I entered Leinster House in 1977. When people stand down, nice comments are made about them, particularly when they do so of their own accord. Throughout the time I have known him he has always been a great colleague. He is a decent, honest, hard working person. My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, who has worked closely with him over recent years as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs summed him up last Saturday when she said that he is not territorial, does not want to do everything and likes to work with people and give them the opportunity to contribute. She also said that he finds it easy to work with women, and that cannot be said of every male politician here and elsewhere. I wish him, his wife Annette and his family every success in the future. He will be with us in the House until the next general election.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flood has been a constituency colleague for a considerable time. He is in every sense a decent person. The comments of Opposition Members and Deputy Lenihan are true. He is understated and does not crave the media. Our constituency has high profile, middle profile and low profile individuals. Deputy Flood is a solid performer and has a passionate interest in the concerns of the less well off in our society and in community development. He worked with great vigour to deal with the drugs crisis that exists in many communities. Anyone I have met who has worked with him in recent years, whether in public administration or at community level, has had nothing but positive comments to make about his performance, effort and concern.</P>
      <P>It is sad that he must bring his ministerial and, indeed, political career to an end at the next general election for health reasons. He is young and all of us wish him well over the next number of years. He has had a difficult time in the past and I thank him and his wife, Carmel, for their support. He has been a loyal and decent colleague and, as Deputy Rabbitte said, he never sought to win support at the expense not just of people in his own party but those in other parties also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen is being promoted to the Department of Foreign Affairs. He is one of the most able people to have served in ministerial office. I am amused when I read that there is sup<Col N="506" /> posed to be a certain formula if one wishes to become Minister for Foreign Affairs. The world of diplomacy does not operate on the basis that everybody smiles at everybody else, that one just tells people what they want to hear or one goes about one's business in a particular way. We should be mature enough in this House to know what is required to be a Minister in any Department. Deputy Cowen is tough, decisive, has his own views and is not afraid to outline them. That is much more important in ministerial office than some of the qualities that are perceived by others as being necessary. We will soon get to a stage where if one is not a certain size or does not look a certain way, one will not be able to serve in the House.</P>

      <P>I hope we do not arrive at that juncture. This is a republic, which is about treating everybody equally and with respect.</P>
      <P>We are at a difficult stage in the Northern Ireland peace process. We require most of all somebody with the skills which Deputy Cowen has to take this process forward. An enormous effort has gone into it over recent years and I believe that he is the right person to take up that post to negotiate on our behalf with our counterparts in Europe and around the world. We will be proud of him internationally as he seeks to represent Ireland in the international field.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods is a man of enormous experience having served in several different Ministries. He has held office constantly since the late 1970s when his party has been in power and that speaks volumes for the type of person he is. He is extremely loyal, hard working and bright. I have no doubt that he will be a great Minister for Education and Science as he has a keen interest in education and research.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin has been one of the most dynamic and energetic Ministers for Education ever and I have no doubt that he will bring that energy and dynamism to the Department of Health and Children and will do a good job. Deputy Fahey has been appointed as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. He has a proven track record and displayed many skills in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in regard to the needs of children in our society. He put in an enormous effort in that regard. He is moving to a different area but he will do an outstanding job and I congratulate him and wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a coalition Government. Such Governments function on the basis of co-operation, not confrontation. The Government works extremely well and the Taoiseach goes out of this way to make sure that he works well with his colleagues. The Government is all the stronger for that. Bookmakers are giving odds of 4/1 that the Government will be re-elected. Opposition Members should place a few bets at that price <Col N="507" /> before the odds shorten because this Government is the first since 1969 to have a real chance of re-election. We work together in the interests of the country and have had remarkable success in a short time. We have almost two and a half years to fully implement our programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The changes made by the Taoiseach are appropriate as I do not believe in change for the sake of change. I note that others said that he should have taken the opportunity for more widespread change. I do not agree that one must move people around just for the sake of it, so that, in some sense, it might look good. There are people who, in their ministerial positions, are very involved in various projects that take some time to bring to fruition. Moving people for the sake of it does not achieve anything. It takes time for people to get a handle <Col N="508" /> on a new area. The Taoiseach has got it right. I look forward to continuing to work with all my colleagues in their respective roles.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hanafin and Ryan bring a fresh new impetus to the Government. They are both young. I hate to say I worked with their fathers as it makes me sound ancient but I did. Both their fathers were in the Seanad when I came in here in 1977 and I have known both of them for a long time. They are bright, able, talented people and will be an enormous asset to the Government's ministerial team. I congratulate them and wish them well.  </P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today has three separate strands to it. These are, first, the enactment of a new legislative regime to regulate marine casualty investigation in Ireland; second, provision for an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, to enable the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to provide a legislative framework to regulate the use of pleasure craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, in Ireland; and, third, provision for a technical amendment to the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which provides clarification on the definition of maritime casualties in that Act.</P>
    <P>I intend dealing with each strand separately. The first of these will see a major improvement in the law governing the investigation of marine casualties in Ireland. To this end, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative regime to regulate the entire area of maritime casualty investigation to replace the current statutory system which was established over a century ago in the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.</P>
    <P>Specifically it will establish an independent marine casualty board with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and provide for procedural aspects relating to the operation of the board; place a requirement on owners, charterers, masters and other specified people to report the occurrence of a marine casualty; provide for the appointment of marine casualty investigators with statutory powers by the board to investigate marine casualties in Irish waters, and indeed marine casualties involving Irish vessels wherever they occur, establish the cause of the casualty and make recommendations on the avoidance of similar casualties; ensure that all reports into casualties will be published within a specified timeframe &ndash; normally within nine months from the occurrence of the marine casualty; provide for the establishment, where necessary and following consultation with the board, of a tribunal of inquiry into a marine casualty; and provide powers to allow the testing for intoxicants in the aftermath of a marine casualty.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I have travelled to coastal communities throughout the country and, in doing so, I have become keenly aware of the attachment of <Col N="511" /> these communities to their maritime traditions and the part the sea plays in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, I am only too well aware that the maritime area can sometimes be a dangerous one, and the investigation of accidents is an important need which must have regard to delicate and highly sensitive issues from the human, legal and technical perspectives.</P>
    <P>For some time now, I have been very much aware of the concerns which are held not just by coastal communities but by the entire maritime community and the public in general, with regard to the way in which marine accidents are investigated by my Department. Indeed, it was back in 1992 when I, as Minister for the Marine, first identified the major gap which existed between what the current system provides and what the public expects, particularly when it comes to the publication of reports. It was clear to me then that in line with changes in public values and the trend towards more open government, the old system of casualty investigation, with inquiries behind closed doors and non-publication of reports, was no longer acceptable. Experience since then has shown that an enhanced statutory basis is essential to ensure fair and timely publication of casualty reports.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory basis for investigating marine casualties is contained in the relevant provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. While this Act allows for the appointment of a person to carry out an investigation and to report to me, as Minister, on the findings of the investigation, it does not provide a statutory requirement for a report of the investigation to be published.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, my Department has, at my request, been conducting investigations into marine accidents in a more open way. This was designed in the interests of maritime safety and in order to allay public concerns about such incidents. However, difficulties remain regarding the publication of reports, and progress in having marine casualty reports published has been slower than I would like. I am particularly aware of the disappointment and upset which bereaved families have experienced as a result of the delays which are occurring in the publication of reports and I fully appreciate that these delays are a cause of great concern to them. In November 1996, a review group was established by my Department to examine the existing policy, procedures and legislative framework for maritime casualty investigation in Ireland and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The group was chaired by Mr. Vincent Power, solicitor and partner in A. &amp; L. Goodbody, solicitors, and the membership included representatives of my Department, including the Marine Survey Office and the Irish Marine Emergency Service, as well as people with relevant knowledge and experience in accident investigation and from the legal and maritime professions. The policy aim underpinning the review was to put in <Col N="512" /> place a modern casualty investigation system for Ireland, in accordance with highest international practice, which would provide greater clarity as to when such investigations should be held, how they should be conducted and what their role and scope should be. It was also intended that the policy would meet the needs and expectations of the various interested parties in relation to casualty investigations.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this review group was an expression of the importance which we in the Department attach to tackling this issue. The task set for the review group was nothing less than a fundamental overhaul of the Irish marine casualty investigation system and it was considered essential that the task receive the fullest and most comprehensive consideration. Moreover, the task presented to the group proved to be more onerous than first thought and the issues involved for consideration proved to be extremely complex, varied and sensitive.</P>
    <P>Apart from holding its own meetings, the group met with around 50 interested parties including representatives of various bereaved families, interested organisations and relevant Government agencies in Ireland and abroad. The group also examined the marine casualty investigation systems in various other countries, most notably those in Europe and in Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand. The review group examined the problems encountered in carrying out previous casualty investigations, and lessons learned, with a view to ensuring that the Department's procedures, particularly those concerning communication with bereaved families, the industry, media and other State agencies, should become more sensitive, clear and useful.</P>
    <P>The policy review group submitted a detailed report of its deliberations to me in June 1998 and I published the report in September of that year. In its report, the review group has made 39 recommendations to improve the system of casualty investigations in Ireland. Key recommendations included were the establishment of an independent marine casualty investigation board with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties; the enactment of a new legislative and procedural regime to regulate the entire area of marine casualty investigation to replace the system established in 1894; a specific timetable should be laid down for the investigation and publication processes; all reports into casualties should be published; the purpose of marine casualty investigation is to determine the cause of the casualty in an attempt to ensure that similar occurrences do not recur and the purpose of the investigation should not be to foster recrimination or apportion blame.</P>
    <P>As a result of the group's work we now have a great opportunity to design a top class investigation system for Ireland in accordance with the highest international practice which will be conducted in compliance with the more open approach I envisaged back in 1992. I am confident that we have identified a new system of <Col N="513" /> investigation which will resolve the current difficulties regarding the publication of reports and raising of expectations, as well as legal difficulties about whether reports can be published.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I now consider that there is an urgent need to establish the marine casualty investigation board as part of my strategy to enhance safety standards throughout the seafaring community. The number of tragedies in recent years, particularly involving fishing vessels, is a major concern and it is important that the causes of any such future tragedy be determined and a report published quickly, so that the lessons to be learned will have maximum effect.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the enactment by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources of the new legislative and procedural regime to regulate the entire area of marine casualty investigation to replace the system established in 1894, over 100 years ago. I am confident that this new system should ensure that it will be clear to all what types of casualties will be investigated, when an investigation is necessary, who will conduct it and that a report of the investigation will be published within a specified time frame. In overall safety terms, it should mean that lessons learned from the investigation of a casualty will be disseminated more quickly and the needs of all interested parties will also be met without unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to deal with the main provisions in the Bill. First and foremost, the Bill provides for the establishment of an independent marine casualty investigation board comprising three people appointed by me, as Minister, as well as the chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office and the Secretary General of the Department, or his or her nominee, in total a board of five people. The board will, therefore, have a majority of members from outside the Department and the Bill requires that the chairperson and deputy chairperson are appointed by the Minister from the three members appointed from outside. The model for the composition and independence of the board follows the recommendation of the policy review group which came to the conclusion, in the Irish context, that it was neither practical nor appropriate to establish a system whereby investigators and surveyors would be entirely separate from the Department. While I agree that it is necessary to draw on existing experience of marine casualty investigation in the Department, the Bill also makes provision for the engagement by the board of consultants, advisers and investigators for marine casualties as necessary. I am satisfied that through this measure the board will be in a position to ensure that the proper expertise will be available and will be utilised by the board when investigating casualties where particular circumstances would warrant such consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the investigation of marine casualties by the marine casualty investigation board and for the appointment of investigators by <Col N="514" /> the board to undertake investigations of marine casualties on its behalf. The Bill also gives investigators specific powers to conduct investigations and provides penalties for persons who fail to provide information or records to the investigator. A feature of the Bill is the provision of specific powers for investigators to detain vessels, and crew members of vessels, involved in a marine casualty for the purpose of investigating the casualty. It also provides for crew members on board a vessel involved in a marine casualty incident to be tested for the presence of alcohol or drugs. While such powers were not previously available under the regulatory regime for marine casualty investigation in this country, they are fair, reasonable and necessary to allow the investigators carry out their functions in an efficient and comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>The policy review group strongly indicated in its report that the sole purpose of marine casualty investigations should be to determine the cause of the casualty so as to help prevent the occurrence of similar casualties. The group further recommended that the purpose of an investigation would not be to apportion blame or liability and this is reflected in the provisions of the Bill. In this regard, I accept the group's recommendation that marine casualty investigators should investigate the facts of a marine casualty and let others, such as the courts or disciplinary tribunals, establish blame and sanction fault where appropriate.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements of casualty investigation is the need for the relevant authorities to be notified as soon as possible of such casualties when they occur. The Bill provides clear rules on when, to whom and by whom casualties should be reported and sets out requirements on owners, masters and other specified persons to report the occurrence of a marine casualty immediately they are aware that a marine casualty has occurred, or as soon as is practical thereafter. This will enable the investigation board to commence its inquiries without any unnecessary delay and will improve the efficiency of an investigation as investigators will be able to set about gathering evidence while it is still fresh and available.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in clearly set terms for the publication of reports into marine casualties. In particular, it sets out a statutory target of nine months from the reporting of a casualty for the publication of a report and that a report should contain all relevant findings of the investigation, indicate the causes or probable causes, if established, of the marine casualty and outline any recommendations that the board considers to be warranted and feasible to avoid similar marine casualties. It also makes provision for the publication of interim reports where a report cannot be completed within the nine months or at any time that the board considers it expedient. I am generally very pleased with the timeframes for publication which are specified in the Bill and this will lead to a huge improvement over the current <Col N="515" /> situations where it can take a number of years before a report into a casualty is published. This situation is unacceptable to me as I am sure it is to many of those whose lives and families have been touched by marine tragedies and who have had their pain compounded by delays in learning of the circumstances of such tragedies. The completion of an investigation and publication of a report in as short a time as possible will play a vital role in meeting the needs of all those with an interest in an investigation and in the wider sense will help to instil greater public confidence in the overall investigation process.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months or so, I have published a number of important reports of marine casualty investigations. In doing so, my Department has complied with the principles of natural justice whereby any person whose reputation might be affected by issues raised in a report has been given an opportunity in advance of publication to address these issues and to have their comments included in the published report. These natural justice procedures are very much strengthened in the Bill which provides that such people should be given confidential sight of the draft report and a right of reply to be included in an appendix to the published report if that person so wishes.</P>
    <P>I have published a number of reports into marine casualties in the past 18 months or so. These included: a report of the investigation into the loss of the fishing vessel <i>Carrickatine </i>with a crew of six people on 15 November 1995; a report of the investigation into the loss of the fishing vessel <i>Jenalisa </i>with a crew of three people on 4 February 1996; a report of the investigation into the loss of the fishing vessel <i>Scarlet Buccaneer </i>at Howth, County Dublin, on 16 November 1995; a report of the investigation into the capsize of the harbour tug/workboat <i>New Ross One </i>on 8 August 1995; and a report of the investigation into the collision between the French fishing vessel <i>Agena </i>and the Irish fishing vessel <i>Orchidee </i>on 22 September 1992.</P>
    <P>A number of investigations are ongoing in my Department and a number of other reports are being processed for publication in consultation with the Attorney General's office. I am anxious that work will continue to have these reports published as soon as possible. The Bill provides for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board to complete any investigations which are outstanding at the time that the board may be established. This will ensure not only that reports of these investigations will be published as promised but also that there will not be any gaps in terms of publication between the system now in place and the new regulatory system which will replace it.</P>
    <P>The second major element of the Bill is the provision for an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, to enable the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to provide a legislative framework to regulate the use of pleasure craft in Ireland, including jet skis and fast power craft, as recommended in the interim report of <Col N="516" /> the action group on small powered recreational craft which I published recently.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, enables the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources by way of regulations, to make provisions for the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants and it was under this section that I introduced the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992, to enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to propose to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources that areas within, or in the seas adjoining, their jurisdiction be designated as unsuitable for the operation of these craft in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
    <P>However, because of the limitations in the provisions of the 1992 Merchant Shipping Act, the measures are only available for the protection of pleasure craft and their occupants and do not extend to the protection of swimmers, bathers or the natural environment as these matters would be beyond the scope of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources' statutory powers.</P>
    <P>To date, three areas have been designated under the 1992 regulations. These are Lough Carra, County Mayo, Lough Owel, County Westmeath and Carlingford Harbour, County Louth. A number of other proposals have been received for consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>While the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992, were introduced to prevent these craft operating in certain areas, difficulties arose concerning the implementation of these regulations and the Office of the Attorney General has advised that they are now considered to be legally unsound and do not provide the scope of what most local authorities proposals seek to achieve. As a result, further processing of designation proposals had to be suspended by my Department.</P>
    <P>Since returning to office as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in 1997, I have been very conscious of the widespread concerns being expressed by many people about the safe use of recreational craft for personal purposes and in particular the reports of indiscriminate and irresponsible use of jet skis and fast power craft by a small number of individuals.</P>
    <P>Some limited action had been taken on a number of fronts to address these widespread concerns, including good work on zoning undertaken by a number of coastal local authorities, namely Galway, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. However, in view of the growing public concern I took the initiative in August 1999 to establish a broadly representative action group to address this important matter, especially in the light of a number of recent serious accidents, and fatalities, involving jet skis and fast craft. Furthermore, following the recent tragedy off Dunany Point, County Louth, where four people, including two children, tragically lost their lives, I secured Cabinet approval to include the drawing up of a safety <Col N="517" /> policy for small powered leisure craft within the terms of reference of the action group.</P>
    <P>My central aim in setting up this action group is to put in place policies and practical measures to protect the safety of all water users in the context of a comprehensive safety regime for recreational craft generally. My basic aim in relation to fast water craft and jet skis is to stop irresponsible behaviour by a small number of users, to protect the safety of other water users and to end the reported severe nuisance and distress being caused in certain locations and in traditional bathing, boating and angling areas. I have asked the action group to carry out a comprehensive review of the safe use of personal recreational water craft and to consider measures which will be effective, sensible an enforceable and will be instrumental in introducing a shift in the culture towards safety as the overriding consideration.</P>
    <P>I have outlined to the group that I envisage a new safety regime imposing strict controls on fast water craft which would include a requirement on training and operator competence testing, operator licences and craft registration. As regards other recreational craft, I have urged the group to address urgently and imaginatively how we can ensure that children in particular are adequately safeguarded in the event of a vessel capsize or other accidents. Wearing suitable lifejackets or buoyancy aids is of central importance as is the need to get the safety message across to such craft users, particularly in terms of competence in the use of such craft and an understanding of risk to themselves and others.</P>
    <P>The action group, in its deliberations, has particular regard to the Marine Institute's current study on safety policy in the marine leisure sector, the good work on zoning undertaken by a number of coastal local authorities and best practice and ideas in place and being developed internationally to ensure that all water users can enjoy their activities in safety. An important series of seminars on personal recreational watercraft and on commercial craft used in the marine tourism and leisure sector was organised late last year by the Marine Institute as part of its study of the existing safety regime for the marine leisure industry. These proved to be timely and relevant as they played an important role as an initial phase in the consultative process being undertaken by the action group on small powered recreational craft. This consultative process will form a key element in the work of the action group and has been vital in ensuring that a broad spectrum of views from interested parties can be gathered to enable the informing of a genuine safety policy with regard to personal recreational watercraft.</P>
    <P>Members of the action group were present at each of the seminars and they participated actively in making them a success. I am sure the views they heard and the knowledge of the sector they gained has helped them enormously in their deliberations. When I established the action group, I asked the chairman to provide me with <Col N="518" /> an interim report by the middle of November 1999. The group completed its initial review of the issues posed specifically by the use of personal water craft &ndash; jet skis &ndash; and fast power craft in Ireland as an initial step. The interim report of the action group was presented to me on schedule.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust and content of the interim report and in particular the conclusion that there is a strong case, first, to support and extend, as the primary public policy response to these issues, the use of local by-laws to regulate the use of jet skis and fast power craft; second, to construct a complementary national system to put in place a range of conditions governing the use of such craft, applicable to all locations and circumstances and, third, to put in place measures and capacities which will persuade or allow users of such craft to attain the levels of competence and training necessary to deliver responsible use of such craft. I have also accepted the group's recommendation that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources should provide a legislative framework to allow for the enactment by local authorities of the necessary by-laws to govern the use of jet skis and fast power craft and to provide in regulations a set of uniform conditions to be applied nationally to all users of such craft in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has been my clearly stated intention to move quickly, on foot of this interim report, to provide the comprehensive legislative framework recommended in order that I may address the problems which have been identified. I am satisfied that this proposed legislative framework and subsequent regulations will redress the deficiencies identified in existing law and provide an effective set of conditions to regulate the use of jet skis and fast craft in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, provided for in the Bill has been designed to provide the legislative framework as recommended by the action group and, as a result, the Minister will be empowered to regulate for the safety of pleasure craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, their occupants and, most significantly, other persons and property from injury or damage caused by or resulting from the use of pleasure craft. The amendment in the Bill also enables the Minister to provide local authorities and bodies with the power to introduce by-laws to control the use of such craft in areas under their jurisdiction and to appoint authorised officers for the purpose of enforcing these by-laws.</P>
    <P>In the wider context I note with great interest the action group's agreement on the paramount need to ensure the safety on the water of children and young people, particularly as they are becoming more and more involved in water based activities. I particularly welcome the recommendations it has made in relation to the wearing of appropriate lifejackets, the minimum age under which they should not be allowed to operate fast craft <Col N="519" /> and the need to view this in the context of an overall appreciation of water safety.</P>
    <P>The action group still has much work to do in order to complete its task, not least to address the issues which have been raised and to draw up the parameters of an appropriate policy in the areas of regulation, culture change, safety awareness, education and training. I also accept the group's view that the legislative framework it has proposed currently represents only an initial step in the process. I share the view that the legislation proposed for enactment, both at local and national level, should be the subject of a further partnership consultative process in regard to its design, implementation and local management.</P>
    <P>While the final report of the action group is not due until the end of February, the legislative framework now proposed will enable the Minister to act quickly on whatever further regulatory recommendations are made by the group. We all have a joint interest in developing and promoting the safe use of the marine and inland waterway resources in Ireland. In particular, we each owe a duty of care to ensure that our waters are made safe for the enjoyment of all. We must continue to work together to achieve the highest safety standards possible. I expect the action group to proceed with its deliberations and to deliver its final report in February 2000.</P>
    <P>The third and smallest strand of the Bill is the inclusion of an amendment to the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which provides clarification on the definition of maritime casualties in that Act. This technical amendment has been included on the advice of the Attorney General to reflect greater clarity in the legal drafting of this definition and does not materially alter the substance of the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>This legislation is vital, first, to establish a new, open and more modern legislative regime to regulate the entire area of marine casualty investigation in Ireland as we enter the new millennium and, second, to enact the legislative framework which will allow for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, as the appropriate national authority, to make provisions for the purpose of ensuring the safety of all recreational craft, the occupants of recreational craft and any other persons or property from injury, damage and disturbance arising out of the use of recreational craft, with the emphasis on personal watercraft and fast power craft in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to thank Deputies Finucane and Bell for their constructive and searching contributions and support during my term of office as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. We have managed to achieve a great deal in the House. Those achievements are the result of both the ideas raised by the Opposition spokesmen and their co-operation. They made it possible to get many measures through the House and implemented at an early stage. I also thank the people in the marine indus<Col N="520" /> try, BIM, the Marine Institute and the Central Fisheries Board for their co-operation. I hope it has been a productive period and I welcome the support they gave me. I particularly thank the chairpersons of the relevant boards.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind comments. I compliment him and wish him well in his new brief. Over the years, as is inevitable in this House, there has been a certain amount of confrontation. However, I believe this Department was always dealt with constructively by all sides. We endeavoured to do what we believed was best for the industry which expects us to act on its behalf. The marine industry would have welcomed it if the Minister had remained in the Department because there is a feeling in that sector that the industry is not treated as seriously by Governments as it should. Sometimes it is regarded as the Cinderella industry. Had he remained in the brief, the Minister might have dispensed with that notion. However, he is moving on to pastures new and we wish him well. I hope both Deputy Bell and I on the Opposition benches will continue to represent the industry as best we can.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation to regulate the area of marine casualty investigation. The current system has been in place for over 100 years, since 1894. The legislation is timely and the recent accident between two fishing vessels about 80 miles off the Aran Islands helped us to focus on potential hazards at sea and the necessity for legislation of this nature. Fortunately, no lives were lost. However, according to a press statement issued by the Minister's Department on Saturday, 22 January, there was a potential risk to the coastline with about 34,000 gallons of intermediate oil spilt into the sea. On Sunday a further release from the Minister's Department estimated that about 500 gallons was involved in the spillage. There is a serious conflict between both sets of information and the Department should explain how this could be the case. Fortunately, because of favourable winds, it appears at this stage that the oil will not finish up on our coastline. We are fortunate that this appears to be the case. Recent television pictures of the scenes in Brittany showed the havoc which can be caused by an oil spillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having received such a warning, it behoves the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Environment and Local Government to ensure proper protection measures for our coastline. It also lends a sense of urgency for the Government to purchase a tug boat to deal with sea pollution, especially where oil is involved. I am aware a comprehensive document was produced recently and is being considered by the Irish Marine Emergency Service, which I believe has been rechristened the Coastguard Service, a more suitable name consistent with other countries which have coastguard services. It is important for the Department to move swiftly and purchase a tug boat. The accident off <Col N="521" /> the Aran Islands was a warning shot. With busy shipping lanes, it is inevitable that something will go wrong at some stage. It would take many years to recover from the damage which would be done to our coastlines and ecology by an oil spillage. We should be prepared.</P>
    <P>It is worth bearing in mind that, although a great deal of attention is focused on incidents involving commercial fishing craft, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution statistics show that, of all call-outs answered by voluntary lifeboat crews, about 45% were for pleasure craft. While this legislation addresses the process of marine casualty investigation, the emphasis must be on safety. Therefore, statutory regulation is required for pleasure craft and jet skis. The Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, and it is important that these regulations are in place as soon as possible. The current regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act for jet skis and fast power boats have been found to be seriously deficient and in need of amendment.</P>
    <P>Recently, possibly as a result of our increased prosperity, jet skis and power boats have become more popular. Jet skis are as dangerous as a powerful 1200cc motorbike, yet no licence, insurance or experience is required for these jet skis which are capable of speeds up to 50 miles per hour. There is concern in this regard in the UK where up to seven deaths have occurred in four years. The British Government intends to ensure that powers are given to local authorities to control the use of jet skis where necessary. While one council in Ireland, Fingal County Council, has taken the initiative on the control of jet skis in its area, it is imperative that the Minister sets out strict regulations on how, when, where and by whom jet skis can be sold.</P>
    <P>It should not be left solely to local authorities to implement the regulations. The Minister's Department must ensure that fines and custodial sentences for breaches of the regulations are in place. Already, many Mediterranean countries with more sunshine and favourable weather conditions have been licensing, registering and even banning the use of jet skis. Jet skis conjure up images of excitement. Perhaps if they were called nautical motorbikes, which is what they are, it might conjure up more images of risk and the inherent safety factors involved. There is almost a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to safety.</P>
    <P>With the Celtic tiger creating a great deal of wealth, people are buying power boats, some of them with up to 200 horse power engines and capable of speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. In unfavourable weather conditions with choppy waters, they are likely to capsize. We were reminded of that by the recent tragedy in Cork where two people lost their lives when they went out in a power boat for the first time. If we want to focus on the safety aspect, we can reflect on the loss of life in Ireland in recent years, not only to jet skis but also to power boats. Some Irish tourists in continental destinations used jet skis and tragically lost their lives. Many people using <Col N="522" /> water craft do not even wear life jackets. While they may show scant respect for their safety, they also show little respect for others in the area, such as swimmers. Considering that from £4,000 to £10,000 may be paid for a jet ski or a power boat, it is sad to think that a person will not pay between £60 and £70 for a power boat course with a suitable body, such as the Irish Sailing Association.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, imperative that appropriate amendments are made to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which is included in the Bill to cater for the regulation of pleasure craft. Swift action is needed. We have seen some sad tragedies over the past few years involving jet skis and power boats. It is, therefore, vital in the new millennium that swift action is taken to prevent further loss of life.</P>
    <P>On the subject of safety, young people and the urgent need for them to be conscious of safety, in March 1999 I introduced the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Water Safety) Bill, the spirit and intent of which was accepted by the Government which promised to try to introduce suitable legislation before the summer recess of last year. It also promised to compile a comprehensive report on activity centres. I compliment it on having completed that report on time in June 1999, which was the commitment given in the House in March. I would welcome the legislation being in place before the summer recess of this year. The person who helped me focus on this matter was Michael Davies who was in the House last March when the Bill was discussed. He pressed for effective legislation and controls to be introduced. There is concern that we are dragging our heels on this issue. Michael Davies regrettably lost his son in the tragedy in Dunmore East. It is disappointing at this stage that we appear to be moving slowly. We are dealing with water, safety and marine casualties investigation, so we should try to progress the other legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Between December 1998 and September 1999 the Department produced reports on investigations into marine casualties involving loss of life. I wish to refer to three in particular in the context of the targets set in the Bill &ndash; the loss of the fishing vessels <i>Jenalisa</i> and <i>Scarlet Bucaneer </i>and the collision between the French vessel <i>Agena </i>and the Irish vessel <i>Orchidee</i>. I understand six people were drowned in these three marine casualties, an indication of the hazardous environment in which fishermen earn their livelihood and associated risks.</P>
    <P>Section 21 sets out a statutory target of nine months from the reporting of a casualty for the publication of a report. Although a laudable objective, is it achievable? There is often a long grieving process for next of kin while an investigation is being conducted. The families of James Power and Robert Doran had to wait seven years for a report on the investigation into the collision between the <i>Agena </i>and the <i>Orchidee</i> on 22 Sep<Col N="523" /> tember 1992. It was finally published in September 1999. Two members of the French vessel were found guilty of negligence by a French judge on 27 September 1996. This resulted in the investigation being prolonged. Section 25 of the Bill deals with the apportionment of blame or fault. The Minister is fully aware that the grief experienced by the Doran and Power families was compounded when it appeared to them that, despite the findings of the investigation, there was an apportionment of blame between the French and Irish vessels.</P>
    <P>The loss of the <i>Jenalisa </i>on 4 February 1996 resulted in the deaths of three fishermen. The report on the investigation was published almost three years later in December 1998. The loss of the <i>Scarlet Bucaneer</i> at Howth in November 1995 resulted in the death of the skipper, Mr. Tom Currid. The report on the investigation was published over three years later in March 1999.</P>
    <P>Although the target of nine months is laudable, is it achievable given past experience of casualty investigations? Based on past experience the marine casualty investigation unit, which I hope will be used only on rare occasions or not at all, will have to resort to presenting interim reports as provided for in section 31. While I recognise that a target has to be set, is the target of nine months too ambitious and rigid given past experience?</P>
    <P>To prevent accidents and casualties at sea emphasis has to be placed on safety. In 1996 the previous Minister, Deputy Barrett, produced an excellent document on safety in the fishing industry. It was a comprehensive analysis of the safety status of the fishing fleet. About 6% of the 1,352 vessels registered were over 24 metres in length. About 65% were less than 12 metres. The survey showed that the number of new entrants to the fleet was very low. I accept that the grant incentives for the whitefish fleet will help to ensure new vessels are satisfactory from a safety perspective.</P>
    <P>To establish the safety status of the fleet 150 vessels were surveyed by the safety review group which concluded that 64% had serious deficiencies, especially those in the 12 to 24 metre category. This is an exceptionally high figure. It also established that there was a general lack of consciousness of safety among fishermen and recommended that minimum safety standards should be set down for the fleet. The representatives of the fishing industry on the safety review group considered that the high number of older vessels had serious implications from a safety perspective. Unless the current approach to modernisation of the whitefish fleet is reflected in the operational programme for the period 2000 to 2006 the consequences for safety at sea will be serious. Unless generous financial incentives are given by the State and the European Union, particularly in the commercial fleet where margins are tight, the situation will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced safety grants for the fleet in successive years. How many vessels <Col N="524" /> have availed of these grants in the last three years since the report was produced? How many of the remaining vessels give cause for concern in terms of safety? What action will be taken to ensure minimum safety standards are applied within the fleet? Is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient staff in the marine survey office to conduct a survey of all vessels? The percentages for the registered fleet were extrapolated from a random sample of 150 vessels. If there is a necessity to beef up the marine survey office this should be done. It would be a small price to pay to prevent lives being lost at sea. The fleet should be included with jet skis, power boats, pleasure craft and youth activity centres. Greater emphasis is placed on safety in many continental countries, especially on inland waterways. In this context I welcome as a positive development the emphasis being placed on these reports to increase consciousness of the importance of safety. Before one can drive a motor car one has to do a driving test. It is crazy that a person does not have to undergo any test to use a jet ski or power boat, putting his or her life and the lives of others at risk in the process.</P>
    <P>In the past only serious marine casualties were investigated. This legislation is therefore desirable to change the current system which was established in 1894. If the recommendations of the safety review group were fully implemented and regulations introduced and effectively policed for pleasure craft the necessity to use the marine casualty investigation board would be minimised. This Bill is intended to strengthen the Minister's powers in the regrettable event of a marine casualty occurring. If the Minister suspects the involvement of alcohol or drugs, he will have the power to detain the crew and the vessel and carry out a thorough investigation. The Bill's objective is to ensure that such an investigation would be carried out within a limited time frame. The Bill's provisions are not intended to apportion blame. There is a feeling that when casualties occur, blame is apportioned in a certain direction. I understand the logic behind this Bill. The Minister is seeking to ensure that where marine casualties occur and investigations must be carried out, the Bill recommends a certain course of action in order to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Parallel with this, a comprehensive survey of all our vessels must be undertaken to ensure they are of a satisfactory standard from a safety and stability point of view.</P>
    <P>We are all shocked when we witness marine casualties. I have only been a Member of this House for the past ten years but I recall several occasions on which we lamented the loss of fishing trawlers at sea. We are all aware of the hazardous and hostile environment in which the trawlers operate and people should be given the necessary incentives, whether by the Government or the EU, to ensure the safety of their vessels. There will be a broad welcome for the important amendment of the Bill in regard to pleasure craft, power boats, jet skis and so on. If we introduce <Col N="525" /> regulations and instruct local authorities to introduce by-laws, we must specify the type of controls which should exist. A person should not be able to purchase a jet ski or a power boat without being properly equipped and trained in the craft's operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of Deputy Fahey as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Being based in Galway, he comes from a marine area. He may need some time to familiarise himself with the brief but I am sure the Minister of State will assist him. I welcome the legislation but I hope it will not be necessary to implement its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Finucane in saying <i>bon voyage</i> to the outgoing Minister, Deputy Woods, and I wish him every success in his new brief. I am sure he will encounter stormier waters in the Department of Education and Science than he did in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. I congratulate Deputy Fahey on his appointment to the Cabinet as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I hope he will follow the line taken by Deputy Woods who was always prepared to listen to the views of Opposition Members and other groups with an interest in marine activity. Deputy Woods went a considerable way towards meeting constructive proposals which I and my colleagues made over the years. I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, did not make it to the premier division &ndash; perhaps he will next time. We are glad he is still with us.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities do not have either the outdoor or the administrative staff to carry out their existing functions. As a town clerk once said to me, &ldquo;It's all very fine for you fellows to pass legislation in the Dáil, but it is pointless if you do not give us the money to employ manpower and purchase equipment to implement the regulations.&rdquo;. As someone who has been a local authority member for the past 25 years, I am satisfied that the necessary manpower would not be available to implement local authority by-laws in regard to the coast of County Louth, for example. Most of the activity referred to in this Bill will occur at weekends and during holiday periods. It would not be possible to ensure that local authority staff would be available to supervise by-laws laid down in regard to pleasure boat and other marine activities. We must specify how these provisions will be financed. Perhaps that will happen on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give a general welcome to this long overdue Bill. It is ludicrous that we have been depending on an Act passed more than 100 years ago for a legislative framework within which to deal with marine casualties. When the Act passed, steamers were still at an early stage of development and sailing vessels were the norm. Given the speed, power, size and technical sophistication of modern vessels, it is simply incomprehensible that we were relying on an Act <Col N="526" /> passed when Queen Victoria was still on the throne in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Bill arises from the report of the investigation of marine casualties policy review group established by Deputies Barrett and Gilmore when they served in the Department of the Marine. They are to be congratulated for their foresight in establishing the group which has produced a first class report. However, not all of the group's recommendations have been acted upon in this legislation. Perhaps the Minister will outline what the Department proposes to do in regard to the other activity recommended in the report but not contained in the legislation. Is it intended to publicise it through statutory instruments or regulations? This is a very important aspect of this debate.</P>
    <P>The report recommended that a period of seven years should pass before a person lost at sea should be presumed dead and that this period should be shortened by statute in the context of marine casualties where there is material evidence which indicates that the person has been lost at sea and is dead. I cannot see that any action has been taken in the Bill in this regard. The families of those who are lost at sea are often left in a prolonged state of limbo which is a terrible tragedy.</P>
    <P>The proper regulation of marine safety and the provision of a proper framework for the investigation of marine accidents is an important matter for any country. It is particularly important for Ireland as an island nation with one of the longest coastlines in Europe and as a country located adjacent to busy sea lanes. The loss of life involved in the sinking of the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> or the <i>Estonia</i> illustrates the terrible consequences which result when modern ferries get into difficulties. Hundreds of thousands of people pass to and from Britain and the continent by ferry each year. It is essential to ensure they have the highest degree of safety and protection available.</P>
    <P>While the ferries operating to and from the country have good safety records nothing can be taken for granted, as the two disasters I referred to show. Within the past year there have been a number of incidents involving the HSS Stena <i>Explorer.</i> In May the vessel was hit by fire while two months earlier it was involved in a docking accident in which it was holed below the waterline. Luckily these minor incidents were easily contained, but as we have seen in other cases, such incidents can become major tragedies at sea.</P>
    <P>While we have escaped large-scale shipping tragedies, there have been a number of accidents and sinkings which have resulted in loss of life. The pain and loss felt by the families of those who lost their lives is no less deep than that experienced by the families of those who died in major disasters. The 1991 collision involving the MV <i>Kilkenny</i> and the <i>Hasselwerder </i>resulted in the death of three B &amp; I crewmen. The disappearance of the <i>Carrickatine </i>with the loss of six lives in November 1995 was one of the most serious <Col N="527" /> disasters of recent years. Despite what was probably the most comprehensive search in the history of the State, the wreck was not found and the cause of the accident was not authentically established. Most distressingly for all of the families concerned, the bodies of the six crewmen involved were not recovered. There were other accidents. The MV <i>Jenalisa,</i> referred to by the Minister, sank with the loss of three lives in February 1996 and two drowned when the <i>Orchidee</i> was struck by the French registered <i>Agena</i> in September 1992.</P>
    <P>We tend to forget the constant dangers fishermen and crew members on merchant vessels face as they try to keep us supplied. It is in the nature of seafaring that no matter what precautions are taken, the elements and the danger of risk can never be totally eliminated. For example, a sudden change in the weather can leave major vessels exposed and human error can put others at risk.</P>
    <P>The huge increase in leisure boating and sailing brings further risks. There was the tragic loss of life of young people in an accident at Dunany in my constituency. Driver and passengers using the roadways must comply with statuary regulations covering the use of safety belts, insurance and licences. Yet, people can use high speed power boats without licence, insurance or even the proper equipment. On many occasions I have seen boats along the coastline of my constituency grossly overloaded in terms of personnel. There is a need to consider introducing regulations to cover these aspects and I look forward to debating this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will reserve my additional contributions on the Bill for Committee Stage, when I look forward to dealing with the matters raised in greater detail. I welcome the Bill. While it will be supported by the Labour Party, it will require amendments on Committee Stage. I look forward to the Minister's response to the points I have raised.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin mo chomhgháirdeas agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Woods as ucht na hoibre a rinne sé mar Aire na Mara. I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Education and Science. Members of the House must admit he is a very hard worker. He is highly regarded by groups for which he was responsible in the ministries he held. I am not sure if Deputy Bell is correct to say he is moving into stormier waters, but I am sure he will have <Col N="528" /> the calming effect he has always had. I wish him well.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution to this debate. The legislation deserves significant comment. I thank the two Oppositions spokespeople for presenting well researched views. It is indicative of the seriousness of their approach. Their acceptance of the Bill also indicates that they are more interested in what happens at sea than in making political points.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to conclude this debate by 2.30 p.m. but I will not do so because of the seriousness of this legislation. The issue of safety at sea was referred to by both Opposition spokespeople and the Minister. Most safety at sea measures could be applied if there was more common sense, and difficulties will continue in the absence of it, regardless of the legislative provisions introduced. For example, regardless of whether the saying that most fishermen cannot swim is true or false, it is an issue that must be addressed. It is also clear to those who live near the coast that very few of those who use craft, be it for leisure, fishing or commercial use, wear lifebelts.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in getting access to boats. For example, there are no regulations to prevent a 12 year old from taking a craft of any size out to sea. Often people go to sea on a whim and what was to have been a day of enjoyment sometimes ends in tragedy because of failure to apply regulations and commonsense measures. All those involved in the marine area should spread this message to those using the sea for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative regime to regulate the entire area of maritime casualty investigation in Ireland and to replace the current statutory system, which was established in 1894. That is not to say that old legislation is bad legislation &ndash; it had some excellent points.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the proposal in the 1999 senior euro card report of the Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs that a scheme should be established to provide for reciprocal travel arrangements for the elderly throughout Ireland; and the steps, if any, he proposes to implement this recommendation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs is based on the report <Col N="529" /> Towards a Senior Euro Pass which was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and was undertaken and published by Age Concern, England, at the end of 1997. It recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass is to submit observations in conjunction with other Departments and statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the euro pass is outside the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested, in advance of EU measures, that the cross-Border free travel scheme should be extended to allow free travel for all pensioners throughout the island of Ireland. The current scheme applies only to cross-Border journeys and not travel exclusively within each jurisdiction. The Deputy should note that my Department is responsible for the entire funding of this scheme. The Department of Rural Development, formerly the Department of Environment, Northern Ireland, contributes only 50% of the cost of bus journeys to the Border for Northern Ireland concession cardholders, a concession which was already in existence before the establishment of the cross-Border scheme. In contrast, my Department funds: 100% of the cost of the journey in the Republic for both free travel passholders and Northern Ireland concession cardholders; the balance, that is 50%, of the cost of cross-Border journeys in Northern Ireland for Northern Ireland concession cardholders and 100% of the cost of cross-Border journeys on trains for both Northern and Southern cardholders.</P>
      <P>The cost to my Department of the cross-Border free travel scheme in 1998 was in excess of £1.9 million. I note that the euro card equalisation fund mentioned by the Deputy in his report would not be in place to assist with the cost of operating this extension to the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>This measure, which would have to be considered both on a bilateral basis and in the context of possible national discrimination under EU legislation, would involve significant additional expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Minister has pointed out some of the difficulties in implementing my proposal. Does he think it is a good idea to have free travel for pensioners throughout the island of Ireland? It has much to commend it, not just because it is my proposal. Will he accept it is something we should aim for and try to implement? Will he accept that if there is a will there is a way and we can overcome any EU restrictions or regulations if we really want to put that system in place? Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that he has explored <Col N="530" /> every possibility of achieving this very laudable aim and objective?</P>

      <P>In the context of recent political developments over recent months, this will be taken up in the discussions I will have with my counterparts on the northern side of the Border. We have already requested a meeting with my counterpart on this and other issues which would be of relevance. There are some EU difficulties in that we cannot discriminate by bringing forward a scheme which would perhaps discriminate in favour of other nationalities, but any Member of this House would want to give older people free travel concessions throughout the island of Ireland. As the Deputy knows, this side of the Border instigated the original proposal relating to cross-Border travel and as he can see from the figures indicated already, we are more than paying our way in that respect. We are paying more than would be normal in the case of a reciprocal arrangement. This is an issue which will be part of my agenda in the future relating to discussions with my counterparts on the north side of the Border.</P>

Will he include it in his agenda for his first discussion with his Northern counterpart and investigate it to ensure that any EU restrictions can be overcome?

This issue has already been discussed within my Department and by me as one of the issues which could be considered for the mutual benefit of people north and south of the Border. This will be explored but, as I said, not only are there financial restraints, which could be overcome, there are also EU legislation constraints. There are legal issues involved in this. This issue must be considered not only on a bilateral basis but also taking into account the EU legislation, which to a certain extent could prohibit this concession if we were to give it to other nationalities.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on recent revelations that low income families are being charged high interest rates, up to 197% APR, by legal money lenders; the plans, if any, he has to enter into negotiations with other Ministers on the establishment of credit facilities for low income earners and those dependent on social welfare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation of moneylending is a matter for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs which operates under the control of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, under which legal moneylenders operate, does not set down maximum interest rates for moneylending. These rates are set by prevailing market forces</P>
      <P>My Department has a number of services available to respond to the problems arising in this area for low income earners and persons dependent on social welfare. The money advice and budgeting service, which was originally established in 1992 on a pilot basis as an approach to combating the problem of illegal moneylending, now operates nationwide through 50 local projects. The service is designed to target families and individuals identified as having problems with debt and moneylending. The projects give advice and assistance, but do not pay debts. Strong emphasis is placed on practical budget based measures that will succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit through the credit union movement. Each local project is an independent information and service provider, deeply rooted in the local community. Management committees are drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups and often include credit union representatives.</P>
      <P>A review of the money advice and budgeting service is currently in progress. This review will consider how the programme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. It is also intended that this review will be used to agree a strategic plan for the future development of the service so that it fully targets those who need it most. As soon as this is complete, I will consider the various issues raised in consultation with my colleagues as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, through the operation of the household budget scheme with An Post, my Department assists people who receive certain social welfare payments with money management by enabling them to pay a regular amount towards various household bills by direct deduction from their payments. This scheme is used mainly to cover local authority rents and mortgages and utilities. There is also provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme through its exceptional needs payments, whereby persons may qualify for a once-off payment from the <Col N="532" /> health board to help prevent undue hardship at times of exceptional expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Foley, of 7 January was truly shocking? Most Deputies were shocked to find that a company such as Jordan Estates Limited, as quoted here, charged interest rates of 197%, down to only 85%, when we know that many of those accessing these outrageous credit terms are the poorest people in our society, the 1.3 million people for whom the Minister has responsibility. I accept that other Ministers also have responsibilities and that MABS has been established. However, instead of ordering a very basic review, it is time the Minister tried to establish a guaranteed fund for the poorest sections of society to support and expand the work of MABS and to support credit unions and the banks which still thankfully remain in the public sector, including the Trustee Savings Bank. Is it not time the Minister took an initiative in this area? The Director of Consumer Affairs, according to her report, thinks it is appalling that these kinds of interest rates are being levied on the poorest sectors of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for the Director of Consumer Affairs. If she has a problem an amendment to the Consumer Credit Act would be the route to pursue to outlaw the type of maximum rates referred to in her report. I refer the Deputy to the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which was passed by the Government of which he was a member and which did not set maximum interest rate levels&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot abdicate responsibility &ndash; he voted for the legislation which did not set maximum interest rates for moneylending. Perhaps this is something which should be examined, but it is not an area for which I have direct or indirect responsibility.</P>
      <P>I have direct responsibility for the progression of MABS. Since coming into office in 1997 funding for MABS has doubled. My experience of MABS, both as a public representative and Minister, is that it is one of the most successful initiatives that has been brought forward. It was introduced by one of my predecessors, Dr. Michael Woods, as a response to illegal moneylending. The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in the course of the current review. None of us condone the high interest rates which one reads about from time to time in the newspapers. MABS assists those in difficulty in terms of moneylending. As long as I am Minister I will endeavour to assist MABS to expand even further.</P>

      <P>The contract under which An <Col N="534" /> Post supplies payments delivery services to my Department reached the end of its term on 31 December last. As the Deputy is aware, the Government had previously decided the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years, 2000 to 2002 inclusive. In accordance with the Government's decision, my Department and An Post commenced negotiations regarding the detailed business terms and conditions which would apply to this business arrangement during the period of the extension.</P>
      <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party which feels aggrieved by the Government's decision. In accordance with its usual practice in these matters, the Commission referred these complaints to my Department for its observations. Responses to complaints and the complex legal issues upon which they are based have been sent to the Commission. I understand the Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the complainant and the observations supplied by my Department. The outcome of this process will be notified to my Department in due course.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new three year contract. When these issues have been resolved my Department and An Post will resume negotiations with a view to having a new contract in place at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, the Government intends to fully comply with its EU obligations in this matter. As I have already stated in the House I am confident the Government decision to extend the existing arrangements with An Post will stand up to scrutiny. In the meantime, recognising that the payment delivery service which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>

Does he agree that he has landed his Department and An Post in this mess because of the stand he took in September 1998 when he argued that the contract had to go to public tender?

Over the period we have examined the issue which was effectively batted into the future by the previous Government, of which the Deputy was a member, when it decided to extend the contract for a three year period with the pro<Col N="535" /> viso that at the end of that period, which we have now reached, the new contract would be put to tender. Officials in my Department were working to a certain extent on the basis that we would have to put the contract out to tender. It was only with the involvement of myself, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach that an initiative was taken to examine the matter in more detail from a legal point of view. The advice of the then Attorney General was sought and based on that advice the Government decided to renew the contract with An Post. Therefore, the decision had a firm legal standing. The new Attorney General who has examined the issue anew has given similar advice. Therefore, as far as the Government is concerned the decision to conclude a contract with An Post for another three years will stand up to scrutiny. In the meantime delivery of payments will continue on an interim basis.</P>

Does he accept that in that situation he has given the ammunition to this outside company to haul him before the EU Commission? Does he accept this is the original basis of the problem? Does he agree that the delay in opening negotiations with An Post has also contributed to the legal limbo in which we now find ourselves?

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of carers providing support for the elderly and the disabled who are unable to qualify for a carer's allowance; and his views on whether the means test should be substantially eased and other measures introduced by way of support for them.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1853/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers. While care groups have estimated this figure to be approximately 100,000, it is not clear whether all these are full-time carers. Based on work in the review, the current figure is estimated to be about 50,000 people covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. The complete abolition of the means test would cost in excess of £150 million in a full year based on these estimates.</P>
      <P>At the end of December 1999 there were almost 14,400 carer's allowances in payment at a cost of almost £58 million. This is an increase of almost 60% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. The review of the allowance noted that it is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household income. The position and operation of the test will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a major package of improvements for carers in the 1999 budget at a cost of £18 mill<Col N="537" /> ion, including the improvement of the means test for carer's allowance. A disregard of £75 per week is applied to the income of a single carer and a disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a married couple. I announced the introduction of a carer's benefit scheme in the recent budget. I am delighted to inform the Deputy that I secured Government approval at the Cabinet meeting in Ballaghaderreen to extend the duration of the scheme from 12 months, as announced, to 15 months to bring it in line with other schemes of this nature. It will provide financial support and allow carers to avail of a job-protected leave of absence for up to 15 months.</P>
    <P>This new benefit will be based on a person's PRSI contributions and will come into effect in October 2000. Full details will be given in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill. In addition, I have made provision for an increase in the amount of the annual respite care grant for qualified carers from £200 to £300. Building further on measures I introduced in the previous budgets, I also extended the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes to all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. These extensions ensure that carers will qualify for all free schemes from October. The extensive measures that I have introduced in recent budgets to benefit carers clearly indicate my commitment and that of the Government to carers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the main focus should be on those carers who get nothing? Does he agree that, even based on his figures, 35,000 people do not receive a cent in support from the Government? Some people say that figure could be as high as 85,000, but even using his figures the vast majority get nothing. Does he further accept that it is economically wise and socially just to provide some support for those carers? Does he agree that they are the forgotten people in our society and it is time that something was done for them? Does he further agree that the relatively modest initial pre-budget proposal which I made should be backed by him whereby the means test would be relaxed to include a further 10,000 carers and the Minister for Finance would be asked to introduce a tax allowance for other carers who do not qualify for an allowance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will stand over its record on carers and put it up for scrutiny against that of the Opposition parties when they were in office. The figures speak for themselves. There has been a 60% increase in the number receiving the carer's allowance in just two and a half years. In addition, the new carer's benefit scheme will pick up a considerable number of those who would not normally qualify for the allowance, to whom the Deputy referred. It is a PRSI-based scheme which had been sought in <Col N="538" /> many discussions with me during my time in office. It is beneficial and I made changes in the disregard in the first budget. It is something which I will examine in future budgets. I have taken into account all the changes made by the Government in the last three budgets, which not only apply to my Department but also to the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to asking the Minister for Finance to make changes. He made major changes in the tax allowances for carers in the home in the 1999 budget. Changes were made recently in the disabled person's grants scheme and the Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for care of people in the home and in institutions, has provided significant extra funding in this area since the Government took office.</P>

Does he agree that, with total Opposition support, something must be done for them and it is in the interests of the country to do so? The famous move by the Minister for Finance only brought in 400 people. Is the Minister aware of that?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the observations of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressing concern on the persistence of poverty among the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in Ireland, notably the disabled, the traveller community, children, elderly women and single women with children, and highlighting the inadequacy of welfare benefits and in particular that children's benefits are not sufficient to cover the cost of bringing up a child; and the further proposals, if any, he has to improve the situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1855/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the observations of the United Nations committee. These were provided in response to the submission of Ireland's first report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which refers to developments occurring in the period to 1996. However, the <Col N="539" /> UN, in its observations, did not confine itself to that period but also to the 1996-99 period, on which it had solicited information.</P>
      <P>The groups mentioned by the committee, such as people with disabilities and single women with children, are among those identified in the national anti-poverty strategy as being at particular risk of poverty. Consistent poverty stands at between 7% and 10%, and such groups as the disabled, retired and those on home duties, accounting for the majority of the groups referred to by the Deputy, have benefited from the overall reduction in the numbers of consistently poor.</P>
      <P>In response, the Government announced a new consistent poverty target of less than 5% by 2004. The achievement of this would mean we will have made significant progress in our strategy on social inclusion. Social welfare payment rates remain a central factor in determining trends in poverty. The Government is committed to at least maintaining the value of social welfare payments in real terms and, indeed, in recent years there have been significant increases in excess of inflation. Between 1997 and 2000, social welfare payments increased by 16% to 23% compared to a total rise in the consumer price index of just over 6% during the same period. In addition, all social welfare rates are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, meeting a key target of both Partnership 2000 and NAPS.</P>
      <P>As part of our recent review of this Government's action programme we have reaffirmed our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week, undertaken to increase also the non-contributory pension to this level by 2002 and committed ourselves to increasing all social welfare pensions in line with average earnings over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>Increases of this nature reflect a real improvement in the living standards of those dependent on welfare payments which, together with the dramatic progress made in terms of employment creation, have provided substantial real increases in the incomes of lower income households and a marked reduction in deprivation.</P>
      <P>Finally, the recent budget provides for an additional full-year investment of almost £106 million in child benefit, bringing the total full-year cost of the scheme to some £580 million per annum. This reflects the value the Government places on the scheme as an effective vehicle for tackling poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not embarrassed that a reputable UN committee has delivered a report of this nature? Does he take pride in the fact that the report has cause to highlight the inadequacy of welfare benefits and, in particular, that child benefits are not sufficient to cover the costs of bringing up a child? Does he not believe that when the country is awash with money we should be getting away from that kind <Col N="540" /> of report and he should be able to convince his ministerial colleagues to give him the necessary money to turn this around? Does he accept that the CORI figure of £900 million would eliminate poverty entirely?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the day social welfare increases are one of the ways in which people can be brought out of poverty. I will give the Deputy some figures to illustrate what we have done since coming to office. Old age contributory pensions have increased by 23.1% over that period. Non-contributory old age pensions have increased by 26.7%; widow's pension, under 66 years, by 14.1%; widow's non-contributory pension has increased by 14.8%; unemployment benefit and disability benefit, 14.8% in both long-term unemployment, UB and DB; short-term UA has increased by 16.2%. All those percentages are well in excess of the rate of inflation and of anything given by the previous Government when inflation was somewhat higher. I accept the report. Obviously we must do more. That is one of the reasons we looked at the reasonably conservative benchmarks laid in the national anti-poverty strategy in relation to targets that must be reached in order to eradicate and reduce poverty. Many of those targets have been met but we are not satisfied with that. We set new, more ambitious targets to reduce the number of those in persistent poverty to under 5% by the year 2004. We are well ahead of that. We are all practical politicians. Even the Deputy must be speaking tongue in cheek because the reality is that over the past number of years the level of poverty has reduced dramatically.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to fulfil the Chair's request. I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 37 together. I indicated to the House at budget time that I will be moving over the next three years to increase the qualified adult allowance to 70% of the main rate. This is in line with the commitment in the Government's action programme to refocus the welfare system in favour of the family unit and the findings of the report of the household review group. Last December's budget starts this process by providing special increases so as to raise all qualified adult allow<Col N="542" /> ance rates above 60% of the appropriate personal rate from May this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the appropriate level of QAA rates, the Commission on Social Welfare in its 1986 report recommended that the rates of payment for qualified adults should be set at 60% of the basic payment for a single person. The commission argued that two people living together, especially couples, are financially interdependent as all of the living costs such as housing, fuel and household goods are shared and there are economies of scale involved. However, the commission's recommendation was not based on any original research into equivalence scales and reservations were subsequently expressed about this level.</P>
      <P>Recent work undertaken by the ERSI for the interdepartmental working group on the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare systems has pointed out that there is no consensus on this point and that different methodologies yield different results. The ESRI work in this area, however, suggested an equivalence scale for a second adult in the region of 70% and this is the approach which is being adopted by the Government.</P>
      <P>QAA, along with a range of other issues are under discussion with the social partners as part of the negotiations on a possible successor to Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The ESRI report was published in August and I immediately secured Government approval of the acceptance of that suggestion on the level of QAA, 70%. Individualisation of social welfare payments is an issue that has been around for some time. The working group that looked at it did not reach any conclusion. Obviously there are ways and means of doing it. This issue has been around for quite some time and the working group which examined it could not reach any conclusion in that respect. Obviously there are ways and means of doing it, and those are being examined in the context of the partnership talks and in relation to future policies, but the best benchmark we can reach is that suggested by the experts in the area, the ESRI, and the Government is committed to doing that. We have already given that commitment in the recent budget.</P>

Will the Minister accept that is an outrageous way for the Government to treat the poor? Furthermore, this week, without any announcement, the butter voucher scheme was abolished, a scheme that has been in existence for the past 21 years. One million people will be deprived of their butter vouch<Col N="544" /> ers. That is another saving of £4 million without any compensation whatever.</P>

      <P>The working group commissioned the ESRI to undertake research into equivalent scales. The ESRI work in this area pointed out that there was not a consensus on this issue; the different methodologies yielded different results. The ESRI came to the conclusion of 70%, and we should aim for that. There are different ways of defining individualisation, and these were examined by the working group. The first is the payment of QAA's direct to the person concerned, as is currently the case; increasing the QAA to the same level as the personal rate, which obviously would cost a great deal of money; and full independent treatment in payment and under means tests of all those under the system. That means dividing them 50-50, but it would be difficult to make that mandatory, if we were to introduce a system whereby we would split the existing payments without increasing the QAA dramatically up to 100%, something to which we would all aspire. The working group concluded that the best way of accomplishing this was through the social insurance system, that this was already under way with the increasing workforce and that everybody would have a stamp record. Also, there was a fall of 25% in QAA's over that period.</P>

What has the Minister done about the basic income issue over the past two and a half years? This is very much related to the issue of dependence on social welfare benefits. Also, we understand that the voluntary pillar in the current partnership negotiations is demanding a basic income of 50% of medium income. Would this be for every adult citizen, and how much would it cost? Is the Minister committed to introducing such a measure this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 24, 29, 30 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to inform the House that I have secured Government approval to extend the duration of the carer's benefit scheme from 12 months, as I announced in the recent budget, to 15 months. This new carer's benefit scheme will provide financial support and allow carers to avail of a job-protected leave of absence for a period of up to 15 months. This will recognise that leaving employment to provide care is a contingency broadly similar to other contingencies under the <Col N="547" /> social insurance code and, as such, the benefit will fill a gap in the social insurance system. This new benefit will be based on a person's PRSI contributions and will come into effect in October 2000. Further details of this new scheme will be given in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was published in October 1998. Both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance were represented on this committee.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have estimated this figure to be around 100,000 carers, it is not clear that all of these are full-time carers. Based on work in the review, the current figure is estimated to be around 50,000 people covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. This figure is projected to increase considerably over time. Based on these estimates, the abolition of the means test would cost in excess of £150 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>At the end of December 1999, there were almost 14,400 carer's allowances in payment at a cost of almost £56 million. Deputy Crawford will be interested to hear that this was an increase of almost 60% in the number of carers in receipt of this allowance since this Government took office two and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household income. However, the position in regard to the means test will be kept under review in a budgetary context. I introduced a major package of improvements in the 1999 budget at a cost of £18 million. One of the measures involved changes in the means test for carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The review group also examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It is similar to the requests for a cost of disability payment which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended should be introduced by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. This policy was reaffirmed last August when the residency conditions for the carer's allowance were relaxed considerably. The original residency requirement, that the carer must live with the care recipient, was put in place to safeguard the interests of the care recipient. <Col N="548" /> This requirement was examined as part of the review of the carer's allowance and it was proposed that this rule be relaxed to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme. On foot of this I brought forward new arrangements which were put in place in August to allow non-resident carers who were, broadly speaking, living next door to the care recipient to qualify. The underlying principle is that the care recipient receives the full-time care and attention he or she needs. If Deputies have concerns about specific cases in this area, I will be happy to examine them.</P>
    <P>The many measures I have introduced in recent budgets clearly indicate my personal commitment, and that of the Government to carers. We have enabled people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities and we appreciate the valuable role performed by carers in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been critical of the Minister on many issues today but I commend him for extending the carer's benefit to 15 months. Why, however, do we have to wait until October for this to start? As the social welfare spokesman for the Labour Party, I have received many complaints from people in rural areas that the residency rule is being interpreted very rigidly. I have a letter from a councillor&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's officials told us at a meeting of the Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs that to abolish the means test for carers would cost only £150 million. Surely in the era of a e100 billion economy, the Minister could afford that money to give a basic income to the 50,000 people who have had an endless slog over many years in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had £150 million to spend tomorrow, I would not spend it in a slap-dash manner. I would like to look at the recipient and what he or she requires, as was recommended in the review of the carer's allowance. It is not the same in every case. The suggestion in the carer's review was that we should bring forward a needs assessment. As a result of that suggestion, my Department and the Department of Health and Children, under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, have set up a working group to look at needs assessment. I understand the Department of Health and Children proposes to bring forward a pilot scheme for this to see how it works.</P>
      <P>I have kept a close eye on residency requirements because I was interested in changing the regulations. I told my officials that I wanted them reviewed. If cases came forward which show anomalies, we will look again at changing the regulations because I do not want them to be interpreted strictly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the reaction of the Carers Association to the budget? It stated that the budget was grossly unfair to family carers, the vast majority of whom are women, who remain at home to care for a person who is severely disabled, frail in old age or terminally ill. That was the association's reaction to the marginal improvements introduced in the budget. Does the Minister accept there should be a quantum improvement now which would bring in many more carers? Does he accept there is too much bureaucracy involved and that some of the regulations are being interpreted very strictly? I have been told of the case of a person caring for an 86 year old man, who is quite frail, who was refused the allowance because the man being cared for does not need that care. How ridiculous can we get in the implementation of these regulations? Will the Minister ensure they are implemented in a flexible and sensible fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy said about the reaction of the carers lobby groups. If the Deputy asked any of those groups which Government has done most for carers in recent years they would admit that this Government and this Department has done most. The vast majority of the proposals in the carers' review set up by my Department have been implemented in a very short time. The report was published only a year ago. A new carer's benefit scheme is not mere tinkering, it is a major issue. The social partners sought this in the partnership negotiations but I brought it forward before those talks had concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any new benefits for carers. I have, however, heard of a case of a woman who is looking after her sister who is suffering from terminal cancer. Because her husband is in an ordinary job, she cannot get help. If she was not looking after her sister, the State would have to do so at enormous cost. Does the Minister accept that since he entered office he has not increased the disregard for a married couple? It was increased from £50 to £150 by the Minister's predecessor. The Minister has not increased that figure in three budgets in a time of inflation and increased wages.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister re-examine how the means test is carried out, particularly when people employed in agriculture are involved? Although it is not relevant to the carer's allowance, I came across a case relevant to means testing in which two cows and six bullocks were judged to create an income for a 75 year old farmer of £3,300. The lady in charge of that means test should not have been in charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I entered office the figure for the carer's allowance has increased by 60% and the number of recipients has increased by 60%. The means test is the most generous of all social welfare means tests. I will keep it under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> This year I wanted to bring forward the carer's benefit which is the best way to proceed. There are now 1.7 million people in work compared to one million in 1990, so strategically it is better to have a carer's benefit scheme enabling people at work to take time off to help someone in the home. The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which will never compensate someone who is caring for a person at home. That must be accepted. We will endeavour to increase it as much as possible. My record withstands scrutiny and is ahead of anyone else's who has been in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Department, or any Department, carried out research into the demographic trends associated with an ageing population and the future needs of older people who may need care in their homes?

      <P>Our population will get older and this is something we must all bear in mind in our personal and institutional planning. The Minister for Finance and I have put forward a proposal for a fund for pensions. The issue of caring for an older population is one which must be planned for strategically. The carer's benefit will allow people who have a contribution record to take time off work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That research has been done by the Department. It fits in with the research that <Col N="551" /> has been done on pensions. At the moment we have a population of approximately 440,000 people over 65. In 50 years time we will have a population of more than one million over 65. Governments will have to take these figures into account in their long-term planning. In relation to pensions, for which I have direct responsibility, that has been done. On the issue of caring for the elderly, the Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for caring, will do the necessary planning. This includes planning for the future demands on carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>These are all demand-led schemes. The more people who apply for them the more money we must pay. At the moment there are five workers to every one person over 65. In 50 years time there will be only two workers for every person over 65.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that had it not been for the increase in the disregard from £50 to £150 we would not have such a large number of people in receipt of carer's allowance? There is a need to improve the disregard. Will the Minister consider making such an improvement in the Social Welfare Bill?</P>
      <P>I campaigned for the relaxation in the residency requirement for carers and I appreciate that measure. Can the Minister give an exact guideline for distance of residence of carers. Officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs appear to be imposing strict limitations on where a carer may live and on the exact number of hours devoted by the carer to the elderly person. If someone is caring for an elderly neighbour or relative living a mile or two away, he or she cannot hold down another job. There seems to be inconsistency in applying the regulations and this is causing problems.</P>

      <P>I have been keeping an extremely close eye on the issue of residency and I had occasion to ring a Fine Gael Deputy yesterday regarding a parliamentary question he had asked on this issue. I felt the case he referred to should have been allowed but the deciding officer had made a decision based on the regulations that have been put in place. I am keeping a close eye on the regulations and I have given an undertaking to the carers' association to review the issue of residency after six months and, if necessary, change the regulations. This is a very difficult issue because no matter where the line is drawn someone will be just outside it. I know of one <Col N="552" /> very harrowing case of a carer who lives approximately four miles from the person being cared for. The regulation states that the carer should live within easy walking distance.</P>
      <P>A Deputy asked why carer's benefit is being introduced in October. The introduction of a new scheme takes some time and that is why it will begin in October. It is being brought in quicker than it might have been because I have removed it from the area of partnership talks.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, regarding the £5 million fund for out of school hours child care in areas of disadvantage.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1914/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in the budget, an annual allocation of £5 million has been provided to my Department to support provision of out of school hours and child care services in disadvantaged communities. It is envisaged that the funding will mainly be made available to the projects funded under the community development support programmes. These are: the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the core funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee on child care recommended that funding be provided totalling £5 million per annum for community groups towards developing out of school hours services. The committee anticipated that the provision of this funding to less well off communities would address a number of issues, including: the provision of low cost out of school child care for parents who are in low paid employment; practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school; the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life; and the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the spirit of partnership which informs the way in which these community development programmes are managed in my Department a working group representative of the local community development groups themselves and other interests and expertise in the child care area is being set up to advise on the detailed design of this scheme and in particular issues such as criteria for applications, technical support needs, service standards and staff issues.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the working group will be convened in early February and the availability of the grants will be advertised more widely once the detailed scheme has been drawn up and agreed. Given the need to allow sufficient time for local groups to draw up and submit applications, I anticipate that I will be in a position to commence allocation of moneys under the scheme in April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>This tiny initiative is welcome <Col N="553" /> but it is a drop in the ocean. Does the Minister agree that many Deputies were struck on budget night by the fact that his entire child care package was only worth approximately the same as the cut in capital taxation? The sum of £5 million is very small. Can the Minister guarantee that child care and out of school projects which have been established by Leader and Partnership companies, particularly in the south and south-east which receives less European money, will be funded by his Department? The Minister would need to spend £50 million and not £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot have read the speech of the Minister for Finance. The interdepartmental committee suggested that the Government, from now until 2004 or 2005, would spend approximately £46.6 million in each year. The budget provision for the coming year is £46.6 million, as suggested by the interdepartmental group. What the group asked for is being granted by the Minister for Finance. Part of that is the £5 million which will go to the community development projects and the family support services.</P>
      <P>Already, as a result of initiatives taken by me and by my predecessor, the majority of the centres funded by the family and community support services programme of my Department have crèche and child care facilities because part of the funding already being given to them is spent on those services. About 50% of the community development projects have créche and child care facilities. Given that the provision of £200,000 for after school support services which I initiated last year has been increased to £5 million, we will be hard pressed to spend it in the coming year.</P>

The Minister says the details are not in place, but will he come back to the House with a full report on the operation of the scheme when the details are worked out? It could be a good scheme but it might require more funding. However, let us see it in <Col N="554" /> operation first.

      <P>It is far more than was given by any of my predecessors. With regard to the issue before us, I was delighted to get this allocation because I have endeavoured, since being appointed Minister, to ensure that the community development projects and family support services, which are generally located in and targeted at areas of deprivation, will have proper cre±che and child care facilities to allow families who have been in deprivation and perhaps never had the opportunity of employment to avail of them. I am particularly concerned about lone parents. The State needs to encourage them back into the workplace. They are an untapped resource in that respect. Time and again, however, people in that position will point out that they have nobody to mind their children. In the areas for which I have direct responsibility, I will ensure that the £5 million is well spent.</P>
      <P>I undertake to come back to the House in this regard although I do not know when the Deputy expects me to do so. The applications for funding will be sent out in April and they will have to be examined before the money is spent. Perhaps when the scheme has expended the moneys, we can carry out an assessment of how they have been spent.</P>

      <P>The recent budget package represents the biggest ever social welfare allocation, amounting to approximately £423 million on a <Col N="555" /> full year basis. Among the major improvements included in the package are: a £7 weekly increase in the maximum personal rates of pension for pensioners and an £11.70 per week increase for a couple on contributory pension; a £14.50 per week increase for a couple on a non-contributory pension; a £4 weekly increase in the personal rates for other social welfare recipients under 66 years, together with a £3.80 increase in the qualified adult allowance.

      <P>&mdash;instead of the announced £4 in the budget will now get £5.90. There is also an £8 increase in the monthly child benefit for each of the first two children, with a £10 increase per month for each other child.</P>
      <P>In addition, I brought forward the effective dates of payment for all weekly payments by four weeks. As a result of the changes introduced by me since my appointment to office, the budget increases are now paid for 35 weeks of the initial year as opposed to 29 weeks under the last Government.</P>
      <P>The cost of the various increases in weekly social welfare payments, including FIS improvements, in the 2000 budget amounts to over £256 million on a full year basis. The additional cost of bringing these increases forward by four weeks to 6 April 2000 would amount to almost £20 million. I intend to complete the process of bringing forward the implementation date for increases in weekly payments by another four weeks in April 2001.</P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, common sense must apply, irrespective of what regulation may be in place, and all sides of the House agree with that. That said, it does not always apply on board craft. If we say it often enough perhaps people will get the message. We will probably have to concentrate on young people in school. With the former Minister, Deputy Woods, having now been reassigned the Education and Science portfolio, he would have a feel for that approach.</P>
      <P>While the 1894 legislation governing the investigation of marine casualties has served us well, it is clearly in need of modernisation to provide for a more open approach required by changes in public values and the trend towards more open government in conducting such investigations. We need to bring marine casualty investigation in Ireland into line with the requirements of a modern society with a top class system which meets people's needs and expectations, especially those bereaved by marine tragedies. The Department and I have endeavoured to ensure investigations into marine accidents are conducted in this open manner in recent years. Having successfully introduced the system of publishing casualty reports, we now want to make public a legal requirement with specific time limits so that reports are produced and published swiftly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This came about with the sinking of the <i>Orchidee </i>and the accident in which Jimmy Power and Bobby Doran lost their lives some seven <Col N="559" /> years ago. I share the view that seven years is too long to have to wait for a report. Deputy Finucane asked if the target of nine months was too ambitious. The recommendation was that we should try to have it in three. In this instance, it would have been impossible to produce a report in nine months because it depended on litigation in France and it was difficult to have the case included on the books of the French courts. I was heavily involved in that having known both families well. In that context, I welcome the legislation as it is good law.</P>
    <P>Widespread publication of the findings and recommendations of accident investigators will bring to the attention of vessel owners and seafarers the need for giving safety top priority. We cannot say that often enough. Furthermore, establishing as quickly as possible the facts behind a tragedy can often be a comfort in difficult times for bereaved. We would all have seen this from time to time. While I am anxious that such openness be maintained, I am aware that it should not impede the primary objective of an investigation which is to establish as quickly as possible the causes of the casualty and to make recommendations on measures to be taken to avoid a recurrence. If that could happen, we would all be happy.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new system of investigation identified by the marine casualties policy review group to replace the system established in 1894 and which is provided for in the Bill will meet the required needs and lead to a major improvement not only in the law governing investigations but also in the procedures which will be established for the conduct of such investigations. The establishment of an independent marine casualty investigation board, employing the highest international standards, is a key and innovative step designed to lead to the more open and transparent approach which is desired. A strong independent board with the necessary powers to fully investigate the causes of marine tragedies will help to ensure that lessons to be learned can be used to help avoid similar accidents in future.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill for an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, will accommodate new framework legislation to redress the deficiencies identified in existing law and provide a uniform and effective set of conditions to regulate the use of recreational and pleasure craft in Ireland. It will allow local authorities to enact by-laws to control the use of jet skis and fast power craft as an initial step, something clearly recommended to me by the action group on small powered recreational craft in its interim report which I received in November last.</P>
    <P>All local authorities which have contacted me, especially the local authorities in Wexford, which have a substantial coastline and around which there have been too many tragedies and some dif<Col N="560" /> ficulties with jet skis, felt they did not have the power to make by-laws and consequently to move on the matter. This new framework will allow them do that and, as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, I encourage it. We can make regulations introducing national provisions governing the safe use of such craft.</P>
    <P>Having this framework in place quickly is critical on two fronts. One, it enables me to provide the sound legislative basis for these authorities to make by-laws this year covering the use of fast craft in local areas. Two, it enables me to act immediately on further recommendations which may come from the action group in its final report to me at the end of February next.</P>
    <P>While noting that we will return to this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage, I wish to comment on some of the points raised by Deputies. Regarding the marine casualty aspect of the Bill, the proposed timeframe of nine months between a casualty occurring and the publication of a report may be perceived as an ambitious target as I indicated earlier. I believe that, in 99% of cases, it is not alone desirable but achievable. It is because of the unacceptable delays in publication under the current system that I want to ensure these delays are eliminated in future. I am also aware of the need to ensure that lessons learned from an investigation are disseminated to the maritime community as soon as possible to help ensure that similar accidents do not recur. I am sure everyone in the House can spread that message and it is important we do so. The policy review group recommended a period of three months but this was unrealistic, hence my decision to propose a timeframe of nine months.</P>
    <P>On another time related issue Deputy Bell referred to the common law presumption that when a person has been missing for seven years or more that person is presumed to be dead. This is an issue for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the context of laws governing the operations of the Coroner's Court. The Deputy can be assured we keep in close contact with the Minister on that issue because it arises every so often.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed legislation on pleasure craft, including fast power craft and jet skis, I agree with the Deputies that implementing regulations should be introduced as soon as possible. It is my intention to do this through the powers being made available in the Bill once I have considered the findings and recommendations of the action group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell raised two issues relating to the role of local authorities in the context of the proposed legislation for pleasure craft, including fast powered craft and jet skis. I have asked the action group to specifically consider in its final report the issues of enforcement and resources as well as recommending a series of guidelines to be used <Col N="561" /> by local authorities when introducing by-laws for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputies raised some other issues not directly related to the Bill but to which I would like to reply briefly and I thank them for taking the opportunity of raising them with me. On legislation dealing with adventure and activity centres, a new division has been established in the Department to deal with the marine leisure sector. One of its priority tasks is to draw up the legislation to which Deputy Finucane referred. It is included in the Government's legislative programme for this semester. Everything will be done to meet this schedule. I would welcome an input from the Deputy who has a particular interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>On fishing vessel safety, a number of initiatives have been taken since the publication of the report of the safety review group. The Department is liaising closely with the industry on future regulations to improve safety standards. The industry has been circulated recently with a set of draft regulations on safety requirements to allow for a fully inclusive consultative process. As regards the details of grants awarded I will revert to the Deputy directly at a later date when a full set of data is to hand. In the first instance responsibility for safety rests with the person or persons concerned. They must be encouraged to use their common sense. The issue of emergency tugs is being actively examined on foot of a report recently submitted to me. It has high priority.</P>
    <P>On staffing levels at the marine survey office, consultants have recently been appointed to conduct a comprehensive review of the Department's marine regulatory services. This will include an examination of existing resources of all divisions involved in the delivery of these services.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. All the points raised have been noted and will be given every consideration. I am naturally concerned to ensure every feasible measure is introduced to improve safety standards. I am confident that the provisions contained in the Bill will form an integral part of my strategy to enhance safety standards throughout the seafaring community as we enter the new millennium.</P>

    <Title>National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The national beef assurance scheme is an intrinsic part of the Government's policy to tighten up the conditions for the production and processing of cattle and beef. It is designed to protect the interests of consumers and ensure purchasers of Irish beef products are satisfied about the food safety and hygiene standards of such products. Following the outbreak of BSE in 1995 consumers' views in Ireland and throughout Europe of the food products they consume have changed fundamentally. Europe's 370 million consumers want to be satisfied that all aspects of the food chain are safe. Concerns were heightened following the chicken dioxin case in Belgium last year. For many years Irish beef and food products have been produced to the highest standards. Irish beef products are recognised as among the safest and as of the best quality that can be purchased within the European Union.</P>
      <P>The BSE outbreak resulted in the renationalisation of food purchasing in all EU member states. In essence the Irish were buying Irish food, the French were buying French food, the Belgians were buying Belgian food and so on. This had the effect of rupturing the beef industry in Ireland and throughout Europe and flew in the face of the MacSharry reforms of 1992 which were designed to ensure greater competition in the food sector. Worse still, traditional Arabian markets which received Irish beef products with open arms for many years turned their backs on Irish food products. The elimination of our ability to sell our products on Third World markets such as Iran and the reduction in sales of our beef products to EU markets have played havoc with the beef industry in the last five years. I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, that he is redoubling his efforts to have these Arabian markets reopened in the near future.</P>
      <P>I congratulate An Bord Bia on the work it is doing to increase sales of Irish beef products within EU markets. Much progress has been made in the last 18 months but more needs to be done if such market shares are to be enhanced and increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union recognises that food safety is of the utmost importance if Irish and European agriculture and the respective food industries are to be protected. The European Commission recently published a White Paper on food safety outlining up to 80 directives which will have to be implemented in the next three years to safeguard all aspects of the European food chain. I welcome this change of emphasis at EU level and that a European food safety auth<Col N="563" /> ority will be established in the near future. Under Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Union has greater power in promoting consumer protection measures and public health provisions with particular emphasis on protecting human health. Food safety will be a central aspect in the World Trade Organisation talks which will take place over the next three years with the two principal parties, the European Union and the United States of America, at loggerheads over many aspects of the proposed EU changes governing the food industry. The US Government will have to recognise that European consumers' views have changed fundamentally and that the labelling of American food products to EU markets will have to comply with the request from the EU.</P>
    <P>The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill comes into play in regard to this latter point. The Bill is a key Government response to adopt measures to tighten up the production conditions of cattle and beef and to assure consumers and buyers of its safety. Common high standards of production and processing will be developed in the cattle, beef and animal feed sectors. These standards will be applied through a process of mandatory registration, inspection and approval and will cover all participants in the industry, including farmers, cattle dealers, live exporters, livestock marts, abattoirs, meat processing plants and the animal feed manufacturing and trading sectors. The Bill will not apply to the retail trade sector but there will be an obligation on the sector to deal only with participants of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The intention is that only persons who meet the prescribed standards will be approved for participation in the cattle, beef and feedstuff industries. All participants in the scheme will be subject to an inspection, the procedures for which will be determined by the Minister. If participants comply with the provisions of the Bill, they will be issued with a final approval notice. The period of validity of this approval will be open ended. However, all approved parties will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the scheme. Participants who are found not to be in compliance will be informed of the steps which must be taken to make them compliant.</P>
    <P>Section 8 places a duty on existing farmers, feed manufacturers or traders, dealers or exporters of live animals, abattoirs, assembly centres, marts and meat plants and any new entrants into the marketplace to apply for a certificate of approval within a 12 month period of entry into force of the legislation. Section 9 provides for the transitional period under which all participants will be deemed to be provisionally approved and empowers the Minister to impose conditions on participants during the transitional period. Section 13 provides for the establishment of a register of holders of certificates of approval and outlines the information to be held in the register. Section 14 provides that certificates of <Col N="564" /> approval will not be transferable and outlines the arrangements which may apply when an individual certificate holder dies for the continuation of that certificate for the benefit of the deceased person's personal representatives for a limited period. Section 15 empowers the Minister to refuse an application for the granting of a certificate of approval and outlines the procedures the Minister must follow to notify the appropriate applicants. Section 21 obliges keepers of animals to notify the authorities of various cattle movements. This provision is more or less operating at present as cattle movements are being computerised on a nationwide basis. Section 25 outlines the maximum penalties applicable to persons found guilty of offences under the Bill. The maximum penalties proposed are £1,500 or 12 months' imprisonment or both. In respect of summary offences, a £100,000 fine or five years' imprisonment is applicable in respect of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>It is the interests of all those participating in the Irish food industry that various initiatives would be implemented to improve the quality of Irish food products before they are sold in various markets, including those of EU member states. It is incumbent on all of us to recognise the important provisions in the Bill. By doing so, we will promote an image of Irish food products at home and abroad, assist the food industry to market such products into the future and copper-fasten an ever-growing job creation sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The national beef assurance scheme is primarily intended to restore confidence in a crucial sector of our national food producing sector, namely the beef industry. While I welcome the thrust of the Bill, there are significant gaps in the legislation.</P>
      <P>In an era in which food scares are a continuing cause for concern on a near daily basis, the Bill does not go far enough to assure the consumer of the safety of Irish beef. Consumer concerns with the meat industry include, among others BSE, e.coli 0157 and salmonella. Issues such as animal welfare, problems with drug residues and quality indicators such as the origin, age, breed and feeding regime of an animal are also of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumers at home and abroad expect to be able to buy safe, wholesome Irish food at a reasonable price. This Bill is a step in the right direction in ensuring food safety and many of my comments will relate to the consumer concerns experienced due to the lack of adequate controls in the meat industry in the past. The fall-out from events such as the BSE crisis, the dioxin scare late last year and food poisoning associated with e.coli 0157 have all damaged the reputation of the meat industry. Yesterday, the outgoing Minister for Health and Children referred to the post-BSE era. Unfortunately, we are not in the post-BSE era at all as the number of cases of BSE has been increasingly steadily since 1995. The number of reported outbreaks for 1999 was 91, the highest number to date. E.coli 0157 is also a significant <Col N="565" /> problem with 51 cases being reported in 1999. As this is not a notifiable disease, this number does not provide a complete picture of the number of cases occurring in Ireland. We, therefore, have no reason to be complacent about the safety of our food chain.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence is very fragile and each new outbreak further undermines belief in the system of controls which is in place. The consequence of this lack of confidence is that the consumer, whether an individual or large multinational, seeks out alternative supply sources. Confidence in national and European authorities and in scientists has been damaged as a result of these scares. In a time of such consumer uncertainty, it is crucial that any new legislation would be set out in such a way as to reassure the consumer that no stone will be left unturned in an effort to guarantee safety.</P>
    <P>Our export market has also been hit by these scares and restoring confidence and ensuring a viable, thriving market will require transparency and the introduction of a seamless code of quality assurance from farm to fork. In a recent presentation, the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. David Byrne, emphasised the need for legislation which would cover the entire food chain from stable to table or from farm to fork. This Bill is restricted to dealing only with the primary production of beef and the processing of feedstuffs while ignoring the major importance of the product's safety once it moves away from primary production. Food producers realise that their reputations depend on those who precede and follow them in the food chain. Further processing, transport, wholesale and retail marketing, handling and catering industries and consumers in the home are all critical links in the food safety chain. The Bill should be extended to include these critical points.</P>
    <P>Beef cattle are a reservoir for several of the most important food borne disease agents including salmonella, campylobacter and e.coli 0157. These agents seldom produce signs of disease in the animal which would be noted by the traditional ante or post-mortem inspection. For example, e.coli 0157 is not a cattle pathogen but it is one of many gut flora normally harboured by cattle and which causes serious illness in humans. The Bill does not make any reference to the microbiological safety of the primary product. The principles of HACCP, namely hazard analysis and critical control points systems are glaringly omitted from the Bill. This concept underpins the principle of safe food for the consumer. This system, based on the principle of excluding hazards from food in the first instance, will be wasted if the process is not carried through to the point of consumption. Recently, in the United States, a huge consignment of minced beef was withdrawn from the market because e.coli 0157 was detected in the raw product. There was no actual outbreak of food poisoning in this instance but the detection of e.coli 0157 was considered to be sufficiently serious to recall the product. What is the <Col N="566" /> point of a scheme which ignores the first principle of HACCP by running the risk of allowing such bacteria to be present in the first instance?</P>
    <P>The food industry, including the beef industry, has a huge interest in restoring consumer confidence. The industry which has been plagued by scares, outbreaks of food poisoning and various horror stories about residues, must be allowed the opportunity to ensure the restoration of full confidence and must be seen to be able to operate to the highest standards. The beef industry, more than any other, has been badly hit by these scares. BSE and its link, however tenuous, to CJD and outbreaks of food poisoning from various sources has damaged the reputation of the beef industry. As a consequence of BSE, specifically, and, to a lesser extent, due to the incidence of e.coli 0157, the consumption of beef has dropped significantly. Trade restrictions by third countries have also damaged the beef market.</P>
    <P>It is the consumer who has ownership of food safety. Consumer expectations have increased dramatically in the last decade. Safe and high quality food is now the expectation of the consumer. The consumer pays the premium price for the product and, therefore, rightly expects that food offered for sale meets the highest level of safety and quality. The consumer also has the purchasing power and now has the greatest choice ever in terms of the range of foodstuffs available in the supermarket, including an enormous range of exotic and interesting imported foods. For example, by voting with their cheque books and transferring their allegiance to alternative sources of protein in their diet, consumers may be the arbiter of the success of the industry. Consequently, the response to the consumer needs to be given the highest priority and the Bill needs to be reviewed to take account of the importance of the entire food chain and not just one or two narrow links, such as primary production and feedstuffs.</P>
    <P>The stated aim of the Bill is to regulate primary production and processing, grading and handling of meat. Nevertheless, it fails to address the issues that would normally apply to the processing of foodstuffs. These concerns are within the control of the Minister for Health and Children and are outside the scope of the Bill. Once again, a number of different agencies and Departments are responsible for different aspects of food safety. It does not correlate well with the concept of a seamless process of food safety from farm to fork. For the producer of the primary product the beef assurance scheme applies, while the retail sector is totally excluded from the Bill and is under the banner of an entirely separate agency.</P>
    <P>The facility of tracing of foodstuff from farm to fork is now an expectation of the consumer. The tagging of cattle and their movements is just one narrow aspect of this. The process of tracing must continue from primary production and must ultimately reach the level where it is possible to trace every fillet of steak and every pound of mince to its farm and animal of origin. Such systems are <Col N="567" /> already available. They are complex and may be difficult to put in place but it is essential we address that problem. Outbreaks of BSE, bacterial food poisoning and residues in meat have seriously damaged confidence and it will only be restored if it can be shown it is possible for the customer to follow the trail from the producer, including the origins of the animal feed, to the point of serving the cooked product.</P>
    <P>For the traceability of the system to operate effectively there must first be in place a fully operated, computerised cattle monitoring system. Without the full and effective implementation of this part of the process, the entire principle of traceability will flounder. The outcome will be a half baked attempt to implement a process which, if improperly or inadequately applied, will do more harm than good and, in the meantime, much time and money would have been wasted.</P>
    <P>The Bill only deals with beef produced on the home market. From a consumer point of view it could be interpreted that the export market is once again perceived at least to be of greater importance to us than the health of the customers and consumers at home. The traceability scheme outlined in the Bill does not include any assurances about the safety of imported beef. Why should producers of Irish beef be expected to meet the rigorous standards set out in the Bill when their competitors who import beef are not required to meet them? This approach suggests that the cosmetic effect is even more important than the substantive matter of food safety for all that should be applied in a consistent and vigorous way throughout the food chain. It is totally inconsistent to apply a different set of rules to home produced and imported products. More importantly, this inconsistency leaves scope for placing an inferior quality imported product on the home market.</P>
    <P>The definitions section refers to animals or feedingstuff imported into the State. However, no reference is made to the implementation of legislation to take account of controls or traceability of imported products. At a minimum a certification process with backup documentation is required. Who will order the production facilities, trace the tagging system and inspect the carcases from animals in third countries? It appears that one set of rules will apply to Irish beef while another set, or perhaps none, will apply to imported animals, carcases or meat.</P>
    <P>The integrity of the food chain from farmer to processor, retailer and end user is now a dominant issue in the food industry. It is a formidable challenge to be able to trace the mincemeat in the butchers back to the original farm of origin, but it must be faced. It happens with other products on the market. For example, car or washing machine components can be traced to the original supplier. It is a reasonable expectation to do the same with food.</P>
    <P>Many sophisticated systems are now available for the complete tracing from animal to finished <Col N="568" /> product. As free trade and open markets continue to develop, a system of identification across international boundaries becomes necessary. Current differences in safety regulations and production methods among our trading partners are sure to result in problems. Potential problems with animal diseases in a country may result as a consequence of free trade. Animals may be slaughtered and shipped all over the world and those coming into a country should be identifiable through any system that is applied. Imported foods that make specific claims should be verifiable through a reliable system. It is a major weakness of the Bill if imported products are not subject to the same levels of assurance as home produced commodities.</P>
    <P>As a means of restoring credibility in any system, one of the first requirements is the independence of the system. Monitoring of the system must in the first instance be seen to be independent and be underpinned by sound scientific principles. Precedents have been set by the Food Safety Authority in relation to the application of the hazard analysis to a critical control points system in other areas of the food industry. It is not the food industry that inspects, but an independent inspectorate.</P>
    <P>What plans are in place for the auditing of the national beef assurance scheme? Who will have responsibility for carrying out the inspection at farm and factory levels and at feedingstuff manufacture? All the professionals involved in auditing the beef industry should have a basic and common food safety management audit training and experience, preferably to a recognised international standard. Once again, the importance of follow through by the inspectorate, from raw material to finished product, is of the utmost importance to ensure continuity and consistency in the inspecting process.</P>
    <P>Severe penalties are to be imposed on those who fail to meet the requirements of the Bill. The lack of any level of grading of breaches under the terms of the legislation means that all breaches, major or minor, are possibly open to the same level of penalty. This means that the same penalty will be applied even where the breach may be accidental or of relatively minor significance. The Minister referred to this, but it would be more reassuring if the scale of penalties was spelt out in greater detail in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Where participants are found to be non-compliant with the conditions they will be informed of the steps to be taken to bring them into compliance. Continued non-compliance will result in notice of the Minister's intention to refuse or revoke approval and they will have an opportunity to make representations to him. In addition, there will be provision for an appeals procedure to the courts in the event of refusal or revocation.</P>
    <P>However, the only recourse in appealing a decision is through the courts, which will inevitably be a lengthy and expensive process and it will not be an option for many small operators. <Col N="569" /> An independent appeals system, comparable to that of an ombudsman, should be considered to speed up the appeals process and to avoid the heavy costs that would inevitably be incurred if recourse to the courts became the only route open for appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister will allow a participant to continue to supply product pending an appeal provided he does not consider the supplier to be a danger to public health. For what reason, other than public safety, would the Minister revoke a licence? If the licence is revoked it must surely mean the participant is in serious breach of the regulations and the idea of an appeal being tolerated while he is still in business is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the period of the validity of a licence will be open ended. It would appear from this that once an inspection is carried out and a certificate issued the farmer no longer needs to be concerned about maintaining the standards. Spot checks on the process would be the only way to ensure that standards will be maintained, otherwise the farmer will have no incentive to maintain the standard and the system will disintegrate, leaving an ever worse state of affairs. While the Bill allows for reinspection there is no indication of its frequency or regularity.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of the legislation will be the need for the documentation and production of a paper trail by each farmer to show they have complied with requirements. However, the beef assurance scheme should not become a paper chase with attendent costs for the participant, nor should it become a public relations panacea, where there is an idea that once the paperwork is done, the rest will take care of itself. Very often, reducing the paperwork and increasing the level of inspection will be much more productive. While at farm level there are commercial concerns and the fear of bureaucracy, the assurance scheme should not be driven by either of these considerations.</P>
    <P>Provision for the manufacture and trade in feeding stuffs poses enormous problems for the beef industry if conditions are not adhered to. Is the inspectorate for meat production and feeding stuff production the same inspectorate? What training is envisaged for each of these areas? The processes and procedures for inspection will differ greatly in each case. Separate skills and competencies will be required for the proper execution of each of these tasks. I have already referred to the need for a specialist trained independent inspectorate and I emphasise it again, bearing in mind the differences in training required for the inspection at farm level and the requirements of inspecting a food processing unit. The importance of the management and control of feeding stuff production and processing does not need to be spelt out. BSE is the benchmark for all of us relating to changes in process without due consideration of the implications. The former Minister for Health and Children referred yesterday to the post-BSE era and as I said already, <Col N="570" /> unfortunately we are not in a post-BSE era. It is still with us. The bulk of the scientific evidence supports the theory of BSE on the basis of a change in the process for the production of meat and bonemeal. Processors opted to reduce the heat treatment of the raw material while at the same time removing the use of an organic solvent from the extraction process. These two cost-cutting procedures resulted in what was to become the greatest threat to the beef industry in Europe this century and last century. The consequence of these procedures was that the prion protein, which was considered to be the causative agent of BSE, survived the milder processing.</P>
    <P>The actual processing of animal feedstuffs must be policed rigorously to ensure that there is not ever again a risk of another BSE type incident. Technical requirements relating to monitoring the heating process and ensuring the maintenance of the correct temperatures for a sufficient length of time are essential for ensuring confidence in this sector of the industry. Employment of suitably qualified technical and scientific personnel to ensure the effectiveness of these operations will be required to restore confidence in the process. I urge that scientists employed in this area be adequately rewarded for their very responsible role in such industries.</P>
    <P>Post-process contamination of feeding stuff following heat treatment is an aspect of the process that requires vigilance to ensure that the microbial contamination is avoided. Opportunities for cross-contamination between raw and processed feeding stuff, as well as packaging, storage and transport conditions must all be rigorously policed to ensure the continuity of the safety elements of the process. This point brings me back to the consideration of the need for a HACCP procedure in trying to apply a beef assurance scheme. It requires just one weak link in the chain and all the efforts will have been a waste of time and money. The recent catastrophe in the Belgian food industry arising from the dioxin residue in the food chain caused enormous problems for the food industry in that country. Dioxins are ubiquitous contaminants caused by the burning of hydro-carbon fuels by industry and can persist for many years in the environment. At present, beef and beef products is one category of foods which may not be imported into Ireland without an official Belgian clearance certificate of analysis of the consignment for dioxin. The Belgian dioxin incident decimated their food industry and brought down the Government. There are lessons for Ireland in this unfortunate incident. Not only should we have measures in place to protect consumer health but Ireland's green image needs to be protected by having in place a monitoring system for residues such as dioxin. One such incident could seriously damage our green image abroad as an exporter of high quality meat.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the need for consideration of our imports as well as our home produced product. Will the tracking system as set out in the Bill be <Col N="571" /> adequate to allow a rapid alert and recall of product should the need arise? In addition to the traceability required by the Bill it is essential to have a complete database and tracking system available for imported products.</P>
    <P>In farming business where legislation is introduced under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, there is always a concern that the Department will be seen both as gamekeeper and poacher. A vibrant and very effective Food Safety Authority is now in place under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children. Surely this is the agency under which the beef assurance scheme should be introduced. Among the tasks identified by the Food Safety Authority is the need for a seamless food inspection service where no gap exists in the continuum from farm to fork. The future of the beef industry will undoubtedly be influenced by the effectiveness of the beef assurance scheme. To ensure that such schemes are effective and efficient, research programmes must be introduced and maintained so that Ireland remains competitive and at the cutting edge in the technology of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The beef assurance scheme should be under the banner of the Food Safety Authority, the body charged with responsibility for food safety in Ireland, an organisation that has established an impressive track record since its introduction. By placing the responsibility with a Department other than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, it would help to avoid a conflict of interests between the marketing and policing needs of our beef industry and thus help to ensure consumer confidence at a time when hard questions continue to be put to our producers and processors. The philosophy must be one of excellence combined with the highest standards of production processing retail and catering practices.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Upton to the House. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so and I know that her late brother Pat would be here on this issue today if he was still with us. I also welcome Deputy Upton because she lectured me for four years in UCD, where I got my interest in food science and food microbiology. I hope the Minister will take note of her excellent speech which contains the kernel of the whole Bill and highlights some of its inadequacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle of this Bill. It is a route we must take but first, we have to examine the current situation in the beef sector. The beef sector is at a low ebb as was highlighted by the recent dispute outside our factories countrywide. It is crucially important that we have transparency in prices because farmers feel aggrieved that every time there is a new cost in beef production, it is passed on to the farmer yet every time there is an increase in the price of beef, the farmer does not receive it. He is the last one to get any increase. There is a huge lack of confi<Col N="572" /> dence, which must be put back into the beef sector if we are serious about developing the sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it will provide improved traceability and quality throughout the beef industry. However, there is a new approach required within the beef industry. We cannot continue to allow Holstein blood into our beef cattle if we are serious about having a proper beef herd without letting dairy cattle into it and producing poor quality animals. The Minister might say that in his neck of the woods there are many of the dairy farmers doing well within the beef sector as well. They are either beef or dairy producers &ndash; realistically, they cannot be both. The type of funding coming from the EU is related to the animal's ear rather then the quality of the animal. Once one has an animal that can stand on its four legs with tags in both ears, one can get the subsidies. Once the second subsidy is received, they are sent to the factory and anything they receive there is a bonus. This is the current situation within our so-called beef industry. If we are serious about developing a beef industry, that situation cannot and must not continue. Ringer bulls are being used to service cows which should not be in the system, cows which should have been slaughtered long ago.</P>
    <P>We have the same situation again in relation to extensification, the negotiations for Agenda 2000, and the lack of any positive step in the sheep industry. This will put huge pressure on the beef industry as farmers will weigh things up, see they are getting nothing for sheep and will be penalised for having them in terms of extensification while they can receive premia and extensification for cattle. Therefore, it will lead to further production of poor quality cattle with Holstein blood.</P>
    <P>Over Christmas I spoke to a young farmer about the beef sector. He made the point that when his father got married, one bullock would have bought a very good engagement ring. Now a young farmer would have to sell two very good bullocks before considering buying an engagement ring. This is just one example of the current position and I could stand here all evening giving other examples.</P>
    <P>Realistically Irish beef cannot compete at world prices, something which must be addressed. It is impossible for Irish beef to compete given the way the Argentineans and Australians mass produce beef. We must concentrate on our advantages. We have small holdings which are easy to manage and we can produce a high quality animal from grass, something no other country can do and something we must highlight.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking to the Egyptian ambassador approximately two years ago when we were discussing the opening of the live export market to Egypt. At that time Egypt was shipping in cattle from Australia, something it is still doing. The cattle are inferior and harder to manage and control because they are raised on thousand acre farms and do not even know what humans look like. Quite a number of handlers in Egypt have <Col N="573" /> been killed by being gouged by the horns of these cattle. There are also huge losses on the ships because the standards are not as high as those in Ireland and the journey is further and more turbulent. We have a product which we must get onto the market. We must also produce a better quality product.</P>
    <P>The logic of the beef production and processing industry has been to kill the animal, bone it and ship it out. Most product is sold as carcass beef or in boxes in various cuts. Nothing further is done with it in Ireland. Beef is sent to Germany, etc., where it is processed into a high quality product. I must give credit to the dairy industry which has invested in research and development and in producing high quality products demanded by consumers &ndash; different types of cheeses, yoghurts, etc. For example, frying cheese is being produced in Sligo.</P>
    <P>However, the necessary research and development has not been carried out in the beef sector to allow the development of a high value product. We have not examined the application and potential of lactic acid bacteria in the beef sector. Lactic acid bacteria have been used for many years in our dairy industry and can be used in the beef industry, as they are in some parts of the world. For example, it can be used in certain types of beef curing for which there is a demand. We have the necessary technology and no other country can compete with the expertise we have in University College Cork and Moorepark in terms of lactic acid bacteria. We have some of the leading experts in the world in this regard yet we are sending out a low value product, rather than the high price, high value product which we should be producing for European markets where the potential exists.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Farrelly, Kirk and Owen.</P>
      <P>The closure of Hawkesbay Leisure Limited has brought devastation, fear and anger to Ardee, a very pleasant town which has been overshadowed by Dundalk and Drogheda over the years. The loss of the major employer in Ardee has been a tremendous blow to the morale of the town. There is anger that over the past 20 or 30 years not enough effort has been made to attract industry by successive Governments. With the exception of Farrell's joinery works, the town was totally dependent on Hawkesbay Leisure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the employees of Hawkesbay Leisure are the breadwinners in their families. There is fear in the town among business people that this is yet another step backwards given the contribution the workers made to the economy of Ardee. There is anger at suggestions that perhaps <Col N="574" /> all or part of this industry might move to fill the void created by Fruit of the Loom in Donegal, where the job losses are another tragedy. There is also a fear that because of the demand for workers by Xerox in Dundalk, a very welcome addition to the town, the IDA might take its foot off the accelerator in looking for a replacement industry for Ardee. Nothing less than a replacement industry will suffice for the people of Ardee and the surrounding areas. The people will exact a full penalty if sufficient efforts are not made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Over the years not enough effort was made by political parties, including Fine Gael, and I ask the Minister of State to give an assurance that the business will not be transferred in any shape or form to fill the void in Donegal. We need the industry in Ardee and we will accept nothing less than an assurance from the Minister of State in this regard. I also want him to give an assurance that the IDA will leave no stone unturned in its efforts to get a replacement industry for this fine plant which is ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>There are suggestions that perhaps a pharmaceutical company will come to Ardee. If this is so, I would welcome it and be grateful for it, as will everybody else in County Louth. Nevertheless, that is for the future, and while it might be reassuring for the people of Ardee, the only assurance I am seeking from the Minister of State is a guarantee that this plant will not manifest itself in Donegal in any form in the future and that the IDA will place the same emphasis on seeking a replacement industry as it has on finding a replacement for Fruit of the Loom in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to contribute to the debate. Up to 50 employees of Hawkesbay reside in my constituency and its closure was a devastating blow to the area. I do not want the Minister of State to tell us that the IDA has secured a factory on lands that the North-Eastern Health Board held on to and then sold to the IDA even though it wanted them for Ardee and the surrounding area. It is a devastating loss and I ask the Minister of State to put a task force in place in conjunction with the Ardee Chamber of Commerce and the urban council to pressure the IDA to find an alternative industry for that modern complex. In addition, I concur with Deputy McGahon regarding the owners of Hawkesbay. We do not want them to set up in Donegal with the help of the IDA, as has been stated. I want the Minister to state that is not the case. A task force is required following the loss of 300 jobs in this area where many young people have built homes and taken out mortgages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon, for giving me the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate. The closure of the Hawkesbay plant has been a devastating blow to Ardee as it was the major industry <Col N="575" /> there. The workforce was drawn not only from Ardee, but also from south Monaghan and north Meath and it was a significant industry for that region. Hawkesbay took over from Lee Jeans when it bought the company out in 1998. There has been a long tradition of textile manufacturing in Ardee and the skill base is quite significant. Hawkesbay ran a single product plant and that is problematic for any operation if difficulties arise in the marketplace. The explanation proffered was that because of fashion changes in the marketplace demand has fallen for the jeans that were manufactured there and, consequently, the need for the Hawkesbay manufacturing operation in Ardee has been diminished.</P>
      <P>The company bought the Fruit of the Loom plant in Raphoe, County Donegal, and all of us are aware of the difficulties that were experienced there. It is important that a transparent explanation is given to the people of Ardee for this move. Every effort has been made to attract industry to the town. It has an unfortunately chequered history, but Galen Holdings, which is a significant pharmaceutical firm in Northern Ireland, indicated at its annual general meeting two months ago that it planned to invest in the town. Deputy Farrelly, who is a member of the North-Eastern Health Board, will be aware that a 50 to 60 acre farm in Ardee has been sold for industrial development purposes.</P>
      <P>We want the Galen Holdings project fast tracked as an indication of the Government's commitment to the local economy. Hawkesbay has been at the heart of this economy and a replacement industry is needed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I share fully their disappointment at the announcement of the closure of the Hawkesbay plant. Hawkesbay Apparel Inc. was established in Toronto, Canada, in 1975 to produce jeans and jackets for the US market. The company is owned by the Valliani family and operates two plants in Pakistan and Dubai, employing 800 people. In early 1998, Hawkesbay acquired the Vanity Fair plants at Ardee, Derry and Newtownards and continued to produce Lee and Wrangler jeans, for the European market for VF under contract. However, the Ardee facility experienced major labour turnover problems and found it difficult to find replacement staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, on 5 January 2000, Hawkesbay Apparel Inc. announced that it was to close its Ardee facility, which will result in the loss of 280 jobs. The unit is to close on 4 February. The company also announced that a total of 160 people will be made redundant at Newtownards and Derry. The closure of the Ardee plant and the redundancies in Northern Ireland are a direct result of the loss of the contract with VF Corporation to produce Lee and Wrangler jeans for the <Col N="576" /> European market. This contract was the mainstay of the company's production in Ireland, North and South, for the past two years and its loss is a result of continued decline in market demand for VF jeans in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senior officials in my Department and the development agencies met representatives of the workforce and trade union representatives soon after the closure announcement. It was explained that neither the IDA nor the Department had any prior notice of the decision to close the plant. While there was no possibility of a postponement or a reversal of the decision, the worker representatives were assured that the development agencies, would do everything possible to find alternative employment for the workers affected.</P>
    <P>FÁS has been actively involved with the company since the closure announcement. FÁS staff have visited the Hawkesbay plant and have registered 170 of the workers. It is setting up a dedicated computer tracking system for the Hawkesbay workers which will maintain details of their skills and training needs and will also facilitate the matching of the jobs skills of staff with potential employment opportunities in companies in their area. FÁS is currently going to tender for the provision of a computer training course which will be held in Ardee and a keen interest in computer training was expressed by the Hawkesbay workers.</P>
    <P>A recruitment fair has also been held in the Hawkesbay plant which was attended by up to ten companies, including two recruitment agencies. In addition, companies which were not represented at the fair have been in touch with FÁS and the company about job opportunities. The IDA is in constant ongoing negotiations with a specific client in regard to a greenfield site in Ardee. In September 1999, the IDA agreed to the sale of the Fruit of the Loom plant in Raphoe, County Donegal, to Hawkesbay on the basis of a business plan to produce clothing for a number of smaller fashion designer branded companies along with department and chain stores. The contract for sale was closed before the announcement that Hawkesbay was to close. The IDA is still in discussions with Hawkesbay regarding its future plans for Raphoe.</P>

      <P>The IDA's policy is clear. It supports foreign direct investment in Ireland and provides facilities, opportunities and incentives for investment in particular locations commensurate with the interests, needs of the client and market opportunities. The Deputy can be absolutely certain that we have no desire to, nor will State agencies, assist companies to relocate from one region to another. Upon procurement of an asset by any company, nobody has the right to prevent it from going into production, even without State aid if it so desires. We are not the final arbiters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, the Louth region has both shared in and contributed to major economic growth in <Col N="577" /> Ireland and has seen tremendous development in recent times. While the job loss announcement in Ardee, is clearly a major blow to the workforce, employment prospects generally are positive in County Louth at present. Xerox is in the process of developing a major technology park in Dundalk, the construction of which is well advanced. I visited the site and it will be a model for future investment here. Xerox has already recruited 285 people, with the number of jobs set to increase to 2,100 by the end of 2003. Xerox has already had a major impact in Dundalk, both in terms of investment and in increasing business confidence in the area and the company has already developed strong links with the Dundalk Institute of Technology and the local chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>In another significant development, ICL, one of the world's leading IT companies, is to establish a 160 job software centre in Dundalk which will specialise in the implementation and development of software applications based on Oracle technology. This new centre will employ more than 100 software developers within three years, consisting of highly skilled, high technology third level graduates. Since its start up in May 1999 ICL has already recruited 30 people. I assure the Deputies and all other colleagues that the State agencies will give every assistance to the employees at Hawkesbay to find new employment and we are hopeful that the generally very positive situation in County Louth will lead to early re-employment for the people affected by this unexpected closure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. Local authorities are now in the process of establishing strategic policy committees which will include councillors and representatives of community, voluntary, disadvantaged, environmental and cultural organisations in a new committee structure. The SPCs will consider council policy on a range of areas &ndash; housing, planning, transportation, amenities and so on &ndash; and will advise the council on those policy areas. In addition, the chairpersons of the SPCs who will be councillors will, together with the chairperson of the council or the mayor, constitute a corporate policy group within each council which will function as a kind of council cabinet which, among other things, will have very signifi-<Col N="578" /> cant powers including the preparation of the council's draft estimates.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind these new structures was based on the idea of partnership and inclusiveness, partnership between the council and the wider community and inclusiveness of all the political interests on the council. The Minister, to underwrite that, issued guidelines on how the council should be elected and specifically on how the chairs of these SPCs should be elected. The guidelines state:</P>
      <P>SPC councillor membership should reflect the proportionality and distribution of elected representation on the full council. The allocation of SPC chairs should also reflect equitably the spread of elected representation on the council. The points made above as to good will and fair play are equally relevant here. However, where agreement in this regard is not possible the group of SPC chairs to be appointed should technically be treated for appointment purposes as if it constituted a separate committee to ensure an equal spread of representation as SPC chairs.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister intend to do in a case where a council decides to throw out the window and elect SPC chairs based on crude majoritarianism? A meeting of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on 13 December last decided to elect the chairs of the SPCs. Arising from the Minister's guidelines the Labour Party proposed that the election of the SPC chairs should be carried out under the group voting system. That proposal was defeated on a vote of 19 to six. There then followed a succession of five votes for each of the five SPC chair positions which also resulted in a vote of 19 to six, in each case the losing candidate being the Labour nominee and on the opposite side a combination of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats. This kind of political grab-all would do justice to the old Stormont regime. The effect on this council is that the Labour and single Green Party representative constitute 25% of the entire membership of the council and have been excluded from participation both on the SPC chairs and on the corporate policy group.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to deal particularly with the position in an individual council but the advice the council was given was that, so far, the chairs of the SPCs have not been designated under section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1985 for the purposes of group voting. While the guidelines which the Minister issued states there should be group voting the legal position is that that cannot be given effect because it has not been designated so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister assure the House that he will make an order to designate the chairs and, indeed, the formation of SPCs for the purposes of the group voting system that was provided for under section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1985? Otherwise I fear that in other councils <Col N="579" /> there will be a repeat of the greedy grab-all that took place in this council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The introduction of local authority strategic policy committees is a new and exciting way of strengthening the councillor's role and that of the local community in developing council policy. Central to the success of the SPCs is a partnership approach between councillors, local sectoral interests and local authority management.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been engaged in an intensive consultative process with relevant interests on the programme of local government renewal. As part of these consultations, the Minister established a working group, representative of local government, the social partners, the Institute of Public Administration and his Department, to draw up revised guidelines for the establishment and operation of the new SPCs following the local elections in June 1999.</P>
      <P>In taking his decision to set up the working group the Minister was conscious of the need to ensure that the SPCs were established and operated on a partnership basis. That is why the composition of the group was representative of as many relevant interests as possible. That is why the working group in turn engaged in an extensive consultation process in drawing up its report and why the guidelines explicitly deal with the need for fair play in the allocation of SPC chairs and SPC membership.</P>
      <P>Chapter 6 of the guidelines goes into some detail about the need and desirability for the allocation of SPC chairs to reflect equitably the spread of elected representation on the council. The guidelines specifically underline the importance of local authorities adopting and implementing, and that they are clearly seen by the public to do so, an approach that ensures the various political and other interests represented on the full council are treated fairly. The guidelines go further and say that where agreement on the allocation of SPC chairs is not possible, the group of SPC chairs to be appointed should technically be treated as a group for appointment purposes under section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1985 to ensure an equitable spread of representation. The section 27 provisions were designed to allow a basic element of proportionality in appointments by local authorities to committees and other bodies. However, many local authorities, even prior to that Act, operated and continue, as they are entitled under the Act, to operate their own local and more finely developed arrangements to ensure fair play for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the 1985 Act the Minister and his prede<Col N="580" /> cessors have called on and exhorted councils to make appointments in an equitable fashion. The need for such equity has been especially underlined in the case of the SPCs. Even as recently as last June the Minister made regulations under the 1985 Act applying the principles of the section 27 procedures to appointments by local authorities to a range of bodies such as LEADER groups and county enterprise boards which have emerged since the passing of the 1985 Act.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out to the Deputy that the selection of SPC chairs is, in the end, an operational matter for the local authority concerned and that ultimately it is probably impossible to legislate fully for good will and fair play. It is the electorate who are the final judge in such matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, however, prepared to look at any specific proposal Deputies put forward to improve the current legislative arrangements in the context of the forthcoming local government Bill.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister is present to answer this question. It concerns him as well as other Oireachtas Members in the county. The road network in Kerry, in common with most counties, is extensive by any standards of measurement and provides a more dense road network than any other European country. For example, the road length per 1,000 of population in Germany is 8 km, in England it is 6 km and in France it is 15 km. In Ireland it is 26 km and in Kerry it is 26.8 km.</P>
      <P>The network of non-national roads is an infrastructural feature crucial to the economic and social development of the county, and it is considered imperative that it is maintained to a good standard to provide a safe and efficient service to residents and visitors alike. Over two million tourists come to Kerry every year and many of our main tourist attractions are on national roads.</P>
      <P>There are 3,807 kilometres of local roads in Kerry, and a recent study by the Department of the Environment and Local Government indicated that it would cost £13.3 million to bring the local primary roads up to an appropriate standard. To bring the local secondary roads up to standard would cost £11.7 million and in respect of the local tertiary roads the cost would be £13.3 million. Overall, to bring our local road network up to standard would cost just over £38 million.</P>
      <P>We have 448 kilometres of regional roads in Kerry. The same study by the Department of the Environment and Local Government considered that £7 million would be required to bring those roads up to an appropriate standard. The total length of non-national roads in Kerry is 4,255 kilometres and, according to the Department of the Environment and Local Government figure, it would take £45 million to bring them up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry County Council has a five year programme. I appeal to the Minister to provide the <Col N="581" /> necessary front-loaded funding next Monday, when he is due to make an announcement, to accelerate that programme which hopefully will cover two years in the first year. It is generally accepted that 1979 was the last year in which a satisfactory maintenance programme was provided for non-national roads in Kerry. The amount provided then was £1.63 million, £6.5 million in today's terms. This year, Kerry County Council has a budget of £1.87 million to spend on road maintenance. Compared to 1979, when we spent the equivalent of £6.5 million, this year we will spend £1.87 and as a result much of the good work done over the past five years is being destroyed because of lack of maintenance. Roads have to be maintained as well as strengthened, but we do not have the resources to do that.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the Minister that since 1 December, over 14 inches of rain has fallen in Kerry. Statistics for the last century show that Kerry had the highest amounts of rainfall in the country. As a result of those high levels of rainfall, the natural terrain and underlying condition of our roads, we face a specific problem in the county. We also had very heavy frost in recent weeks and, coupled with the heavy rainfall, our roads are now in a deplorable condition. The Minister of State will be aware of that because no doubt he travels on them every day. The county engineer has estimated that damage amounting to over £300,000 has been caused to our roads since December alone and he will spend £200,000 in the next few weeks on fire brigade action just to repair the potholes. In many cases, repairing potholes is a waste of money.</P>
    <P>In 1979, 81% of non-national road network funding was provided by the council from its own resources. However, the Department of the Environment and Local Government now provides over 85% of the funding. Since domestic rates were abolished, Kerry County Council is almost totally dependent on the Department to provide funding for both maintenance and strengthening of our county roads. The dependence on the Department of the Environment and Local Government for funding for the non-national road network has resulted in an over-emphasis on strengthening the more important routes, as laid out in the five year plan, and a considerable reduction in the discretion of the county council in spending this allocation.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, a major strengthening programme has been carried out and improvements have been made on our road network but many of those improvements have been destroyed by the weather conditions. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember when there was a specific problem in Cavan. We have the same problem in Kerry, and Kerry could be termed the pothole county of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask that Kerry will get preferential treatment next Monday when the Minister announces the allocation for non-national roads. Due to the unique conditions Kerry experiences, money should be given to us to solve the problem. I do <Col N="582" /> not want to exaggerate too much but we are experiencing major difficulty in Kerry and it is being expressed in various ways. People are getting very frustrated. They are taking to the roads to protest, as highlighted recently on our television screens. I appeal to the Minister of State to try to do something about this problem and to the Minister from County Kerry to use his influence to ensure we get an allocation that can solve our problems next Monday.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be here to respond and he has asked me to do so on his behalf. Before turning to the specific case of Kerry, I would like to say a few words about non-national roads in general.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the provision for non-national roads in 1999 was £237 million, an increase of over £37 million or nearly 19% on the original 1998 allocation figure of almost £200 million. In making this provision, the Minister was fulfilling one of the Government's key commitments for non-national roads, namely, to ensure additional funding.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme, which began in 1995&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and aims to restore the entire network of regional and local roads in county areas by 2005, continues to be the cutting edge of the non-national roads effort and the Minister increased the funds available for this programme from over £20 million in 1995 to over £138 million last year. This provision greatly increased the rate of progress being made in the restoration of regional and county roads to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>The 1999 allocations meant that, on average, county councils received over £2,400 for every kilometre of non-national road. Furthermore, county councils received significantly increased grants for maintenance work in 1999. Maintenance grants under the restoration programme increased by 36% to £31.7 million, while discretionary maintenance grants increased by almost 32% to £12.8 million. This is further evidence of the Government's determination to deal with the problems of regional and county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, he will be aware that the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in its area is a matter for Kerry County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by grants made available by the Department. Kerry County Council was allocated a total of £10.77 million for 1999, a figure which represents an increase of 23% on the initial 1998 allocation to the council of £8.761 million. In fact, total main<Col N="583" /> tenance grants in 1999 to the council increased by a massive 34% to over £2.1 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to which the various grant categories should be applied is a matter for Kerry County Council, subject to the general guidelines issued by the Department. In this regard, the Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads 1996-1999 specifically reminds local authorities that the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from their own resources, supplemented by grants, and that they should set aside a contingency sum to finance any restoration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions. I should mention that Kerry County Council has spent over £2.16 million of its own resources in 1999 on non-national roads.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will agree that the foregoing represents a reasonable approach with significantly increased grants available to Kerry County Council in 1999, including significantly increased maintenance grants. In total the council has had nearly £13 million available to it in 1999 for non-national roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister will announce the 2000 non-national road allocations for local authorities next Monday, 31 January. I assure the Deputy that flexibility will be shown by the Department in considering any request from the council for necessary adjustments to its multi-annual restoration programme arising from storm damage to particular roads. In determining the 2000 grants, the Minister will ensure that the increased resources available will equip all authorities appropriately, including Kerry County Council, in relation to its ongoing and special needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing a debate on this matter on the Adjournment. I am very conscious of the sensitivities involved here. There is a serious case still before the courts and I certainly have no views on the guilt or innocence of the accused person nor do I intend to comment in any way on any of the evidence heard by the court.</P>
      <P>However, it is a matter of the utmost concern that a major trial of this nature should have been caused to collapse, reportedly because discussions of the jury could be overheard in the public gallery of the court. This was the ninth day of this major trial. One can only guess at the cost in terms of the time of the lawyers, court officials, gardaí and others, money which has now been effectively wasted as a result of this incident. The time and commitment of the members of the jury have &ndash; through no fault of their own &ndash; also been wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the judge acted properly in dis<Col N="584" /> charging the jury and probably had no alternative once the matter was drawn to her attention. However, it is alarming that this could have happened; the danger of it happening should have been foreseen and it is absolutely essential that steps should be taken to ensure it never happens again.</P>
    <P>The confidentiality of the jury room is sacrosanct. It is already difficult to get people to serve on juries; what chance will there be to get people to serve if they fear that the views they express in the jury room could be overheard? In the recent past there has been a number of very high profile jury trials involving senior gangland figures on serious charges. If the deliberations had been overheard in a case like that it would have left identifiable jury members open to threats, intimidation or even retribution. Of course, we have no way of knowing for certain whether discussions of previous juries may have been overheard.</P>
    <P>From what we know of the circumstances of this case, it appears that a fire door was installed in the jury room which opened on to the public gallery. The gallery was apparently only being used because of the particular interest in this case and it was only then that it was discovered conversations could be overheard. Surely it should be standard procedure that where alterations are made to a jury room, tests are carried out to check if the changes have had any impact on the security of the room.</P>
    <P>This incident again highlights the totally inadequate condition of many of our courtrooms. The Four Courts is a magnificent building to look at with a wonderfully impressive Round Hall, but the conditions in many of the individual courtrooms are Dickensian. During this particular case there was considerable comment about the discomfort in the courtroom caused by the heat due to overcrowding. There was a power cut in the Four Courts complex shortly before Christmas as a result of the overloading of the electricity supply and a distinguished High Court judge subsequently announced that he was going home and was going to stay there because there was no heating in his chambers.</P>
    <P>The Four Courts is in the luxury category compared to some court buildings around the country. Leaking, draughty, insanitary and rodent infested buildings are too much the norm. The Court Services Board is still in its infancy. It has impressive plans to improve the efficiency of the courts, including improving the flow of information through the Internet, but one of its first priorities must be to embark on an intensive programme of improvement of courtrooms and court buildings.</P>
    <P>This case also focuses attention on the way jurors are treated. Being asked to determine guilt or innocence in serious criminal cases is an enormous burden to carry. We should at a minimum try to ensure that they are allowed to do their duty in conditions of safety and comfort.</P>
    <P>It is getting difficult to get people to serve on <Col N="585" /> juries. This is understandable. Jurors can be asked to commit several weeks of their time. It can lead to disruption of personal lives and cause work problems. Those who can avoid jury service usually do so. This is not desirable as it can lead to juries who are not representative of society generally.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people who served on juries in the Central Criminal Court who said that when they were called for the initial jury empanelling, hundreds of potential jurors were crammed into a tiny courtroom waiting to see if their names would be called. People who would be later called to serve on a jury were in some cases crammed up against people they would later be trying. In another case I was told of jury members being put into a tiny room which was already crammed full of boxes of dusty documents and filing cabinets, where they had to spend long hours &ndash; not just when they were making their decision but also during prolonged legal arguments in their absence. At least jurors in criminal cases get their lunch at the expense of the State. Those serving as jurors in civil cases do not even get the price of a bag of crisps.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to ensure that a full investigation is held into how this particular incident was allowed to happen; that steps are taken to ensure it never happens again; that a review of all courts and jury rooms is carried out and that we look at the way in which we treat jury members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to point out that the trial proceedings affected by this incident are still ongoing and I am very conscious of the need to be mindful of that fact in dealing with the matter before the House.</P>
      <P>This matter comes within the responsibility of the Courts Service, which I established on 9 November 1999 to carry out a variety of functions related to the courts, including the administration of the courts and the provision, management and maintenance of court buildings. I have asked the Courts Service for a report on this incident and I have received a preliminary account on foot of which I have requested that a full and comprehensive investigation be carried out into this matter. I am quite prepared to make a further report to the House in due course at a more appropriate time should the House wish me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Courts Service about the circumstances which led to the incident. The trial in question was being heard in court 3 and commenced on 12 January. On Tuesday, 25 January, after the hearing had finished for the day, a court usher brought to the attention of the Court Registrar that persons sitting in the overflow public gallery in the balcony of the courtroom could hear muffled voices from the jury room. I am informed that what were heard were muffled voices. The Court Registrar immediately directed that the gallery be closed to the public. The following morning, 26 January, the Court <Col N="586" /> Registrar notified the presiding judge, Hon. Miss Justice Mella Carroll. When the court resumed counsel for the prosecution requested the judge to open the overflow public gallery to accommodate witnesses and the judge so directed. On resuming after lunch the judge requested counsel for both sides to meet with her in her chambers. Following this meeting the judge returned to court and discharged the jury and instructed them not to discuss the case with the media.</P>
    <P>When a new jury is empanelled the case will be tried in court 4, the jury room of which is not in proximity to an area to which the public has access.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service carried out an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding the situation whereby it was possible to hear sounds from the jury room. The overflow public gallery in court 3 had been closed since the early 1970s and by and large remains closed to the general public. The overflow public gallery in Court 3 was opened in this case because of the large number of witnesses and the very significant public interest in the case. Usually the public are accommodated in the general body of the courtroom.</P>
    <P>For health and safety reasons a major refurbishment of the Four Courts was undertaken between 1994 and 1996 and, as part of this work, on the recommendation of the Office of Public Works, an emergency exit, involving heavy fireproof doors, for the rooms attached to courts 2 and 3 was installed at one end of the overflow public galleries. I am informed that immediate steps are now being taken to ensure that the soundproofing of these doors is adequate to guarantee the confidentiality of jury deliberations and the privacy of jury discussions. In the interim the overflow public galleries in courts 2 and 3 will remain closed.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost to the State, this is directly related to the number of days sitting and the legal fees payable by the State in addition to the time and other costs of the members of the Garda Síochána, court officers and other expenses involved in this case. Before the discharge of the jury the case was at hearing for 11 days. It is difficult at this stage to estimate the cost of the aborted trial but I hope to be in a position to provide more information to the House on this aspect in due course.</P>
    <P>Following discussions between officials of my Department and the Courts Service, I am assured that the Courts Service is taking all necessary steps to ensure that there will be no recurrence of the events which led to the collapse of this trial. While from time to time juries have been discharged, the House will be well aware that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way on the conduct or decision of any individual court case which is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. We are, of course, always grateful to people who serve on <Col N="587" /> juries. It can be very inconvenient for people to have to sit for days on end on a jury, but jury service is a civic duty and to that extent it is compulsory. Nonetheless it is very important that, in the course of a trial, accommodation is made <Col N="588" /> available so that juries do not have to sit in the conditions described by Deputy Howlin. I assure the House that I will do all I can to ensure that juries are treated as they are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 2 February 2000.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many approved pension schemes encourage early retirement in the sense that persons who have completed their required years for pension eligibility who continue working do not qualify for any additional pension entitlement on the basis of the extra contributions they are required to make in that period; his views on whether this is satisfactory from an equity and incentive point of view; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1866/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): In considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes it must be borne in mind that such schemes are voluntary arrangements usually introduced by employers following consultation with their employees.</P>
    <P>I should point out that a distinction needs to be made between defined benefit and defined contribution occupational pension schemes. Under defined contribution arrangements pension at retirement is determined by the accumulated value of contributions paid and the return from investment of those contributions, whereas in defined benefit schemes the pension payable is linked to salary at retirement.</P>
    <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to research carried out by the ESRI in 1995 which indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that about 60% of members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes have their pension determined by their pensionable pay in the year before retirement and the remainder have it determined on the basis of average pensionable pay in the three years preceding retirement or some other basis; and the rate at which pension benefits are built up is 1/60th of final pay for each year of service, subject to a maximum of 40/60ths of final pay.</P>
    <P>From this, it can be seen that it is not normally in a person's interests to retire early where the rules of the occupational scheme provide for such early retirement as in general the longer a person remains in employment the higher his or her final salary will be resulting in a higher rate of occupational pension.</P>
    <P>While I am generally satisfied that where occupational pension schemes are provided by employers they operate to the advantage of employees, I am concerned that the level of supplementary pension coverage &ndash; at 50% of those at work &ndash; is too low. The Pensions Board, in their report on the national pensions policy initiative, recommended that a target of 70% of the workforce over age 30 should have supplementary pension coverage. To achieve this target, the board recommended the introduction of a new pension savings vehicle, a personal retirement savings account. The board envisaged that <Col N="590" /> this would be a low cost, easy access personal investment account designed to allow people regardless of their employment status to save for retirement in a flexible manner.</P>
    <P>The board's proposals in this regard are currently being examined and I would hope to bring forward proposals in this context of an occupational pensions Bill, which I propose to publish later this year.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would be happy to examine this.</P>

      <Quest>if he will include those on retirement pension for payment of the additional six weeks on the death of a spouse or partner in the same way as those receiving old age non-contributory pension, blind person's pension or carer's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Last February I introduced an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 in the Social Welfare Act, 1999. At that time, I indicated that these improvements were the first step in the development of new and improved after death arrangements.</P>
      <P>In the recent budget I introduced a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow or widower's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. It is estimated that this new payment will benefit over 1,500 widowed persons each year at a cost of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>The current practice is that following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment, his/her spouse continues to receive payment at the same rate for 6 weeks in circumstances where both spouses had a separate entitlement provided one or both of the entitlements was a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance or where the payment includes a payment for a qualified adult. The payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance based contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I now propose to introduce a number of additional measures, including the measure proposed by the Deputy, in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill to address the position where the six weeks after death payment is not currently made or is paid at a reduced amount. These measures are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> 1.Where a pensioner and his/her spouse/partner are each in receipt of an old age contributory or retirement pension and if either party dies, a six weeks payment of the deceased person's pension will be made to the survivor. Under the current arrangements no after death payment is made in these cases.</P>
    <P>2.Where a person who is in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension or blind person's pension dies and his/her spouse/partner is in receipt of an old age contributory or retirement pension, a six weeks payment of the deceased person's non-contributory pension will be paid to the survivor in addition to his/her own personal rate of contributory pension. At present, an amount equal to the qualified adult allowance only is payable.</P>
    <P>3.Where the only dependent child of a person in receipt of one-parent family payment dies, the parent will receive the same amount of the one-parent family payment for six weeks following the death of the child. At present the parent receives only the child dependent allowance.</P>
    <P>Approximately 3,300 people will benefit from these measures at a full year cost of approximately £1.5 million. These measures will be introduced from April 2000 and will mean that a six weeks after death payment now applies in all circumstances under the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 83,760 lone parent claims in payment at the end of December 1999. These include separated or unmarried persons in receipt of one-parent family payment which was introduced in 1997, and persons still receiving payment under the former lone parents allowance or deserted wife's benefit and allowance.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, applicants for one-parent family payment are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouse, or the parent of their child in the case of unmarried applicants. Normally, such maintenance is obtained by way of informal negotiation or by court order under family law, though separated couples are increasingly using the family mediation service for which my Department is now responsible and which is being progressively extended countrywide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say how many persons in receipt of one-parent family payment are also in receipt of maintenance from the other parent. In <Col N="592" /> cases where clients have income both from maintenance and employment, separate summary records are not available of the maintenance element of the means. In addition, in a significant number of cases maintenance may be in payment to the clients concerned which is disregarded for means assessment purposes. Such disregards apply particularly in the case of housing costs, where maintenance payments of up to £75 per week received by one-parent families can be disregarded where they are paying rent or mortgage in respect of their family homes. Statistics are not kept by my Department of the number of cases or of the amount of maintenance disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, a person has a legal responsibility to support his/her spouse and dependent children. Where social welfare support is being provided to the one-parent family, the other parent is legally liable to contribute to the cost of the payment. In implementing these provisions to date the Department has concentrated on those cases where the &ldquo;liable relatives&rdquo; concerned, being in employment or self-employment, appear to be in a financial position to make a contribution towards the relevant benefit or allowance being paid by the Department to their families.</P>
    <P>The process of securing maintenance from liable relatives has proved to be difficult and protracted. However, more than £3 million has been collected from some 537 liable relatives to date through this system.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to examine all potential cases with a view to securing maintenance, particularly in relation to those who are defaulting on their maintenance contribution obligations. Legislation allows the Department to seek recovery from liable relatives through the courts in appropriate cases, and a number of cases are now in the course of preparation for court action.</P>
    <P>I should add that as part of its ongoing process of expenditure reviews my Department is carrying out a review of the one-parent family payment including, <i>inter alia</i>, the treatment of maintenance and the operation of the liable relative system. It is expected that this review will be completed within the next three months.</P>

The schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the fuel allowance payment rate cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, domestic fuel prices have increased by less than 10% over the last 15 years.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 and the further increases of either £4 or £7 per week announced in the recent budget will come into effect from May this year.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <Quest>the supports, if any, available to widows or widowers over 60 years of age who do not qualify for an old age pension and whose spouse, prior to death, did not qualify for an old age pension; the plans, if any, he has to improve supports available to these people; the number of these people availing of a widow's or widower's pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of 1999 there were 80,595 people aged 60 and over in receipt of the widow or widower's contributory pension while a further 16,686 in the same age range were receiving the widow or widower's  non-contributory pension. There was also a small number receiving the one-parent family payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> The widow or widower's pension schemes, which are not age related, recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow or widower's contributory pension scheme are more flexible than those applying to the old age and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify by using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a person may also use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my budget speech, and following the review of the Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to extending a pension rate of £100 per week to all social welfare old age pensioners. In this regard, from May 2000, the weekly rate of the widow or widower's contributory pension will increase to £89.10 per week for those aged over 66. The maximum rate for a person aged under 66 years will be £81.10. A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test. From May 2000 the maximum rate of the widow or widower's non-contributory pension will be £85.50 per week for those over 66 and £77.50 for those aged under 66.</P>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows or widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. Following the recent budget, the free schemes will be extended to all persons aged over 75 years of age regardless of income and household composition.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers with children who do not qualify for a widow or widower's contributory pension can qualify for the one-parent family payment. The rate of the one-parent family payment will be £85.50 per week for those over 66 with effect from May 2000 for those aged under 66 the rate will be £77.50. It is available to both men and women who are parenting alone and is designed to, firstly, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, secondly, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence. To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>I announced a widowed parent's grant of £1,000 in the recent budget to provide additional support for those with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. The grant is expected to benefit about 1,500 widowed people each year. In the 1999 budget I <Col N="595" /> introduced the bereavement grant which increased the payment on the death of an insured person to £500. This payment benefited almost 17,000 people last year.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in an earlier reply to the Deputy I will be introducing a number of measures in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill to address the position where the six weeks after death payment is not currently made or is paid at a reduced rate.</P>
    <P>The improvements set out above are of specific benefit to widowed people. The position with regard to any further changes will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Asylum seekers who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 and who have completed 12 months in the asylum process but whose cases have not been decided, are eligible to seek employment. They are therefore eligible for unemployment assistance if they fulfil the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work and if their means are below the qualifying limit.</P>
      <P>The people involved, who have not found employment, have been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and are now in the process of being transferred, where appropriate, to unemployment assistance. They may qualify for back to work allowance provided that they satisfy the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the back to work allowance, applicants must be in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least 12 months. Recipients of one-parent family allowance, disability allowance, blind person's pension or carer's allowance can also qualify subject to the same condition.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement is a weekly employment support payment for families who are in employment and on low incomes. Once entitlement has been established and provided the person remains in full-time remunerative employment, payment continues for 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers can be paid family income supplement provided, as applies to all applicants, they satisfy all of the qualifying conditions for receipt of the supplement.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment made to people who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or people with disabilities whose income falls below certain limits. The principal condition for receipt of the allowance is that full time care and attention is required and being provided.</P>
      <P>On receipt of an application for carer's allowance, a comprehensive medical report form must be completed in respect of the person being cared for. This report is completed by the person's own doctor and is subsequently examined by one of my Department's medical assessors to determine if the medical criteria for the receipt of carer's allowance are satisfied.</P>
      <P>The medical assessors, who are all qualified and experienced medical practitioners, assess each case having regard to the report submitted by the applicant's general practitioner and other available medical evidence. For example, if the care recipient is already in receipt of a disability allowance or invalidity pension from the Department, the relevant medical evidence will be taken into account. The medical assessor evaluates each case on its merits and advises a deciding officer who then decides whether or not the necessary medical and other criteria are satisfied.</P>
      <P>In all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. In the case of carer's allowance these reviews are selective and are undertaken in a small number of appropriate cases, to ensure that the medical criteria continue to be fulfilled. During 1999 14 carer's allowance recipients had their claims disallowed on the basis that they did not satisfy the full time care attention condition, of which six were reinstated following appeal.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I am introducing from next October a new social insurance carer's benefit scheme which will provide a non-means tested payment to employed persons who give up employment to undertake caring duties. I have furthermore now secured Government agreement to an extension of the duration of payment of the benefit from 12 months, as announced in the budget, to 15 months.</P>
      <P>In the context of the introduction of that scheme my Department is reviewing the medical assessment procedures as they apply to carer's allowance. I think it is appropriate, however, that my Department's medical assessors would continue to have a role in the determination of entitlement under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to the supplement is determined by the health board in the light of the circumstances of each individual case and the cost of the accommodation. Payment is normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of the rent has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The payment arrangements are a matter for the health board and their customer, the tenant. There is no contractual relationship between the landlord and the health board. Payments are normally made directly to the tenant but a tenant can nominate another person to receive the payment. In some cases, tenants will nominate the landlord. At present, some 20% to 25% of rent supplement payments are paid directly to landlords and about one third of these are paid directly into landlords' bank accounts.</P>
      <P>With regard to improving accountability, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was computerised in a major project completed in June 1999. This provided integration with my Department's other short-term schemes. It has thus improved administration, reduced the potential for fraud or abuse and provides greater control of payments, for example through automated reviews. In addition, targeted control work is carried out periodically in each health board. This includes reviewing rent supplements to ensure that the recipient still resides at the address and that there are no changes in circumstances which would affect entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking to the future, the Deputy will know that the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new rent assistance scheme, operated by the local authorities, to serve people with long-term housing needs, including those who cur<Col N="598" /> rently rely on SWA rent supplements on a long-term basis. This will deliver an important element of the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, which commits the Government to the maximum co-ordination of housing policy under one Department.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make any further changes in relation to making payments directly to landlords at this time but this matter may be considered in the context of the new rent assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &ndash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions &ndash; which gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid. The unified system of social insurance was introduced in 1953 and the first major extension to the range of contingencies covered came in 1961 with the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>While contributions paid prior to 1961 contained no pension element, it was decided to count all such contributions paid under the unified scheme towards qualification for the new pension. Special transitional arrangements were also made for people who were close to reaching pension age at that time, which permitted certain contributions paid before 1953 to be taken into account for satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision was made for pre-1953 contributions, paid under the National Health Insurance Acts, to be taken into account for the purposes of satisfying two of the qualifying contribution conditions for the old age contributory pension, namely that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age and have, at least, 156 contributions paid. This arrangement still applies.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my budget speech, the Department has been examining ways in which further recognition can be given to pre-1953 contributions for those people who failed to qualify for a pension and I intend to bring forward proposals in this area in the context of this year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing the award of unemployment benefit provide that, amongst other things, a person must have sustained a substantial loss of employment in any period of six consecutive days to be eligible for payment. The regulations also provide that for a loss of employment to have been sustained, there must have been a reduction in earnings.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these regulations, a claimant of unemployment benefit is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if he or she has lost at least one day of insurable employment from that which is deemed to be his or her normal level of employment, coupled with a loss of earnings.</P>

      <P>The details requested by the Deputy, in so far as they are available, are set out in the following tables which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report. In some instances summary information only is available but arrangements will be made to have a county by county breakdown provided to the Deputy in those cases.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1999 there were a total of 7,117 persons in receipt of farm assist with a further 303 claims still under investigation. Apart from these 753 claims were still in payment under the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme. These will be reviewed and transferred to farm assist as appropriate when existing applications have been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I believe that the scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children. The smallholders who have transferred to farm assist receive a weekly payment averaging £83.06, an increase of £8.64 on what they previously received. New applicants receive on average a weekly payment of £56.88.</P>
      <P>The scheme clearly makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available across all the various schemes due to the variety of circumstances, complexity of situations and volumes of claims involved.</P>
      <P>In the main, decisions in regard to social welfare claims are given by deciding officers from whose decisions there is a right of appeal to an independent appeals officer. In the course of processing appeals new information can come to light which results in a revised decision by the deciding officer in favour of the claimant. During the first six months of 1999 there were 1,774 such revisions in the case of the illness and unemployment schemes.</P>
      <P>In regard to cases that fell to be determined by an appeals officer, some 1,265 appeals in the illness and unemployment categories were, during the period in question, allowed fully in favour of the appellants. A further 418 were allowed in part.</P>
      <P>In some instances the revised and appeals decisions related to new claims and so did not involve a cutting off and subsequent restoration of payment. However, many of the aforementioned cases resulted in restoration of payment where it had been completely discontinued. The remainder would have involved payment of a higher rate of benefit or allowance than allowed in the original deciding officer's decision where the question at issue was one of the level of assessment of means.</P>
      <P>In the general administration of schemes situations may arise where payment is temporarily interrupted as a result of a failure by the claimant to comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme. Payment is invariably restored at the earliest possible moment once the necessary checks or investigations are satisfactorily completed.</P>
      <P>In all cases where a person is not entitled to a social welfare payment he or she may apply for supplementary welfare allowance if his or her means are not sufficient to meet their needs or those of their dependants.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular situation or circumstance in mind where difficulties arose I would be happy to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>Individualisation of the social welfare system was considered in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting, and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> The group noted that individualisation already exists to a certain extent, firstly, in the social insurance system to the extent that those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>The group considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been achieved in this area over the last 12 years with coverage being extended to the self employed &ndash; 1988, part-time workers &ndash; 1991 and new civil-public servants in 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    <P>The working group also proposed, on foot of research on equivalent scales undertaken by the ESRI for the group, that the qualified adult allowance should be increased to 70% of the personal rate. The Government intends to reach this recommended level for the QAA over a period of three budgets and the process was started in the recent budget with increases of between 8% and 17% being provided.</P>
    <P>In principle, the QAA rate is set at less than 100% of the personal rate on the basis that there are economies of scale where two people live together in the same household, and that account should be taken of these economies where the second person does not have a direct entitlement to the payment in his/her own right.</P>
    <P>The group also considered that a general system of administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of the QAA direct to the person concerned should be introduced. The question of making such separate payments in all cases involves some complex social issues which need to be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of the qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment. In addition there would be some administrative and cost implications.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to individualisation overall in the social welfare code will be kept under review.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the proportion of funding allocated to social welfare claimants in the context of the stability pact budgetary figures submitted to Brussels when current Government expenditure is projected to fall below 25% of GDP by 2002.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1922/00]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The December 1999 update on Ireland's stability programme, which was published by the Minister for Finance at budget time, projects a decrease in the trend in general Government current expenditure as a percentage of GDP from 28.9% in 1999 to around 25.3% by 2002.</P>
      <P>However, the Updated Stability Programme highlights that projecting expenditure over the period 2000 to 2002 is complicated by the ongoing negotiations on a new national partnership agreement. I understand that potential public service pay increases on foot of any successor agreement have not, therefore, been included in the expenditure projections outlined in the Updated Stability Programme.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless in recent years the trend in general Government current expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been declining. This reflects the strong economic performance since the mid-1990s. While general Government current expenditure has been increasing during this period, because of the exceptionally strong economic performance, GDP has been increasing at an even faster pace. In addition, economic and demographic improvements during the period have meant that expenditure on certain Government programmes has been decreasing. For instance, the significant fall of 80,000 in the live register since this Government took office has led to substantial reductions in overall expenditure on unemployment payments, which has fallen by almost 30% from £1,011 million in 1996 to an estimated £712 million in 2000 despite the significant increases in the rates of payment over that period.</P>
      <P>In line with these developments, the trend in social welfare expenditure as a percentage of GDP has also been declining in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of economic growth generally are shared with the more vulnerable sections of our society so that all citizens have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. Accordingly, Government action is geared to ensuring that all relevant policy areas covering taxation, employment, social welfare, occupational pensions and others help those concerned to move out of poverty and live in a manner compatible with human dignity.</P>
      <P>Within this framework, the social welfare system has a central role to play. In this regard, the Government has substantially increased total annual social welfare expenditure since 1997 by almost £1 billion.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the recent social welfare budget package, costing about £423 million on a full year basis, represents the biggest ever social welfare allocation. To put this investment in context, it represents an increase of over £200 million or almost double the social welfare allocation in the 1997 budget which was introduced by my predecessor.</P>

      <P>The policy and executive functions of my Department were restructured into separate offices in 1986. One of these offices, known as social welfare services, is responsible for the day to day operations of the social welfare schemes and services.</P>
      <P>The establishment of social welfare services to administer the various schemes and to develop effective customer centred delivery mechanisms and management systems has enabled my Department to focus more effectively on the continuous improvement of its performance in this regard. This has led to significantly improved levels of service delivery over the period.</P>
      <P>A significant feature has been the implementation of my Department's customer action plan as part of the Delivering Better Government initiative.</P>
      <P>The putting in place of a regional management structure within social welfare services in 1991 has also enabled my Department to deal more effectively with issues of access and service delivery at a local level.</P>
      <P>The role and remit of my Department has broadened considerably since the establishment of social welfare services, for example, in the areas of social exclusion and in the development and improvement of services to the voluntary and community sector. The Department's role has also expanded in relation to services for families and this aspect of the Department's work will further expand and develop in the future.</P>
      <P>The greater integration of service delivery across Departments and agencies is also a Government priority and my Department has taken a leading role in this area, for example through the establishment of the REACH project to identify and foster opportunities for greater access to services using new technology within the framework of the information society action plan.</P>
      <P>All of these emerging developments have implications for the organisation of my Department and for the role of social welfare services in particular. The management structure of social welfare services has been changed as required to reflect the changing demands on it and the question of further changes, will be kept under review in the context of the implementation of the Government's ongoing strategic management initiative and the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was introduced in 1993 to provide income support during the summer holiday period for less well-off third level students who are unable to obtain summer work and are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides community based work for the students who meet the qualifying conditions and over the past six years it has provided financial support for students from low income families who would otherwise have been unable to find work, particularly in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The number of students participating in the scheme has fallen steadily since 1995 when close on 16,000 students worked. Some 9,200 students worked last year. This reduction in demand for the scheme reflects the wider availability of jobs especially in the services and tourism sectors. Obviously, it is better for students to obtain work in the open market and, as economic conditions continue to improve, I expect this trend to continue.</P>
      <P>The focus of the scheme must remain on students who are unable to get summer work and who have no other means of support. Experience has shown that a number of students obtained alternative work early in the summer and then opted for the scheme from mid to late August onwards until third level colleges reopened. The scheme was never intended for this purpose and, for this reason, the month of September was excluded from the 1999 scheme.</P>
      <P>Plans for the scheme this year are currently being prepared. At this stage I do not see any justification for extending the scheme in the manner proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reconsider the £70 to £135 earnings limits for the spouses of social welfare recipients taking up employment in the context of the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill; and his views on the submission from SIPTU that the earnings limits should be raised to £100 or £200 per week.</Quest>

      <P>Regulations currently provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants of certain welfare payments where the spouse or partner of the claimant is earning between £60 and £105 per week.</P>
      <P>A range of significant improvements to these tapering arrangements which will take effect from April of this year were announced in the recent budget. Most notably, these changes include an adjustment in the income range over which the tapering arrangements apply from the current £60 &ndash; £105 to £70 &ndash; £135; an improvement in the withdrawal rate of the QAA; the deferral of the reduction of 50% in the level of child dependant allowances, which currently takes effect when the income of the spouse exceeds £60, until such income exceeds £135; an increase in the spouse income disregard from the current level of £45 plus travel costs to £60 inclusive of travel costs; and the extension of tapering arrangements to long-term welfare payments such as invalidity pension, retirement pension and old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In drawing up these measures, careful account was taken of the views expressed by SIPTU. In addition, account needed to be taken of other factors, such as equity <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of people who combine work with receipt of a partial social welfare payment, and the need to ensure that the changes did not worsen the poverty trap by withdrawing the QAA over a range of income where the withdrawal rate would interact with the tax system. The measures we are introducing represent a reasonable balance between the various factors, and will have the effect of substantially alleviating the poverty traps associated with the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment made to people who are providing elderly or certain people with disabilities full time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits. The principal condition for receipt of the allowance is that full time care and attention is required and being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person participating on a community employment scheme would not be considered as requiring full time care and attention. In such cir<Col N="608" /> cumstances carer's allowance would not be payable.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to facilitate and support rehabilitation or respite from caring for care recipients and their carers. My Department has already reviewed the operation of the carer's allowance scheme and, in particular, the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care recipient with full time care and attention and this requirement has been progressively eased.</P>
    <P>Care recipients may now attend approved rehabilitation courses without affecting the allowance payable to the carer. Care recipients and carers may now also attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities. Furthermore in the Social Welfare Act 1999, I made provision that carers can undertake employment for up to ten hours per week while retaining their allowance.</P>
    <P>These changes have facilitated more people to qualify for carer's allowance. The numbers of persons receiving carer's allowance has increased to 14,600 compared with 11,416 at the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>Participation in community employment schemes is outside the scope of this provision. I will, however, review this position in the context of the future development of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The increase in the overall number of persons claiming the allowance allied to the measures I have introduced over successive budgets clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme provides an incentive to low-paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment by ensuring that such people are better off than they would be if they were instead relying on welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The recent NESC report recommends that the feasibility of paying FIS through the tax system be examined. NESC considered that if the payment were made through the tax system it would be more acceptable to potential beneficiaries. As with a range of other proposals contained in the NESC report, this issue will be explored initially in the context of the current discussions on the development of a successor agreement to Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any examination of the feasibility of this proposal would not just be a matter for my Department but would require detailed examination by <Col N="609" /> the Revenue Commissioners of the practical arrangements. The examination would have to take careful account of a number of key points.</P>
    <P>For instance, a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which is below the tax exemption limits appropriate to their family size. In order for such families to benefit from a tax credits system, the payment would have to take the form of a refundable tax credit. Refundable tax credits are not a feature of the current tax system here and the practicalities of introducing such payments would require further consideration.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to FIS is not determined solely on the basis of the claimant's earnings. Account is also taken, for instance, of family size, hours worked, the likely duration of employment, as well as any earnings which the spouse or partner of the claimant, where relevant, may have. Not all of this information is collected at present through tax returns made to the Revenue Commissioners, and the tax system is, therefore, not currently capable of automatically identifying the households with an entitlement to FIS. Any payment through the tax system would, therefore, still have to operate on the basis of the individual in the first instance supplying the additional information needed to establish entitlement to the payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was formed in 1997, this Government has demonstrated a commitment to the process of social inclusion and has introduced policies to help ensure that every individual has the opportunity to participate fully in society.</P>
      <P>While the National Anti-Poverty Strategy provided the framework for the implementation of cross-departmental policies to reduce poverty, economic and social developments since then have convinced this Government that the strategy needed to be broadened to reflect these changes.</P>
      <P>The global target adopted in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy is framed in terms of &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; as defined by the ESRI. A person is said to be consistently poor if they live in a household with less than 50% to 60% of average household income and experience enforced basic deprivation. Combining both these elements is considered by the ESRI to be a better measure of the extent of poverty at any given point in time than simply considering either part in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the results of the latest ESRI <Col N="610" /> research based on the 1997 Living in Ireland Survey, Monitoring Poverty Trends, are very encouraging. This publication demonstrates that the numbers experiencing consistent poverty fell from between 9% and 15% of the population in 1994 to between 7% and 10% by 1997 with the original NAPS target, which had a target date of 2007, virtually achieved. In light of this progress, earlier this year I announced ambitious new targets to reduce consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004.</P>
    <P>Also, I announced that the NAPS interdepartmental policy committee should examine the possibilities of setting new targets in new areas of policy and that the views of the social partners would be sought in this regard.</P>
    <P>Securing employment is the surest route out of poverty and this Government has presided over unprecedented reductions in unemployment and significant increases in employment levels. The level of unemployment has been reduced to 5.7%, from 11.9% in 1996, and long-term unemployment has now been reduced to 2.1%. A combination of strong economic performance, labour market interventions, income supports and tax reform have ensured that the downward trend has been constant.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have provided increases in social welfare payments which have ensured that all payments now exceed the minimum recommended rate of the Commission on Social Welfare. The future direction of social welfare rates generally is a matter which is under continuing consideration within my Department and in the current partnership negotiations. I expect that the issues of poverty and social inclusion will form an important element of any new partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>The elimination of poverty in any society can only occur when we have eliminated its causes. This Government has worked throughout its term to tackle the root causes of poverty across various themes including income adequacy, educational disadvantage, unemployment, rural poverty, and urban disadvantage, and, while we are already seeing reductions in consistent poverty, its eventual elimination is something that we, as a society, need to strive for. The groundwork for this is now taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 35, 131 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>The various social welfare measures announced in the recent budget amount to more than £418 million on a full year basis &ndash; the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation. To put this investment in context, the equivalent figures for my previous two budgets were £316 million in 1999 and £225 million in 1998. The 1997 budget, which was introduced by my predecessor, amounted to some £215 million.</P>
      <P>The budget provides for an increase of £7 a week for old age pensioners, together with an increase of £4 a week for all other social welfare recipients aged under 66 years. In addition, as part of the process of aligning the implementation of tax and social welfare increases by 2001, the improved payments will take effect four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>The budget also provides for a range of other major improvements in the social welfare system, including additional increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances to bring these rates up to 70% of the appropriate personal rate over three years; increases in monthly child benefit of £8 per child for the first and second child and £10 per child for subsequent children; £20 increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance; major improvements in the method of assessing capital for means test purposes; introduction of a new PRSI-based carer's benefit scheme; introduction of a new £1,000 widowed parent's grant; extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income or household situation; substantial changes in the arrangements for the retention of rent and mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist long-term unemployed people with families who are seeking to return to work with employment incentive schemes; and improvements in the retention of the qualified adult and child allowances when the qualified adult takes up work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Government has approved a range of further improvements which I will introduce in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill. These measures include an extension of new capital assessment arrangements announced in the budget to cover recipients of unemployment assistance, with effect from October, 2000; &ndash;  an extension of the maximum duration for the new carer's benefit scheme, from one year to 15 months; a further increase of £1.90 a week in the <Col N="612" /> personal rate of invalidity pension for those aged under 65 years so as to align it with the personal rate of widow/er's contributory pension for those aged under 66 years, bringing the new rate to £81.10 from May, 2000; improvements in the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension for those with pre-1953 contributions who do not otherwise qualify for pension and the introduction of a standardised rate of pension for those with yearly averages of between 20 and 47 contributions; and the removal of a number of anomalies in the current operation of the after death payments provisions.</P>
    <P>All of these measures continue with the focus of my two previous budgets by securing the future for our older people, improving the living standards of everybody on social welfare, providing particular support for people with disabilities and carers and supporting families and communities.</P>
    <P>They also clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to continue to address the needs of sections of the community that have been to a greater or lesser extent by-passed by the current economic boom so as to ensure the quality of life is improved for everyone.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board's report Securing Retirement Income, arising out of the National Pensions Policy Initiative, was published in May 1998. At the time of publication of the report, I set out the Government's response in &ldquo;Action on Pensions,&rdquo; a copy of which was furnished to each Deputy at the time. This response generally welcomed the broad thrust of the proposals and commented on the key recommendations.</P>
      <P>Overall, the recommendations in the board's report involve the development of strong first pillar social welfare pensions, based on social insurance, and major improvements in our second pillar, occupational and personal pensions, with the ultimate objective of ensuring that 70% of those at work over the age of 30 have second pillar cover as compared to just under 50% at present. The board <i>inter alia</i> recommended the introduction of a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) framework to achieve this increase in coverage.</P>
      <P>The PRSA is envisaged by the board as a low-cost, easy access personal investment account designed to allow people, regardless of their employment status, to save for retirement in a flexible manner. A working group, chaired by my Department and comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Pensions Board, has made good progress to date in examining the many detailed issues relating to the PRSA framework. The working group held a series of consultative meetings with potential PRSA providers which served to further inform the group on the technical and operational issues relating to the development of a framework. In this regard, the group is now finalising a document setting out the proposed framework for PRSAs and the issues surrounding these for my consideration. I would hope to bring forward proposals in this regard in the context of an occupational Pensions Bill, which I plan to publish later this year.</P>

      <P>The qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions apply to all insured people &ndash; both employees and self-employed. These qualifying conditions require a person to have entered social insurance before age 56, for the old age contributory pension, and age 55, for the retirement pension; and a minimum of 156 contributions paid. This requirement for all contributors will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively; and a yearly average of, at least, ten contributions paid or credited from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. The reduction in the yearly average requirement from 20 to ten was introduced in November 1997, leading to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension. Where a person has a yearly average of between ten to 14 contributions, he/she is entitled to a pension rate at 50% of the standard maximum rate while those with averages of between 15 to 19 receive a pension rate equivalent to 75% of the standard maximum rate. Where the yearly average is between ten and 19, a minimum of 260 contributions must have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is, therefore, already made in the social welfare system for <i>pro rata</i> pensions. In addition, any person who fails to qualify for, say, an old age contributory or retirement pension under the standard qualifying conditions and who <Col N="615" /> has worked abroad, may qualify for an EU or bilateral <i>pro rata</i> pension, based on a combination of his/her Irish and foreign social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pro rata</i> pensions were also introduced, in 1991, for people with &lsquo;mixed insurance' records &ndash; that is, where a combination of both full and mixed rate social insurance contributions have been paid. The rate of pension payable is in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age contributory/retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>Last April I introduced new pension arrangements in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. These relate to a very specific group of people, namely, self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed and who could not qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>A special old age contributory pension is, therefore, now available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years' contributions paid since then. The rationale behind this five-year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of their careers. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependents, where applicable. I consider these new arrangements to be fair reflecting, as they do, a certain consistency of commitment to the Social Insurance Fund over a given period of time. Of course, where a self-employed person does not qualify for this pension the facility still exists for him or her to apply for a refund of the pension element of the social insurance contribution, provided that he or she does not qualify for the means-tested old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The question of paying a <i>pro rata </i>contributory pension in all cases regardless of the level of contributions has to be addressed in the wider context of the fundamental principles of the social insurance system, namely, in terms of equity and redistribution. Any person who has made a reasonable level of contributions over their working career is entitled to expect and receive a contributory-based pension. The National Pensions Board in 1993 considered that a &lsquo;reasonable attachment' to social insurance constituted a minimum of ten years. The special arrangement, described above, which I introduced for certain self-employed people, was a sympathetic response to the predicament of some people who, through no fault of their own, could not qualify for a pension in accordance with the standard qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> In terms of the overall situation, the Department has been reviewing the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review has been undertaken with a view to ensuring that social welfare contributory pensions continue to meet the needs of current and future generations of contributors. The Department is, at present, finalising a report on the first phase of this review process and I expect to receive this shortly. I have already indicated to the House on a number of occasions that when the report has been considered by the Government, I will report to the House at that stage.</P>

      <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out an independent appraisal of the concept of and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment to all citizens. The agreement provides that this research will be overseen by a broadly based steering group. This steering group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The steering group has commissioned the necessary research in two phases. The first phase, which is now almost completed, has examined the tax rate needed to fund basic income, and the distributional implications of introducing basic income with this tax rate.</P>
      <P>I understand that the report from the second phase is expected within the next few months. This will cover the dynamic effects of the proposal, including its effects on employment, effects on economic growth, short-term and long-term budgetary implications and the gender dimensions of all these.</P>
      <P>Any future developments in this area, including the proposed Green Paper on Basic Income, will need to await the outcome of the research programme I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>The network of social welfare local offices currently provides trained information officers at 57 locations throughout the country. Arrangements are in hand to extend information facilities at a further 70 social welfare branch offices to include all schemes as soon as <Col N="617" /> preparatory work is complete. In addition social welfare inspectors in over 50 locations provide a call-in service for inquiries on at least one day per week. In addition to these facilities provided directly by my Department, Comhairle, formerly the National Social Services Board, funded by my Department also provides an extensive network of citizen information centres providing a full range of information on citizens' entitlements in the social services area.</P>
      <P>My Department is developing more easily accessible client centred services in the context of the Strategic Management and Delivering Better Government initiatives. The new service delivery model outlined in my Department's Strategy Statement 1998-2001 will further improve service delivery. For example, it will: make it easier for people to conduct business by telephone; reduce the amount of information people must give when making a claim; and streamline procedures where people move from one scheme to another.</P>
      <P>I have also initiated moves to improve customers' access to public services across agencies. The REACH initiative, which I announced last September, will facilitate the development of integrated services across the public sector by promoting greater sharing of information among public bodies, the deployment of a common public service card and the use of the latest technologies to provide access to services for the citizen.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent or the interest portion of the mortgage, has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means which they have in excess of the appropriate SWA rate. In effect, this means that all of the difference between the relevant SWA rate and the means which a person has goes towards their rent or mortgage, thereby reducing the amount of rent or mortgage interest supplement rate payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 6 April next a disregard of £25 per week will apply in the case of rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients who take up either part<Col N="618" /> time work or participate in an approved training course. The weekly earnings disregard of £25 which is being introduced for part-time workers will apply to the net gain from employment after any adjustments have been made in their primary weekly payment, such as unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The objective of these changes is to give an incentive to people to take up either part-time employment or an approved training course by disregarding the first £25 per week in additional income from these sources when assessing the amount of SWA rent or mortgage interest supplement payable.</P>
    <P>These measures will increase the attractiveness of part-time work and of training courses which will help people to gain the skills necessary to secure future employment. It also means that these groups of people will see a real increase in their income of £25 per week.</P>

      <P>The social welfare system, in general, is contingency based and also assumes that there are economies of scale where two people are married or cohabiting. In the cir<Col N="620" /> cumstances, under the present system, in means tested arrangements a reduction in income is inevitable where a person changes status from being a lone parent or single to one where he/she marries or cohabits. Clearly a payment based on the contingency of lone parenthood cannot continue where the individual decides to marry or cohabit.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which was published in August last year, set out the losses which can be experienced by a couple who decide to marry or cohabit where one or both are receiving social welfare payments. Where both are receiving social welfare payments the losses can, to some extent, be eased by the payment of a qualified adult allowance. The position here will be improved by my commitment to increase the level of the QAA to 70% of the personal rate in line with the findings of the research undertaken by the ESRI on behalf of the working group. However, where one or both are working, as can be the case in a lone parent situation because of the more generous means test arrangements, the losses can be significant.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely complex and sensitive issue and in considering what, if anything, should be done it is necessary to bear in mind not only the position of people who might be considering marriage or cohabitation but also the need to avoid introducing further anomalies into the system. The working group did not come to any conclusions in this area. However, it did put forward some proposals which are being considered as part of a review of the one-parent family payment. This review is being undertaken by my Department under the expenditure review programme and it is expected that it will be completed in the next few months.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend child benefit rates for twins to the same level as for other multiple births in the context of the Social Welfare Bill and possible future budgetary changes.</Quest>

      <P>I have set out the position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births on a number occasions to this House in the recent past. Briefly, the position is that, prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act 1998 in fulfilment of our <Col N="621" /> pre-election commitments. The rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. The £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>In the interim, I have also provided for very substantial additional investments in the child benefit scheme. The 1999 budget provided for an additional full-year investment in the scheme of over £40 million, while the recent budget provides for a further £106 million and brings the total full year investment in child benefit to about £575 million. From September of this year, the basic child benefit rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including families with twins and represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources.</P>

      <P>The number of cases refused participation in this strand of the scheme since that date is 79. The reasons for refusal in these cases were as follows: six were not in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course; 20 were not in receipt of a relevant payment for at least six months, 156 days, prior to commencing an approved course; nine did not satisfy the age condition prior to commencing an approved course; 13 were not commencing the first year of their course; 15 were attending courses not recognised for the purposes of the scheme; and 16 failed to satisfy two or more of the qualifying conditions.</P>

      <P>The recent social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to more than £418 million on a full year basis, provides,<i> inter alia</i>, for a £7 a week increase for pensioners and a £4 a week increase for all other social welfare recipients. As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>The £7 weekly increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. With average annual inflation expected to be 3% in 2000, these increases represent real increases ranging between 2.1% and 5.7%.</P>
      <P>Last year's social welfare increases fulfilled the Partnership 2000 commitment to implement the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare before the end of the partnership. Following the recent budget increases, all payments will be at least £2.40 above the minimum CSW target rate, ranging between 103% and 130%.</P>
      <P>The issue of the future direction of social welfare rates was examined by NESC in its strategy document: &ldquo;Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice&rdquo;, which forms an important input into the new partnership discussions. The NESC strategy document noted that key considerations include benchmarking options such as 50% of average income threshold, a percentage of gross average industrial earnings, the up-rated maximum Commission on Social Welfare rate and indexing options such as linkage to some rate above inflation, increases in average incomes or increases in GAIE.</P>
      <P>The future direction of social welfare payments has been raised by the social partners as part of the negotiations on a new national partnership agreement. Any decision in relation to this obviously has to await the conclusion of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>It is not FÁS practice to provide participants for community employment projects in schools or elsewhere based on a child care course being provided. FÁS requires sponsors to provide on-the-job training for all project participants and funding is made available for such training. This training may relate to the job which the CE participant is filling or to assist them to pursue a career opportunity.</P>
      <P>Schools have not been excluded from the CE programme. An audit of projects was undertaken in November 1999 to find out the number of CE workers employed in schools as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants. The result of this audit shows that there were 5,804 persons participating in CE projects in schools at that time. My Department and the Department of Education and Science have entered into discussions on this issue.</P>
      <P>Within the context of the overall number of places on CE, FÁS has operational responsibility for project selection and appraisal. It is FÁS policy that projects providing quality work experience for participants and worthwhile services to community groups will get priority, particularly where they lead to good progression to further education-training or employment. The type of experience gained by participants in schools projects does not, in general, lead to good progression opportunities.</P>

A range of variables covering payments to international organisations, tax deductibility, refugee costs, the aid element of the EU budget, administrative costs etc will be checked by March at which time more accurate estimates should be available. Given the number of variables involved in estimating ODA, any estimate for 2001 would be unreliable at this stage.</P>
    <P>We accept and are committed to reaching the UN target for all donors of 0.7% of GNP. We have in addition set an interim target of 0.45% of GNP to be reached in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>However, our efforts to make progress to these targets have been complicated by the high growth in GNP since 1996 and also by the recent switch across the EU to a new system of calculating GNP in member states which increases the base GNP figure. Both these developments have adversely affected the trajectory to the UN and interim targets.</P>
    <P>Despite this, the Government is pledged to increasing ODA by significant cash amounts year on year and to making credible progress to the targets. The three year agreement between the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on allo<Col N="627" /> cations over 1999, 2000 and 2001 is evidence of the Government's determination on the matter. Negotiations on extending these multi-annual allocations arrangement will commence shortly.</P>

      <P>The persons referred to in the Deputy's question are all Chinese citizens who were resident in Ireland for purposes of work or study. All are active members of the body known as Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities last July. Four such individuals returned to China from Ireland before Christmas and, according to the information received from one of them, engaged in various Falun Gong related activities, including lodging or attempting to lodge complaints with the Chinese authorities on the latter's policy in regard to the Falun Gong movement. As a result of these activities, they were arrested by the Chinese authorities. Three of these persons have not been allowed by the Chinese authorities to leave China and I understand they may be under various forms of detention, including house arrest, in their respective home locations. The fourth individual was allowed to leave China and returned to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that Ireland, together with its EU partners, has closely monitored the measures taken by the Chinese Government, against Falun Gong practitioners. We have expressed our concern about the situation and called on the Chinese authorities to respect the human rights of individuals, including those who are followers of the Falun Gong. We have urged the Chinese authorities not to act against the principles contained in the UN covenants signed by China, in particular those relating to the freedoms of expression, assembly and association. We have also expressed concern about the number of arrests and the heavy sentences imposed on members of the Falun Gong movement. These concerns also extend to heavy sentences imposed on members of the China Democratic Party and on members of Christian churches. The last such occasion when such concerns were expressly raised by Ireland was last week.</P>
      <P>As none of these persons is an Irish citizen, Ireland has no consular function in this matter. As they are Chinese citizens they are subject to the laws of China while in that country, including in respect of Falun Gong.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which the new investment in carriages for the DART service will increase the number of carriages per kilometre mile of track in view of the fact that these extra carriages will have to service the additional extensions to Malahide and Greystones; the current passenger volumes and carriages; the projected passenger and carriage volumes when the extensions are fully operational; and if she will give assurances that the feature of crushing which has given rise to the safety fears will be overcome by this investment.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2115/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing DART fleet comprises 80 vehicles. Under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 65% EU funding was secured for the acquisition of an additional ten DART carriages. Two of these have recently been delivered while the remaining eight will be delivered in tranches of two by the end of February. As a result of the reallocation of Luas funding in 1998 an additional order for 16 DART carriages is being co-funded by the EU and the Exchequer. These carriages will be delivered in the autumn. The total fleet will then be 106.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the national development plan 2000-06 has made provision for the purchase of a further 46 DART cars.</P>
      <P>The present DART extends from Howth to Bray, a distance of 38 km. The extensions to Greystones and Malahide will add seven kilometres at either end bringing the overall length to 52 km. The ratio of carriages per kilometre will decrease slightly from 2.11 to 2.04. However, this may not be the most appropriate yardstick for comparison purposes for a variety of reasons: while the length of the DART will be extended by 14km or 37%, only three additional stations will be added to the existing 26 stations;the catchment areas for the new DART stations will include existing suburban rail passengers from Malahide and passengers who at present drive to Bray; it does not adequately reflect the real increase in DART capacity of 32.5%. This will be further significantly increased over the period of the national development plan through the acquisition of the additional 46 DART cars and infrastructural works, including the extension of station platforms to accommodate eight car DART and increased city centre capacity. When that investment has been completed, peak DART capacity will be almost twice what it was at the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The current passenger carryings are approximately 20 million per annum. In recent years the rate of growth has been of the order of 5%-6% per annum and this rate of growth is projected to continue for the foreseeable future. The Malahide and Greystones extensions will clearly give rise to some additional patronage. However, it is not possible to predict this exactly because of a likely diversion of existing passengers who currently drive to Bray to board the DART or take diesel trains from Malahide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the safety aspect, which the Deputy has raised, I must point out that I have <Col N="629" /> no statutory function in relation to overcrowding of public transport vehicles. Responsibility for ensuring safety on these vehicles rests with CIE and its subsidiaries. It is therefore a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
    <P>I have advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing their attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that an independent appraisal of the carrying capacity of all of its rolling stock is to be undertaken to ensure that the carriages are fit for purpose.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the discomfort that passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times. However, very heavy loadings of this kind are not uncommon on urban rail systems throughout the world. There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes. I am satisfied that the ongoing investment in the DART will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods and should therefore help to alleviate the difficulties with regard to overcrowding.</P>

      <P>There is no specific statutory prohibition on the State investing in bodies in its ownership, including Aer Rianta. However, such investment must be in conformity with our obligations under the EU Treaties. In particular, Articles 81 to 89 of the Amsterdam Treaty deal with competition matters, State aid matters and issues related to public undertakings and undertakings to which a member state has granted special or exclusive rights. In considering such cases, the European Commission applies &ldquo;the commercial investor principle&rdquo; and their specific approval is required in advance. However, in the case of Aer Rianta's capital investment programme, funds are provided from Aer Rianta's own resources and the need for direct investment by the State does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce statutory safety standards in relation to groundhandling operations at Irish airports. I understand that the advice of the Health and Safety Authority is that, unless a case is established for such, the industry should agree on current best practice standards and apply those. The authority carries out a regular inspection of airport activities to which the health and safety laws apply, including compliance with duties imposed on either those who control workplaces or who employ workers.</P>
      <P>Groundhandling companies which are approved, under the regulations to implement the groundhandling directive, to operate at Irish airports receive their approval on the basis that they will comply with the requirements of both the airport manager at that airport, and the airlines with whom they contract, as regards each organisation's technical and safety standards for groundhandling operations.</P>
      <P>In addition, they are also subject to the health and safety legislation in the normal manner and to the bye-laws in force at airports as regards safe working practices.</P>
      <P>When airlines use sub-contractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility in the first instance to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service provider. The Irish Aviation Authority &ndash; IAA &ndash; as the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation, monitors the activities of airlines in this regard. Aircraft operators are responsible to the IAA for ensuring that the ground services they have contracted for are properly and safely rendered.</P>

      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ballincollig the independent consultants appointed to draw up an integrated action area plan for the former barracks, undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as an integral part of their commission. The integrated plan for the future development of the property is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC which was adopted on 29 May 1999. A tender competition was held in October 1999 for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the property. It is proposed to appoint selling agents in the near future following which the sale of the barracks will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area <Col N="632" /> action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. A number of the proposals received have been shortlisted and those consultants placed on the shortlist have been invited to make presentations before a selection committee, prior to final selection. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker agreement has been completed by the North-Eastern Health Board under which they will be allowed to occupy the property immediately.</P>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks.</P>

In that regard, it was decided to issue a general circular with the December 1999 pension cheques giving details of the special payments to such veterans and spouses, 2,000 in number.</P>
      <P>Since the issue of the December pension cheques on 15 December 1999, telephone calls have been received in the pensions section of my Department from a small number &ndash; fewer than ten &ndash; of Defence Forces pensioners, of whom there are some 9,000 in total, who had mistakenly received the circular intended for the War of Independence-related pensioners. The position was explained and apologies were made to these pensioners for the error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been investigated in my Department and I am satisfied that, due to human error, a very small number of Defence Forces pensioners were mistakenly issued with the circular regarding special millennium payments.

      <P>As indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 252 and 257 on 26 January 2000, heavy rains in December and January resulted in extensive flooding in the Shannon catchment area as well as in some western counties. The threat of flooding has been a feature of farming especially in the Shannon basin for many years and despite several studies and remedial plans in the past the danger of serious flooding occurring in the future remains. While some farmers have incurred fodder losses as a result of the recent flooding, the general level of fodder stocks entering the winter were satisfactory. Accordingly, I have no plans for a special fodder compensation scheme. The underlying recurring problem of the Shannon flooding needs to be addressed by the formulation of comprehensive measures involving all the official agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>Total direct income payments to farmers in each of the last five years were as follows: 1995 &ndash; £747.5 million, 1996 &ndash; £911.4 million, 1997 &ndash; £940.4 million, 1998 &ndash; £1,038.0 million and 1999 &ndash; £912.0 million &ndash; provisional figure. These payments were in respect of a large number of schemes. Livestock premia and arable aid, which together accounted for 65% of these payments in 1998, are fully funded by the EU. Other schemes are co-financed by the EU and the Exchequer, or are wholly nationally funded.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed a total of 15.33 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 14.70 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.63 hectares or 4.29% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case a penalty of 1.26 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 13.44 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The delay in the issue of the tag in this case was attributable to the fact that the herd had inadvertently been made dormant on the computer system and accordingly, the tag could not be released by Eurotags until the status of the herd was re-established by the district veterinary office.</P>

      <P>Public sector superannuation terms provide for a package of benefits, including pension and lump sum on retirement, death gratuity on death in service and spouses and children's pensions where the member predeceases the spouse or child.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the fact that employee contributions under the spouse's and children's scheme are not refunded where, for example, the member is single at retirement or death in service.  A single employee would, if retiring, qualify for pension and lump sum or, if the employee dies in service, a death gratuity would be payable to the estate. As regards the non-refund of contributions in these circumstances, the spouse's and children's scheme was established on an actuarial basis, with members' contributions being intended to meet one half of the cost. The actuarial costing took account of the fact that contributions are not refunded to single people.  The scheme operates on the insurance principle, with all members contributing in order to provide pensions in respect of those members who on death leave eligible spouses and-or children.</P>

      <P>In 1993, following the Supreme Court judgment in the Best case, my Department wrote to the manufacturer and to the health boards requesting <Col N="642" /> information on usage of Trivax batch no. 3741, but it was not possible to establish the extent of the distribution of the batch. At that time the numbers of the lots which had been produced from batch 3741 were not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>After further consideration of the matter, in 1997 my Department asked the company for any information it could provide on the lot numbers of vaccine produced from batch 3741, on the basis that it was probably these numbers which would have been noted in individual immunisation records. The company's responses, received in 1997 and 1998, gave details of the lot numbers and quantities of vaccine produced from batch 3741. The vaccine was manufactured in 1968 and the shelf life for both vials and ampoules was two years from the last manufacturing step. The company indicated that it did not have distribution records available in respect of these vaccine lots.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of this additional information my Department asked the health boards to re-examine their records to see if the extent of usage of these lots in the 1968-1970 period could be established. Final responses have now been received from all of the health boards. The Southern Health Board has indicated that 107 children received vaccine from two of the lots concerned. My Department has no information to indicate that adverse reactions were reported in recipients of vaccine from the lots concerned.</P>
      <P>In February 1999 my Department wrote to the company in question to seek details of certain other batches of Trivax vaccine produced in the late 1960s. The company responded that the results of all tests, mandatory and otherwise, together with expert advice which the company had sought, indicate that no other batch gave rise to the same level of potential concern as batch 3741. The company also indicated that it had made every effort to provide as much information as possible to my Department in response to queries regarding the Trivax vaccine.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering this whole matter with a view to determining what, if any, further action is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at outpatient level. In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of its efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas.</P>
      <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to September 1999 was 631,998. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of over 4% on the same period in 1998. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 12% in the first nine months of 1999 over 1998 levels. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the overall range of medical and surgical services available at Waterford Regional Hospital has been greatly expanded over recent years. New regional specialities of dermatology, nephrology, rheumatology, vascular surgery and oncology have been <Col N="644" /> established there and a trauma orthopaedic service has also been developed on site. These developments have been made possible by an increase of approximately £9.5 million in revenue funding for the hospital in the last three years and by the completion of major phased capital works on the site at a total cost of some £65 million. My Department is continuing to work with the South Eastern Health Board management in identifying and addressing priorities for the ongoing development of services at the hospital in the context of available funding.</P>

I have allocated the board additional funding of approximately £600,000 in 2000 to provide additional services for older people including day care and respite care and home support services. This funding will also be used to strengthen multidisciplinary teams through the appointment of additional posts of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.</P>

      <P>The Government announced in the 1996 budget that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;  Persons who are on the live register for at least one year and who take up paid insurable employment are deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including the back to work allowance, community employment, jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as the workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the 1996 budget provision took effect a number of problems relating to its interpretation and application in particular circumstances have come to light. The most frequent problems have arisen in relation to the time of commencement of the three year retention period for those moving from subsidised employment into &ldquo;open&rdquo; employment and in relation to persons taking up part-time employment while still signing on the live register for a few days a week. To address the issue a joint Department of Health and Children-<Col N="647" /> health board working group was established with the following terms of reference: to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards particularly as they relate to the budget 1996 provision in relation to persons who have been on the live register for 12 months and who take up paid insurable employment and also to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards agreed with the recommendations made in the report and requested that revised guidelines be prepared. The guidelines have been agreed and are in the process of being printed and circulated within each health board area. The purpose of the guidelines, which will be available to the public, is to facilitate greater awareness of the provision, and speedier, more consistent and transparent processing of applications.</P>

The position in relation to alternative-complementary medicine in Ireland is that it is not regulated by statute as practitioners of alternative-complementary medicine are not employed within the public health service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the control of standards and codes of practice in this area, the Department's policy has been to encourage the various therapeutic groups to establish their own regulatory structure and to develop mechanisms to inform the public about the availability of services from reputable therapists. Many of the therapeutic groups have adopted this system of self-regulation.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that it is desirable to afford some protection to the public who wish to use such therapies. the legal position of practitioners of complementary-alternative medicines is that their dealings with their clients are regulated by civil law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Board has been responsible for the making of adoption orders since the introduction of adoption in Ireland on 1 January 1953. It is an independent statutory body established under the Adoption Act, 1952, and is responsible for the administration of the adoption process. As the primary body responsible for adoption matters it has developed a specialised knowledge of the issues surrounding adoption, domestic and inter-country. I sought a report from the board in relation to its recent circular regarding age limits for couples applying for an assessment of suitability for inter-country adoption. It has advised as follows in relation to the matter.</P>
      <P>The board outlined in broad terms the reasoning behind the recent decision to issue guidelines on age limits. It referred to the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures. I have already commented in detail in the House on the reasons this report was commissioned. The report recommends that there be no more than a 42 year age gap between the adopters and the child. Under existing legislation the board is unable to impose such an age restriction when making declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt abroad. This difficulty arises from the fact that couples, once granted their declaration, make their own arrangements regarding the placement or adoption of a foreign child in the country of origin. There were, therefore, practical difficulties in implementing the recommendation precisely as outlined in the report.</P>
      <P>The board referred to the fact that an increasing number of adult adoptees who were adopted in the State have complained to the board that they were placed with older couples. These adoptees have stated that their childhood experiences of being reared by their adoptive parents were more akin to being reared by grandparents because their adoptive parents were older than the parents of their peers.</P>
      <P>The board advised that it also had regard to the approximate upper age limit at which children are born in to the normal Irish family and the desirability of the adopted child having the life expectation that its parents would be in the age bracket to enable them to nurture the child to adulthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board also expressed its concern at the increasing age profile of inter-country adopters <Col N="649" /> and referred to similar concerns expressed by social workers in the assessing agencies.</P>
    <P>The board noted that in reaching its decision to impose an age limit it is obliged to consider the welfare of the child as of paramount importance and in this context it has allowed exceptions to the age limit in cases where the prospective adoptive parents have a pre-existing relationship with the child or where the sibling becomes available for adoption. The board commented that, to date, approximately 90% of couples who applied to have their inter-country adoptions recognised under Irish law or who have had Irish adoption orders made in respect of foreign children, have come within the board's latest guidelines on age.</P>
    <P>Specifying age limits for eligibility is one of the more controversial aspects of the inter-country adoption process. I am satisfied, however, that the board's report as outlined above reflects the careful attention given to this decision to issue guidelines. It also helps to remind us that adoption is a service for children in which we must consider the interests of the child as paramount.</P>

    <P>This year my Department has provided £2 million additional funding for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. Of this amount, £400,000 will be used to fund campaigns to educate young people on a range of family planning-sexual health issues. Health boards have been asked to concentrate service developments on measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15 to 34 age group. Several boards are considering initiatives aimed particularly at teenagers with a view to reducing the number of births to teenage mothers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme, DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. Even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the publication of the spending Estimates for 2000, I announced the allocation of £3 million revenue funding and £3 million capital funding for the commencement of a programme for the development of renal dialysis services. This programme, which I hope to see completed over three years at an estimated total cost of £20 million, will be aimed at achieving a structured enhancement of the capacity of the system to meet existing and anticipated growth in demand for renal services in coming years. It will ensure the equitable availability of treatment choices for dialysis patients. This year's investment is primarily directed at addressing immediate requirements that are apparent from my Department's review of services in the area. In this context, a sum of £350,000 has been allocated to the South Eastern Health Board to enable the board to meet demand for haemodialysis places from patients in the region who have previously been unable to access a service locally.</P>

I very much welcome publication of this report which provides valuable information for women in relation to available services at maternity hospitals and units. The document will be of considerable benefit in informing women in relation to maternity services.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the World Health Organisation's recommended rates for caesarean sections. I am concerned by the wide variations between hospitals in Ireland, as reported by Cuidiú, in the rate of procedures such as caesarean sections. While some element of such variation can usually be explained by reference to the complexity of cases being dealt with it is important that the reasons for remaining variations be understood and explained. Accordingly, I have asked my Department's chief medical officer to seek the views of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as the organisation with professional responsibility for standards in this area. As with all medical interventions, caesarean sections should only be undertaken for sound clinical reasons in the interest of both mothers and babies.</P>

      <P>Statutory provisions governing roadside trees and vegetation are contained in section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993. These provisions oblige landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that trees, shrubs, hedges or any other vegetation on their land are not, or could not become, a danger to road users.</P>
      <P>Where a local authority considers that a hazard exists, it may serve notices on landowners and occupiers of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority itself can carry out the works specified in the notice in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply with it. The authority may also carry out additional works which it considers necessary. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local authority can act at once without serving a notice to remove or reduce the danger. In either case, the local authority may recover the cost of the works from the landowner or occupier.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these powers are properly designed to enable local authorities to take necessary action in relation to roadside obstructions. At the same time, local authorities have been advised that, in the exercise of these powers, they should also be aware of their responsibilities in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities. Other relevant statutory provisions include the Wildlife Act, 1976, for which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grants scheme is targeted at meeting the needs of elderly people living in unfit housing who would otherwise require to be rehoused by the local authority. The scheme enables basic repairs to be carried out to houses which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The cost of rewiring a house is not specifically excluded under the scheme but it is a matter for local authorities to assess the circumstances of each individual case and decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants.</P>
      <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly, which is operated by health boards, administers an emergency aid programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation.

It would be a matter for health boards to assess whether rewiring works would qualify for funding under the scheme taking account of the circumstances of the individual case.</P>

      <P>Full access to bus lanes is at present per<Col N="657" /> mitted only to buses and large public service vehicles. Pedal cycles and taxis may use &lsquo;with flow' bus lanes. Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, have not been permitted to use bus lanes in view of their more limited service role, which does not involve publicly standing or plying for hire. The Dublin Taxi Forum, while recommending some form of external identification for hackneys to facilitate enforcement of regulations by the Garda Síochána, nonetheless recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys, against roof signage for hackneys and against permitting access to bus lanes by hackneys. I have no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys at this time.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1999, provide for a range of improvements to the regulatory framework for taxis and hackneys, following discussions with the various interests concerned. In relation to hackneys, the regulations, which will come into operation on 1 March 2000, make new provisions for limited external identification of vehicles, the use of two-way radios and telephonic equipment and the carrying of a log of agreed fares.</P>

      <P>Castlebar Urban District Council submitted an application on 25 November 1997 under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990 for my consent to the compulsory acquisition of sites at Castle Street, Castlebar. I refused consent to the acquisition of one of the sites on 15 June 1999 on the grounds that my Department's inspector reported that the property was not derelict. The reason why the application on the remaining sites was not decided within the normal period related to the fact that initially there had been a planning application for development of the site. Later, contacts between my Department and Castlebar Urban District Council indicated that a decision should be deferred pending the outcome of pre-planning discussions which the council was conducting in relation to the site. On 17 January 2000 the urban district council informed my Department that no planning application had been received following the pre-planning discussions and that if the Minister's consent is granted they will proceed to acquire the properties to render them non-derelict. In these circumstances, I will give my decision on the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-06 estimates that some 500,000 additional new dwellings will need to be provided over the next ten years to meet demand. To ensure that this demand is met in a coherent and planned way, Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will require local authorities to prepare housing strategies as part of their development plans. Each housing strategy must provide for the current and future housing needs in the area of the development plan and should include policies which encourage housing types and sizes which meet the different categories of demand, including the needs of first time buyers and those in need of social housing. I have asked local authority managers to undertake preparatory work on their housing strategies in anticipation of enactment of the Bill. I am satisfied at the level of housing output generally that has been achieved in 1999.</P>
      <P>All local authorities have been requested to submit details of their local authority housing programmes for the current year to my Department by the end of January or as soon as possible thereafter.

Under the national development plan the number of households whose social and affordable housing needs will be met over the next four years will be 50,000.</P>

      <P>The free electricity allowance is available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are either in receipt of a welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses were in receipt of the allowance, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the free electricity allowance is that the applicant must be living alone or living only with certain excepted people as follows: a qualified adult, and-or dependent child(ren) under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education, and-or a person who is disabled (medical certification must be provided), and-or a person who would qualify for the allowance in his/her own right and-or a person providing the applicant or another person living with the applicant with constant care and attention if the applicant or that other person is disabled. Medical certification must be supplied.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 made provision for the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes will be extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the Policy Institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series in March 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to <Col N="661" /> provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week  &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash;  is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April regardless of the temperature.</P>
    <P>The conditions that apply to the national fuel scheme require that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the living alone condition. To satisfy the living alone condition a person must be either living alone or with a dependant spouse-partner, a dependant child, a carer for the applicant, a person in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department or a person in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>If the applicant has a combined household income of over £30 per week in excess of the relevant maximum contributory pension or savings of over £22,400 or is living in a household with someone who is not included in the living alone conditions then the applicant is not eligible for a fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>Farm assist is a means-tested scheme providing weekly income support to low-income farmers. The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is factual and is designed to reflect the actual net income, that is, gross income less any expenses necessarily incurred, to the applicant from farming. Means are not determined by reference to the value of cattle held on the farm. Income and expenditure figures for the preceeding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year. However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation. Income from the sale of animals is taken into account where it occurs.</P>
      <P>Each applicant for farm assist is given a copy of the report upon which entitlement is determined and may request a review if he or she is not satisfied with the basis of the assessment. In addition, an applicant who is not happy with a decision given may appeal it to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>I should mention that, for the purpose of determining the rate of farm assist payable, deductions are allowed from net income in respect of qualified children and the balance is assessed at 80%. In this regard, the means test is more favourable than the scheme's predecessor, the unemployment assistance scheme for small-holders.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The monthly CSO report on the Consumer Price Index which was published last week highlights that over the whole of 1999 prices increased on average by 1.6%. As social welfare rates were increased by between 4% and 8.3% from the beginning of June, 1999, this means that these increases were well ahead of average annual inflation for the year and represented real increases of between 2.4% and 6.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £423 million on a full year basis, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a £7 a week increase for pensioners and a £4 a week increase <Col N="663" /> for all other social welfare recipients. As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid 4 weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance indicated that taking account of the various measures which he was introducing in the Budget, annual average inflation for 2000 is expected to be 3%. Therefore, these increases are again well ahead of expected inflation, representing real increases ranging between 2.1% and 5.7%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is raising the issue of individualisation in the social welfare code in that this issue affects mainly women.</P>
      <P>Individualisation of the social welfare system was considered in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting, and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group noted that individualisation already exists to a certain extent, firstly, in the social insurance system to the extent that those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>The group considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been achieved in this area over the last 12 years with coverage being extended to the self employed, 1988, part-time workers, 1991, and new civilpublic servants, 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group also proposed, on foot of research on equivalence scales undertaken by the ESRI for the group, that the qualified adult allowance should be increased to 70% of the personal rate. The Government intends to reach this recommended level for the QAA over a period of three budgets and the process was started in the recent budget with increases of between 8% to 17% being provided. In principle, the QAA <Col N="664" /> rate is set at less than 100% of the personal rate on the basis that there are economies of scale where two people live together in the same household, and that account should be taken of these economies where the second person does not have a direct entitlement to the payment in his/her own right.</P>
    <P>The group also considered that a general system of administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of the QAA direct to the person concerned should be introduced. The question of making such separate payments in all cases involves some complex social issues which need to be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of the qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment. In addition there would be some administrative and cost implications. The position in relation to individualisation overall in the social welfare code will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is responsible for navigation on the River Shannon and one of its principal duties is to ensure that there is adequate water depth for the navigation of boats on the system. This activity applies almost exclusively to the cruising season, from mid-March to October, as only a few hundred of the 75,000 boat passages through the locks annually occur during the winter months.</P>
      <P>Water levels in the three main lakes on the river &ndash; Loughs Allen, Ree and Derg &ndash; are controlled by the ESB. Water levels-depths in the river between these lakes are controlled by Dúchas for navigation purposes by means of a series of weirs with sluices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> As the Deputy is also aware, Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways, has been established under the British-Irish Agreement. Waterways Ireland has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout this island, principally for recreational purposes. Waterways Ireland took charge of the Shannon-Erne Waterway on 2 December last and, on 1 April next, will take over the rest of the South's waterways for which Dúchas now has responsibility, namely the Shannon navigation, the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow navigation. Waterways Ireland is responsible to the North-South Ministerial Council in which I will participate with my colleague Minister McGimpsey of the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
    <P>The issue of an overall Shannon Authority has to be placed in the context of these North-South arrangements and in the context of the responsibilities of other Ministers. It would be inappropriate of me to comment on this question at this stage.</P>

      <P>As it is rated as a List 1 building in the 1999 Dublin City Development Plan, the Monastery Chapel of St. Alphonsus has been, since January 1 of this year, a protected structure under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1999. This protection covers both the exterior of the chapel and its magnificent interior.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to you on October 7, the powers provided by this new Act provide the best method for protecting our architectural heritage. The acquisition of the chapel is, therefore, not necessary to ensure its preservation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the developers, they maintain that they wish to ensure that the architectural integrity of the chapel is protected in a manner which does not conflict with their legitimate interest in building apartments in the grounds. They initially entered into discussions with An Taisce, local community groups and the religious order with a view to forming a trust which would provide for the chapel's future use. When these discussions proved inconclusive, the chapel was placed on the market in the hope of finding a buyer who could provide it with a suitable use. As far as I am aware, no buyer has, as yet, been found.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of last year, officials from my Department entered into discussions with the developer regarding the provision of a use for the chapel which will not adversely affect its interior, while being mindful of the residential nature of the development. The discussions are ongoing at the moment.</P>

      <P>The law already contains directions to the court on issues concerning the upbringing of a child where parents cannot agree on such matters.</P>
      <P>Policy in the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, is that the court must, in deciding matters relating to the custody of and access to children, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to that important criterion, which is applicable in many other jurisdictions, the same Act empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning children and the court has powers to enforce any orders made.</P>
      <P>The Children Act, 1997, inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to specify that the court has discretion whether or not to order joint custody. In the course of passage of the Bill, I strengthened its provisions in this area with a provision that the court, in making decisions in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The court must also, under a provision inserted by the Act of 1997, consider the wishes of the child in suitable cases.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, in the best interests of all concerned when parents can agree the arrangements in relation to the custody of and access to their children, rather than have the courts decide the matter. Of importance in this context is that the Act of 1997 places a new emphasis on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms involving counselling and mediation and obliges solicitors acting for the parties to bring the possibilities offered by such procedures to the attention of their clients. It is well recognised that, where couples are separating, counselling and mediation can offer lasting effects which may benefit themselves and their children. The Government has allocated substantial extra funding for the development of counselling and mediation services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy context of the decision of the Government to plan for a system of providing directly for the needs of asylum seekers is the range of measures taken in other EU countries to control illegal immigration and to manage the processing of cases of those who seek asylum and refugee status and in particular the decision of the UK to move to a system of direct provision by April 2000. Given that we maintain a common travel area with the UK which is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and Irish people generally, a decision of this character by the UK has to be taken into consideration very seriously by any Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of direct provision in this State will simply bring us in line with other member states. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum matters is by far the best approach and in introducing this system I am satisfied that it will represent a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum population. There is a widespread assumption <Col N="674" /> that direct provision automatically represents a lesser standard of service to asylum seekers but I can assure the House that the introduction of this system will follow careful planning and investigation.</P>
    <P>The Government decided on 9 November to establish a central directorate to arrange for the dispersal of asylum seekers to locations throughout the country and to plan for a system of direct provision for their basic needs. A system of vouchers is only one option to be considered by the directorate which will be consulting widely with relevant Departments, agencies and non-governmental organisations before making recommendations on the most appropriate system of providing directly for asylum seeker needs.</P>
    <P>A system of direct provision will for the most part represent a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for funding suitable accommodation, for providing health and education services and other essential needs. Genuine asylum seekers who are actually fleeing persecution, will, I am satisfied, welcome this service and are unlikely to view it as a diminution in the quality of the services provided by the State, given that one of its purposes is to prevent fraud.</P>
    <P>An overall policy, in this regard, is being developed and my Department is consulting with the relevant agencies and NGOs. Meetings have been held with project managers of health boards and county managers and a day long seminar was held on Friday 21 January with relevant interest groups and NGOs.</P>
    <P>I will shortly bring before the Government proposals outlining the strategy for the dispersal of asylum seekers and for meeting their needs through direct provision.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the establishment of the central directorate for the dispersal of asylum seekers and direct provision on a number of occasions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the immediate task of the directorate is to ensure that the housing needs of asylum seekers are met as I and the Government are conscious that the essential requirement of shelter must be the first priority, the directorate is currently consulting with Departments, state agencies and non-governmental organisations with a view to devising a planned and orderly system of dispersal which will be sensitive to the needs of not alone the family unit but to the cultures and <Col N="675" /> ethnic background of the applicants. It will be a primary function of the directorate to ensure that the facilities available to those in the greater Dublin area will be also available to those dispersed and proper structures and procedures will be put in place to allow for its smooth operation. Dispersal will not in any way disadvantage those who are located in areas outside of Dublin. Such locations will be chosen where the support services for the asylum seeker are in place or can be put in place without delay.</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the Garda Authorities that, as bus lanes are considered to be a critical element of the public transport system, special Garda attention is afforded to them.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that between 35 and 40 motorcycles patrol the main arteries and orbital routes throughout the Dublin metropolitan region on a daily basis and that part of the operational plan implemented is the policing of quality bus corridors and bus lanes. I understand that, in general, there is broad compliance with the bus lane regulations by the majority of motorists and where offences take place appropriate action, including prosecutions are taken. In this regard, during 1999, a total of 6,480 prosecutions were instituted for bus lane infringements. The Deputy may be interested to know that the gardaí avail of closed circuit television and traffic control cameras to monitor bus lanes and general motorist behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that where there is evidence of non-compliance with the bus lane regulations intensive <Col N="676" /> patrolling is arranged for a period of time and follow up Garda research has indicated that general compliance has improved as a result.</P>
    <P>I might add that the gardaí attend monthly meetings with the other agencies involved in traffic management including each Dublin local authority, Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transportation Office to discuss the implementation and progress of quality bus corridor and cycle routes through the Dublin metropolitan region. It should be noted that issues concerning enforcement are raised at this forum and that the gardaí have been complimented there on the enforcement of the bus lane regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that inter-agency co-operation on the issue of bus lanes will continue and that daily liaison between the Garda Síochána and the local authorities on traffic management issues, including bus lane enforcement, is continuing.</P>

This group had its first meeting in September last and has reported to me on the necessary steps to bring the Act into operation. Following on this, I have announced the setting up of the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and have appointed Mr. Richard Langford as chairperson.</P>
      <P>The new authority is being set up on an interim basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis. The task of the designate authority will be to commence work on the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and to advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as provided for in the Act. The process of securing nominations to the designate authority, as set out in the Act, is already under way.  </P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of section 29(8) of the Act enables the Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the independent review group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, on Waterford Institute of Technology. When the relevant sections of the Act are brought into operation it is intended that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland will be directed under the terms of this section to implement the recommendations of the report of the review group.</P>

      <P>Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education, primary teaching, in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate colleges of education now follow a course module on special education. This module covers the broad range of issues in special education, including issues such as those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the Church of Ireland and Coláiste Mhuire, Marino colleges of education, particular attention is paid to special needs and learning difficulties arising from various factors under &ldquo;method studies&rdquo; in English and mathematics.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Froebel College of Education, students have a course module under remedial work. This deals with learning difficulties arising from special needs, again including issues such as those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I set up an expert group in 1999 to examine the content and duration of pre-service teacher education programmes, primary, in the colleges of education. The issues mentioned by the Deputy are being raised as part of that review. The report of the review group should be completed later this year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of third level colleges have no campus accommodation and I am conscious of the serious supply pressure which exists in relation to student accommodation. Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999 was introduced specifically to relieve some of the pressure by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students and therefore I do not propose to intervene further at this stage.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to suggest that the school to which the Deputy refers is being dis<Col N="682" /> criminated against in terms of remedial teacher support.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999 the remedial teacher service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
      <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being below the 10th percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where the post is shared with one other school, the committee recommended that the caseload be reduced to 38 pupils.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers currently shares a remedial teacher with another school. The combined enrolment of the two schools is 374 pupils. In these circumstances, the allocation of one remedial teacher is in line with the general approach recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>The needs of the school in question will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>A study of remedial education in Irish primary schools was conducted in 1996-98. The summary report of this study was published in 1998. The terms of reference of the review were: the basis on which pupils are selected for remedial teaching; the number of pupils receiving remedial teaching in different subjects &ndash; English, mathematics, Irish; the number of pupils receiving remedial teaching from individual remedial teachers; the nature of the diagnostic assessment conducted by remedial teachers; the objectives set by remedial teachers and class teachers for pupils receiving remedial teaching, and the links between those objectives and baseline assessment; the teaching methods and resources used by remedial teachers to support pupils with learning difficulties; the general approaches to remedial teaching; the methods used by remedial teachers to record and report assessment outcomes; the nature and quality of the relationships/ partnerships involving class teachers, remedial teachers and parents; the progress made by pupils in remedial classes; and the duration of remedial teaching for individual pupils.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme <Col N="685" /> is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
      <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issuing of these grants to schools. Due to the need to develop an IT programme, and the necessity to verify all school enrolments for September 1999, it is expected that these grants will issue to schools in March of this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget, over the next two years, which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>

    <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced <Col N="686" /> in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £15 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
    <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under this scheme.

The Deputy will be aware that the standard <i>per capita</i> rates payable to voluntary secondary schools was increased from £177 to £184 last year and a further increase of £8 is planned for this year with <i>pro rata</i> increases for other schools.</P>
    <P>The matter of equity of funding between the sectors was examined recently by a representative steering group drawn from the second level sector with a view to making recommendations for an equitable and transparent basis of funding for all second level schools. I expect to be in a position to publish the group's report shortly and its recommendations will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am aware of the needs of schools in relation to caretaking services and I am committed to improving existing provision this year and in future years in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>
