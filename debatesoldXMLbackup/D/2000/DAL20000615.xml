      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked at extraordinarily short notice to assent to or participate in a very complex debate. The resolution which has been published runs to quite a number of pages of fairly dense and complex legislation. It is an extraordinarily flippant way to treat this House. If the issue of housing was not so serious and if these measures were not so long overdue, we would not be giving our parliamentary assent.</P>
      <P>The House is being derelict in its duty in rushing through legislation which cannot be adequately scrutinised. We will have to take the assurances of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach in good faith because we do not have any other way of satisfying ourselves that the measures being proposed can be adequately scrutinised. In assenting to this particular measure, it is a bad day for the legislative process but an essential one for people who have been squeezed out of the housing market by the incompetence of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn on this issue. We in Fine Gael are also agreeing to this measure with great reluctance in view of the speed with which it has been presented to us. Legislation will be introduced next week and it should not be rushed through the House. It should be given proper scrutiny next week, although the decisions will have to be made today which will predicate that legislation. We are caught in the sense that we want to see measures which will allow first time buyers into the housing market and, therefore, we do not want to delay this measure being taken by the Government. However, this is not the way to run a Government. The Government should be better able to direct its business in a way which gives this House more time to scrutinise the legislation which is complex. We will accept this proposal reluctantly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What proposals does the Government have to tackle the levels of illiteracy, given</P>
      <P>today's very damaging report which indicates that 25% of the population is effectively illiterate allied to the child poverty levels and the fact that a recent survey showed that 91% of small firms are finding it difficult to find staff? Nothing seems to have happened since the Government came to office to bring down these levels. We hear promises but see no action. What will the Taoiseach do about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On No.<i> a</i>15, the Financial Motion, I thank the Opposition parties for their co-operation in taking the resolution today. We all know it is a Financial Resolution similar to a budget day resolution and cannot be circulated well in advance, otherwise it is open to all the difficulties of a Financial Resolution where people get around it and make decisions based on it. That is why there was short notice. The Bill will be before the House next week when there can be further debate. I thank Opposition parties for their co-operation.</P>
      <P>The OECD report issued yesterday to which Deputy Owen referred shows Ireland performing poorly in regard to levels of adult literacy. It includes data which have been in the public sphere for a few years and restates that we have a problem in this area. As the Deputy knows, there was almost nothing in the budget three years ago for adult literacy but now an enormous amount of money has now been put into proper adult literacy programmes. The report shows that the problem lies particularly among older people who did not benefit from the expansion of second level education. It is an area to which we have given a high priority and have dramatically increased adult literacy funding. The figure was £800,000 when we took office and it is now in excess of £10 million. This provision is at the core of the forthcoming White Paper on adult education which the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, will bring forward shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept these very high levels of adult literacy cause great hardship in families and mean that people who could contribute to the economy by taking up employment are probably prevented from doing so, leading to the high levels of staff vacancies that exist? The Government stands indicted by the fact that the figure in the OECD report is so high and it is time it took more active action.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an enormous improvement both as regards older people and the adult education schemes that have been put in place. I had the pleasure of attending the annual meeting of the committee on education last year. Because it now has resources it has been able to develop nationwide. Out of a potential workforce of 1.8 million there are approximately 30,000 in the long-term unemployment category. The number has decreased in the past three years from over 12% to under 2% which is probably <Col N="564" /> the highest and most dramatic recovery in long-term unemployment in the OECD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There could have been face to face consultation. We need to look at the fall-out rate of students who do not complete primary or secondary education. There is a growing level of illiteracy in that category. It is not confined, as the Taoiseach's remarks would suggest, to people who, for whatever reason, are now in adulthood and cannot read. There is a problem with young people dropping out of the school system and we do not have an adequate way to measure that let alone prevent it.</P>
      <P>Now that we are just two weeks away from adjourning for the summer recess until October, when will we see the Government's legislative proposals for standards in public life?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in legislation which is going through the House and in current legislation. Cutting hedgerows at this time of the year is a serious crime. It is happening all over the country. Something should be done about it. What will the Minister do about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, in light of the serious report that 15 tonnes of uranium at Sellafield nearly ignited as a result of the decommissioning work, does the Taoiseach agree that the civil defence Bill needs to be brought in urgently? This would have been another Windscale '57 fire had it not been avoided. Does he agree this is a serious matter that needs to be addressed?</P>
      <P>As regards the firearms and firearms certificates for non-residents Bill, will it delay the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill because it will amend the Wildlife Act, 1976? Is there any conflict between publication of that Bill by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the one by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands?</P>

      <P>As regards the legislative matter raised by Deputy Deasy, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands said last week that the county councils were monitoring the position. Obviously they are in flagrant breach of the legislation. I have raised the issue of the general register office by way of question on a number of occasions. As we enter the peak tourism season this matter requires action by three Ministers &ndash; the Ministers for Health and Children, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Tourism, Sport and Recreation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall the concerns expressed in this House on Report Stage, and in the select committee, on the position of victims of child sexual abuse who had been unable to institute civil proceedings within the normal limitation period because of the psychological disability caused by that abuse, and who have since emerged from that disability. The concern was that even though some of those victims had, by coming forward, brought about the successful criminal prosecution of their abusers, the Bill as framed would not avail them because by the time it became law those people would once again be out of time by reference to the new rule in the Bill covering that psychological disability.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this question I pointed to serious concerns on issues of legal principle arising out of the approach taken in Opposition amendments in seeking to address this point. I gave a commitment to the House on Report Stage that I would examine these issues with a view to bringing forward proposals to address the concerns of Deputies, if possible, consistent with legal principle.</P>
      <P>Following careful consideration of the matter in consultation with the office of the Attorney General, I was in a position to bring forward proposals on Report Stage in the Seanad. Those amendments were accepted by that House with support from all sides and I hope Deputies on all sides of this House will also be able to support my proposals.</P>
      <P>The concept of limitation periods in civil cases is a feature of legal systems generally. It enables persons to assert their rights while providing for some certainty of the legal position of both parties. It can be argued that it is a breach of normal legal principle not to apply such a concept if by so doing it would lead to a provision which would treat people differently by effectively removing the disability rule in some cases while others would have to prove the abuse was of such significance that their will or ability to make a reasoned decision to bring an action was substantially impaired. This could lead to a situation where abuse which arose before the passing of the Bill would be treated on a different basis from abuse arising after the passing of the legislation. It could thus be argued that the legislation would discriminate between certain classes of person and abuse on a basis that is open to challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When analogous changes were made to the limitation law in 1991 by way of the introduction of the rule of discoverability, persons were not treated differently by reference to different rules. A significant departure from the norm, however, was that the 1991 legislation applied to all causes <Col N="570" /> of action accruing before the commencement of that legislation. This was on the basis that to apply the normal rule disallowing retrospection would frustrate the objective of the reform. That approach to retrospection has been followed in the Bill following my amendment as agreed by the select committee of this House.</P>
    <P>The amendments before the House treat those cases of past sexual abuse which do not benefit from the provisions in the Bill in a way that targets them specifically so the limitation period could be reviewed in respect of them and begin to run again. This approach avoids the serious difficulty that could be created if the amendments tabled at earlier Stages in this House were to be successfully challenged. That risk would exist if we were to adopt those amendments and could produce a result which no one on any side of the House would want &ndash; that of undermining the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>Seanad amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are of a piece. The aim of the amendments, taken together, is to address the cases of sex abuse in childhood where the victim had suffered from the psychological disability which inhibits many victims from being able to take the steps necessary to pursue litigation within the normal limitation period, but had emerged from that disability at a time before the commencement of the present Bill. Such persons are out of time under the statute as it stands. Without these amendments the Bill would not alter that fact, except for the relatively small number of victims whose disability had ended within three years before the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 represents the kernel of the Government's proposals. It is directed at people who have demonstrably emerged from the psychological effects of the sex abuse in childhood which prevented them from taking the necessary steps to commence civil proceedings. It gives them an opportunity to commence such proceedings within 12 months after the passing of the present Bill, even though they would have been out of time under the present limitation rules or under the new disability rule in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment will ensure that victims of past child sex abuse who had made a criminal complaint about that abuse at a Garda station will have an opportunity to take civil proceedings against those responsible for the abuse, even though they were outside the normal limitation period for civil proceedings when they made the complaint. The amendment will also apply to victims who in the past decided not to go ahead with civil proceedings because they had been given professional legal advice that they were out of time; this applies irrespective of whether civil proceedings were commenced.</P>
    <P>Where a person has already taken civil proceedings, which were pursued to a final judgment, this new provision will not operate to reopen such a case; this would be a serious breach of the legal principle that there should be finality in litigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Amendment No. 2 sets out what is to be treated as a final judgment, a judgment where the time for bringing an appeal is past and an appeal was not made; a judgment where an appeal cannot be brought, for instance, a judgment of the Supreme Court on appeal from the High Court; and a case where judgment was delivered and a subsequent appeal was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, taken together, insert into the new section 48A of the Statute of Limitations an additional definition of &ldquo;professional legal advice&rdquo;. This makes it clear that the new provision applies irrespective of whether civil proceedings were commenced.</P>
    <P>On the basis that these amendments in large measure go towards meeting the concerns expressed in this House as well as in the Seanad on the difficult issue of this aspect of retrospective operation of the Bill, I ask Deputies to support the Government proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the progress made on this issue. I thank the Minister, his officials and advisers for addressing the question of victims who reported child abuse to the Garda or had sought legal advice on it. I acknowledge that the Minister has found a wording that is acceptable legally to him. It provides that people who might otherwise have been excluded from the scope of the Bill can take an action within a year.</P>
      <P>That shows the importance of the procedure of debating a Bill from when it is initiated until it is passed. Our attention was brought to this matter by people who were directly involved in taking actions on behalf of people who had suffered abuse as children. That the information was in the public domain and we were able to discuss this matter with victims and their legal representatives and we were able to debate it with the Minister in this House and in the Seanad has resulted in our finding, what I think will be, an acceptable solution. It does not go as far as we would like, but it provides an opportunity for those victims to take an action.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the procedures of the House allow the Minister to respond to a point I wish to put to him. The wording of the amendment is &ldquo;that an action may be brought&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;may be brought&rdquo; is fairly generalised and queues for court listings and so on will have to be contended with. Therefore, I want to be sure that people will have to take only the very initial procedures involved in taking an action in the year to be covered by this provision.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I join Deputy O'Sullivan in welcoming the Minister's amendments. He will <Col N="572" /> recall that on Committee Stage we argued strongly for something of this nature. I moved an amendment which states, for one year following the coming into force of this section, any person who heretofore was statute barred from bringing an action for an offence to which this Act refers, shall be able to process such action, notwithstanding the fact that he or she ceased to be under a disability for more than six years prior to the coming into effect of this Act. The Minister did not see his way to accepting that amendment.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Sullivan I, too, welcome that the Minister and his officials have addressed the issue and have managed to come up with a constitutionally and legally sound formula. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, it largely meets our concerns. Inevitably as happens in such circumstances, certain people will still be excluded, but lines must be drawn somewhere in all legislation. By and large we welcome that the Minister tabled these amendments in the Seanad, that they are before the House and we hope they will pass into law almost immediately.</P>
      <P>It would be manifestly wrong to enact this Bill and exclude from its terms those people who had come to the realisation they were sexually abused, went through that mental, psychological and physical torment and still bear those scars, had the initiative to do something about it, reported it to the Garda and went to a solicitor and were legally advised that under the Statute of Limitations it was not possible for them to take a civil action. This is an extremely good Bill. I compliment Deputy O'Sullivan on her initiative in introducing her Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on Committee and Report Stages Deputy O'Sullivan and I advocated strongly and tabled amendments to the effect that physical as well as sexual abuse should be included within the terms of reference of the Bill. We cogently put the point that in the majority of cases the abuse was physical rather than sexual, although sometimes it was a combination of both. We made the point that given that sexual abuse makes the headlines, a large group of people, whose emotional, psychological and physical scars and suffering are just as real as those who suffered sexual abuse, feel excluded from the terms of the Bill. We have been contacted by droves of people, many of whom were brought up in institutions, who feel that given that this legislation is being enacted, now is the time to include in law a provision dealing with the physical as well as the sexual abuse suffered by those people during their deprived and miserable childhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was unable to accept the amendment we tabled on the basis that the issue was before the Law Reform Commission. It had been before it for a considerable period at that stage. It was before it when Report Stage was taken and when the Bill was taken in the Seanad. Will the Minister indicate to the House if any definitive advice has come from the Law Reform Com<Col N="573" /> mission on the need to include physical as well as sexual abuse within the terms of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy O'Sullivan's question first, amendment No. 1 provides that the writ must be issued. In other words, the proceedings must commence within 12 months of the passage of the legislation. Once the writ is issued, the person is protected under limitation law. We are not talking about the case being concluded. That would not be practicable, as I do not believe any case of this nature would be finalised within a year. In those circumstances, that should reassure Deputy O'Sullivan and others who would be concerned about the precise wording of the legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Higgins's question relating to physical abuse, I outlined the Government's position on that. The matter has been referred to the Law Reform Commission and I am awaiting its report. I understand a consultative paper will be published on this matter in the not too distant future. In terms of explaining the complexity of what is involved, it is significant that a consultative paper will be the first step in the process. That indicates to me that the Law Reform Commission regards this matter as extremely complex. Otherwise it would have simply issued a report. The matter is extremely complex because it is not merely a question of defining what is or is not physical abuse but of deciding what level of physical abuse there has been which would lead to the victim having a psychological disability in pursuing his or her claim. That is entirely different from the concept about which Deputy Higgins has been speaking. Deputy Higgins speaks about the subject as if we were dealing only with a definition of &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo;. That is manifestly not the case.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an extremely complex area. I have explained on numerous occasions that this matter was referred to the Law Reform Commission only because it was so complex. It may be that I will be proven wrong but my considered view is that the approach which will be taken to the whole issue of physical abuse will not be similar to the approach taken in the legislation dealing with sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to legislate when I have the Law Reform Commission Report. However, to legislate in a vacuum, without consideration of a report of that nature, would be extremely foolish. It would be negligence. I say that because certainty in the law is of paramount importance and it is of considerable importance that people who take an action in relation to physical abuse know precisely where they stand. It is also of considerable importance that their advisers and the courts know precisely what the position is. It is not a question of defining &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo; for the purposes of the legislation, but of defining the level of physical abuse which would lead the individual to have a psychological disability. I have challenged many people in the Oireachtas in recent months to produce an amendment which would <Col N="574" /> satisfy the criterion which has been laid down. Nobody has done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not done so is because the matter is so complex. What was in the Bill originally would not deal with the complexity of the matter. In that respect the Government has had to bring forward numerous amendments to ensure it would be effective. That is not to say I am taking away from Deputy O'Sullivan's initiative in bringing forward the legislation. I merely point out as a matter of justice to the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to the parliamentary draftsman and to the Attorney General their enormous contribution to this legislation. If it were the case that the physical abuse provision in the original Bill could have been utilised in such a way that it would satisfy the criterion laid down which is necessary, it would have been taken on board but the truth is, it was not. I accept this is an emotive subject but that does not mean I should allow my heart to rule my head on the matter. That would not satisfy anybody.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission which has done some sterling work on behalf of the State is independent in the exercise of its functions. It is an expert body and I am not in a position to force it to act in one way or another. I am satisfied that when it brings forward a consultative paper it will be based on the best legal knowledge available. I am also satisfied that following on the consultative process the Law Reform Commission will bring forward a proposal which will be solid and will stand the test of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response to my original question. On the second matter the Minister said that because the matter of physical abuse is so complex it could not be included in the legislation. I put it to the Minister that the same problem arises whether a person suffers from a psychological disability because of physical or sexual abuse. He still has to decide whether the abuse resulted in the psychological disability and if the person can avail of this legislation to take an action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been strongly argued to us by the SOCA organisation, the survivors of childhood abuse, that victims of abuse believe we should not differentiate between the different kinds of abuse. Everybody who has been abused feels the same pain and should have the same access to the law. <Col N="575" /> They are of the view that there would not be a distinction between the two kinds of abuse.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Education and Science, during the debate to set up the commission on child abuse, suggested that commission might have the power to recommend changes in regard to physical abuse. I would have thought the advice of the Law Reform Commission, which has already commenced its work, would be significant. Is it expected the commission on child abuse will also make recommendations in regard to this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the correlation between sexual abuse and the psychological disability which would have prevented an individual from pursuing his or her action is relatively clear-cut in cases of sexual abuse. However, the same correlation is not as easily defined in terms of physical abuse, in other words, it is far more difficult in dealing with a definition of &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo; which would lead to a psychological disability than in the case of sexual abuse. That does not mean we will not try to solve the problem. We have already taken substantial steps to do that. We are awaiting the consultative paper and then the Law Reform Commission will report. It is an indicator of the complexity of what is involved that the Law Reform Commission has decided to publish a consultative paper. In other words, the Law Reform Commission finds this a difficult problem. In the circumstances it must be clear that it is wise to wait for the consultative paper and the report.</P>
      <P>There will not be problems in legislating for physical abuse when we have a report which is cogent and clear. It is important that the matter be clear. I can do no more, if I could I would.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I am glad we can welcome a consultative report and that the matter will be clarified. I welcome the fact that the Law Reform Commission's work is ongoing. It is a pity the Minister had to revert to the bunker again and become his own bristly heckling self because we asked a civilised question in relation to what progress had been made and the reason a huge number of people felt excluded from the Bill. He was asked in a constructive fashion when the debate was proceeding at a civilised pace and then he decided to become his old self.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept this is a difficult area fraught with legal definitions of every description. It opens up the definition of corporal punishment in terms of its use in primary, secondary and vocational schools and in the home. We have in no way underestimated the degree of difficulty or complexity. However, between the Minister, his advisers and the Law Reform Commission, it should be possible to come up with a definition. The Minister will acknowledge he did not get right the definition of what constitutes sexual abuse and that as the debate evolved he encompassed additional areas, for example, causing the <Col N="576" /> victim to participate in or observe sexual activity and sexual activity carried out in the presence of the person. He gave sexual abuse a broader definition than intended originally. That is good and is what the democratic process in which we participate in this House by drafting legislation is all about, to improve legislation and ensure the finished product is as perfect and final as possible.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask the Minister to come up with a definition of physical abuse and to ensure that it is included in legislation as early as possible. We are making that request on behalf of the huge number of people affected. I am sure the Department advised the Minister that when this Bill was introduced by Deputy O'Sullivan, it precipitated a huge volume of requests from people, through the media, to be included in the terms of reference of the Bill. We accept this is difficult but it is an issue which must be addressed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to understand where Deputy Higgins is coming from in relation to sexual abuse. He alleged that I did not know where I was going when I included additional areas in the Bill. There was no definition of sexual abuse when Deputy O'Sullivan presented the Bill, which is why I had to introduce a precise definition of sexual abuse. If I have to fill vacuums of information for Deputy Higgins and he accuses me of hectoring, perhaps I would be better off keeping my views to myself.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for being his usual magnanimous self and I thank his officials. Deputy Shatter introduced an excellent Bill parallel to that of Deputy O'Sullivan. The two Bills complemented each other, which was useful and assisted the process. We have done a good day's work by putting in place legislation which is long overdue and seeks to redress a huge anomaly in people's entitlement to bring civil proceedings, which up to now had been barred by statute.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the approach taken by the promoter of the Bill to the debate on the difficult and sensitive issues which surround it. I have endeavoured to address these issues in a measured way. That has also been the approach of the promoters of the Bill in this House and the Seanad. I acknowledge the co-operative way in which the promoters dealt with the extensive drafting changes brought about by Government amendments. There is acceptance on all sides of the House that the Bill in its present form is greatly improved in comparison with the text as introduced. I pay tribute to those working in the parliamentary draftsman's office whose work does not always attract the credit it deserves. That is not to denigrate the promoters of the Bill who do not have available to them the repository of expertise available officially and who face a difficult task, as I know from my experience in bringing forward Private Members' legislation.</P>

      <Col N="578" /> I repeat my assurance that I will respond promptly and proactively to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the issue of limitation periods in non-sexual abuse cases, whenever those are made. I thank the officials in my Department for the tremendous expertise which they brought to bear on this difficult and complex legislation. This is a tremendous tribute to their unquestioned abilities. It is important that I acknowledge that publicly.</P>

    <Title>Planning and Development Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 49:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 33, line 14, after &ldquo;establishments,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including, where appropriate, the modification of any such development carried out after the coming into effect of that Directive),&rdquo;.&ndash;(Deputy Dukes).</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to a provision in section 10 relating to the major accidents directive, known as the Seveso directive. The section requires the development plan to have regard to the control of sites that come under the provisions of the major accidents directive. The Bill proposes that included in the matters which the planning authority must take into account in relation to these sites in drawing up its development plan are the siting of new establishments, the modification of existing establishments and development in the vicinity of such establishments. That is proper and correct but some issues arise which go slightly further than what is contemplated in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will not mention individual sites by name because that would be invidious. I know of one site which falls within the definition of the major accidents directive because substances are kept there which could cause serious complications if anything went wrong. At the time that installation was first put in place, we did not have the major accidents directive. It was put in a particular place because that suited &ndash; I am not saying the people who did it at the time were reckless, far from it. However, we did not know as much as we do now and we had not had an incident like Seveso. Within a short distance of that site there is substantial residential development and a hotel. If that installation was proposed on that site now, it would not be allowed under the provisions of the major accidents directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section of the Bill requires the planning authorities to have regard to these considerations because it refers to development in the vicinity of such establishments. I put the following consideration to the Minister which arises in connection with another matter which I will deal with later. There are cases in this country where installations have been put in place which fall within the ambit <Col N="579" /> of the major accidents directive where there is no development nearby but where, in the course of time, there has been development nearer the site. The planning authorities are now being given the job, rightly, of considering the dangers because we did not always know what they were. The clear intent of this provision is that we can require the operators of those sites to modify their operations in certain ways to take account of the dangers.</P>
    <P>I propose that in the interests of fairness and equity we should also allow the planning authorities to require people who have carried out subsequent development in the areas we believe might be affected to reconsider their development. It goes back to an old principle I spoke of in the House some time ago, which relates to the mundane business of piggeries. Planning authorities around the country have problems with people complaining about the smell from piggeries. I have always been of the view it is most unfair to put limitations on someone operating a piggery because someone else has built a house within smelling distance of it. One is not entitled to complain about a piggery that was there when one built the house. Similarly, if the situation where someone carries out a development within what turns out to be the danger zone of a major accidents directive site is to be remedied, the person who carried out the subsequent development should at least be considered as one of the people who can be required to take action.</P>
    <P>A similar question arises later in the Bill in relation to quarries, which we may not get time to deal with in detail. We are creating a system in the Bill under which quarry owners may have their operations restricted because of the effect on surrounding areas. There are many cases around the country where development has taken place in the vicinity of quarries. That is similar to a piggery or a major accident directive site. If people knowingly build within the dust drift vicinity of a quarry, within the influence of blasting operations in a quarry or within the area where the noise from the quarry can be heard and if we want to rectify that situation, it is just to allow planning authorities to require those who carried out the subsequent development to modify that development, rather than putting the whole onus on the original developer of the major accident site, piggery or quarry.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49, which I hope the Minister accepts, is designed simply to allow the planning authorities have regard to that side of the equation, as well as looking at the actual development itself that is at the root of the problem. That is why I propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;including, where appropriate, the modification of any such development carried out after the coming into effect of that Directive&rdquo;, that is, the major accidents directive. I have tabled a later amendment with a similar intent in relation to quarries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would provide that an objective to control development due to the risk of a major accident would also relate to the modification of developments carried out after the Seveso directive comes into force. This is unnecessary because the definition of development in section 3 includes any works carried out, unless specifically exempted. Therefore, any modifications to existing development would constitute development, unless they consist of smallscale works, such as domestic extensions.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to control new development, which includes modifications. The provision in this section only comes into operation where someone applies for planning permission. It is not intended to apply to existing development. I consider the amendment to be unnecessary and I ask for it to be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree the effect of the section is as the Minister has said. This section deals with the content of development plans. The specific provision I wish to amend by adding words to it says:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a development plan shall include objectives for . . .</P>
      <P>(j) the control, having regard to the provisions of the Major Accidents Directive and any regulations, under any enactment, giving effect to that Directive, of&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) siting of new establishments [that is, new development],</P>
      <P>(ii) modification of existing establishments [that is, development in the major accident sites], and</P>
      <P>(iii) development in the vicinity of such establishments.</P>
      <P>The Minister is telling me that &ldquo;development in the vicinity of such establishments&rdquo; can mean modifications to existing developments. The section goes on to state &ldquo;for the purposes of reducing the risk, or limiting the consequences, of a major accident&rdquo;. What the Minister is telling me might be strictly true within the meaning of that. However, I submit it will always be read as meaning that the planning authority will look at what can be done in the establishment itself to modify the risk.</P>
      <P>I want to make that clear by adding to that sentence so that it reads &ldquo;for the purposes of reducing the risk, or limiting the consequences, of a major accident (including, where appropriate, the modification of any such development carried out after the coming into effect of that Directive)&rdquo;. The Minister may tell me that is implicit in subsection (2)(j)(iii). However, I would like to make it explicit, so that there is no doubt about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have very much to add to what I already said. The reason subparagraphs <Col N="581" /> (i) and (ii) refer to the siting and modification of establishments is that we are using the language of the directive rather than the term &ldquo;development&rdquo; under the Bill. The only matter that can be considered when an application for planning permission is made is the precise nature of that application itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking not only about planning applications but about the obligation there is on a planning authority to look at the existing situation on the ground. A planning authority is not simply obliged to say &ldquo;There is an explosives factory in Enfield, County Meath, which has been there since the year dot, it will always be there and we will do nothing about it&rdquo;. It is required, under the provisions of the major accidents directive, to keep the matter under review to ensure safety is continuously monitored. All I am asking the Minister to do is to make explicit in the section something which he tells me is implicit in it, but which I want to be brought specifically to the attention of planning authorities in the drawing up of the development plans by simply adding these words to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m) a list of public rights of way.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the provisions for public rights of way. My two amendments propose that a development plan should include a list of public rights of way and objectives for the preservation and protection of rights of way. There is a separate section in the Bill which deals with what is effectively the making of new public rights of way, for which it sets down a procedure. That procedure involves the notification of any landowner and provides an opportunity for submissions, appeals and so on to be made on that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the concerns I expressed on Committee Stage was that the section in the Bill which deals with rights of way will, instead of preserving and protecting them, have the effect of diminishing the number of public rights of way and dimin<Col N="582" /> ishing their protection. At present, public rights of way are in many cases claimed and exist by virtue of tradition rather than on paper. A public right of way will exist in an area, the local community will know of its existence and people will have regularly used it. However, it is often difficult to find documentary evidence for its existence.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to include in the development plan a list of such public rights of way where they are known to the public. When drafting the development plan, people in the community or the planning authority will be able to point out the traditional rights of way. People can make submissions in that regard and the rights of way will be either included or not included in the plan. The alternative procedure provided for in the Bill almost starts with the assumption that the right of way does not exist and the onus of proof that it should exist is effectively given to the local authority.</P>
    <P>The only rights of way which will get through are those processed under that procedure. Other rights of way which in many cases are long established will cease to be rights of way because they are not dealt with under that procedure. In other words, if the right of way does not go through the procedure provided for in the Bill, it is not a right of way. That position will be adopted by landowners when disputes arise.</P>
    <P>I am aware of relevant cases in my constituency. A person might put a fence across a laneway and include it in his or her garden or property. Often it is an older member of the community who will bring it to the attention of his or her public representative. He or she will point out that it has long been a public right of way saying: &ldquo;We walked there when we were children; it was the link from X road to Y road and has been used for generations&rdquo;. In that situation the onus of proof is on the landowner to show it is not a right of way. The problem that will now arise is that if the right of way has not gone through the procedure provided for in the Bill, it will effectively lapse.</P>
    <P>There must be specific provision in development plans for the lifting of public rights of way and for their preservation and protection. Unless the Bill puts that obligation on the local authorities and provides that they have the primary responsibility for ensuring public rights of way are preserved and protected, there will be a loss of the rights of way and, in particular, access to the countryside which people have enjoyed for generations.</P>
    <P>I doubt that it was the Minister's intention to create a system whereby rights of way are put at risk. However, that will be the effect of this section unless it is complemented with the amendments proposed by Deputy Dukes and me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, particularly in light of the discussion we had on Committee Stage. Deputy Gilmore and I tabled a number of amendments which sought to ensure <Col N="583" /> that public rights of way would be maintained. The Minister demurred and decided not to accept our proposals on the basis that if an obligation was put on local authorities to maintain rights of way, it would impose a cost on them and make them reluctant to agree to the nomination of any new rights of way.</P>
      <P>That might be true. We are all a little imperfect and we might react in that way, but that would be an undesirable result. It is for that reason I have put forward amendment No. 81 which seeks to establish a register of public rights of way and a procedure for establishing the register. This is not a procedure which allows Alan Dukes or anybody else to claim there is a public right of way in a certain place and have that claim accepted. It contains a procedure for affected landowners who believe there is no such right of way to contest it.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides a basis on which a register of public rights of way can be drawn up. It also provides that one year before it begins the process of reviewing the development plan, the local authority would publish the register of public rights of way so everybody would know where rights of way exist. That, together with the provision proposed by Deputy Gilmore and a provision which I hope will be eventually included in the legislation to provide that planning authorities will be obliged to maintain public rights of way, will preserve and enhance the value of these rights of way.</P>
      <P>Rights of way are in danger and the dangers are rather difficult to accept. I can give one example, an old hobbyhorse of mine. There are many miles of canal in this country. When I had the time I used to go horse riding along the banks of the canal in a certain part of my constituency. The canals were taken over by what was then the Office of Public Works which then became Dúchas and is now Waterways Ireland. After some time I discovered that a barrier had been erected at two points on the canal. I was told that the Office of Public Works had decided that horse riding along the banks of the canal was not an appropriate activity.</P>
      <P>I had several meetings with the relevant officials and Ministers of State and they solemnly listened when I explained that the banks of the canals had originally been built so heavy horses could pull barges along the canals. They were built for horses. For many years, the banks of the canals were virtually public thoroughfares. Not many people in the 19th century could afford a horse to ride along the canals but they had donkeys, and could walk. They walked along the canals and the banks were important thoroughfares for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Office of Public Works decided that horse riding along the banks of the canal was not an appropriate activity. The excuses offered were that it would interfere with anglers or with pedestrians. That is baloney. When the canal banks were public thoroughfares everybody used <Col N="584" /> them, people on horseback, on asses and on foot. Anglers had no problem with horse riding, although we never had a great tradition of fishing the canals. Pedestrians had no problem with it either. I never heard anything to suggest a problem with horses bolting because they saw pedestrians, although they sometimes do that.</P>
    <P>I probably should not say this because I was probably committing an offence but on one occasion I brought a hammer with me when I went for a ride along the canal. I used it to knock out some nails and to replace them and the barrier when I returned. Then the Office of Public Works scuppered me by installing metal barriers. However, whoever put up the barrier did not know anything about horses. He put it just at the right height to make it a grand fence to pop on one's way for a gallop down the canal bank. That went on for about six months until the barrier was raised again and made too high to jump. Obviously, it was one's intention to avoid going into the water.</P>
    <P>Now that we have Waterways Ireland and an admixture into the administration of our waterways of a bit of good, hard headed Northern Ireland common sense, I hope there will be a change in this. Someone who had a riding establishment near Mullingar decided to offer his clients who liked to go for a bit of hacking, a ride along the banks of the canal. However, the Office of Public Works decided the horses were cutting up the bank too much, took him to court and sought an injunction. It succeeded in obtaining an injunction from the courts to the effect that because the Office of Public Works did not want horses along the banks of the canal &ndash; it was the Office of Public Works's canal &ndash; that person should not be allowed to bring horse riders along that bank. Having obtained that injunction, the Office of Public Works decided the precedent was set and there would not be riding of horses along the banks of the canal, which is nonsensical. This is cutting off unnecessarily a very healthy, pleasant and scenic activity from a great number of people. My point is that it made its case on the basis that the banks of the canals were similar in law to the platforms of railway stations. God help us, the court accepted the banks of a canal can be held to be similar to the platforms of railways stations and that while there may be public access there is no public right of way.</P>
    <P>This is the type of decision which interferes with public rights of way and with the enjoyment of these rights of way. It is just one example of an official view which is inimical to public rights of way. We should be conscious of this and, where possible, we should include in legislation a reaffirmation of the rights of ordinary people to walk around the countryside on public land. This is why I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment and hope the Minister will accept my amendment No. 81, which seeks to draw up a public register of rights of way as part of each development plan so that the matter is put beyond doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one or two points on these amendments which I support.</P>
      <P>In 1974 when I became a member of Galway Corporation and Galway County Council until I left both local authorities, I was involved in both committee work and the general discussions in preparation for the different development plans. When the second plan was being discussed, I was horrified to find that the original maps, which showed public rights of way, were no longer available to those who wanted to draw up the plan. I had proposed an appendix to the plan to list the public rights of way which were under some threat. We found that through bureaucratic error the people who were closing off these rights of way had not been challenged by a previous official in a local authority. The case was lost in court and a decision was made to abandon a whole raft of territory. With this policy of abandonment of the assertion of the public's right went the maps that showed these original and traditional rights of way. I am not talking in the abstract because for anyone interested in landscape, the right to roam or ecology, these maps were of great importance. For example, there were a series of interlocking lanes which went from Rusheen Bay to the Corrib, across Tonabruckey and past the end of the Ice Age ridge which stretches down to Galway from Connemara. The old maps show this lace work. These were very interesting to people interested in rural architecture and the history of stone. The way in which some of them were protected by different kinds of stone wall was in itself of interest. At present if one takes an area such as Dangan out to Tonabruckey, which overlooks Galway city, one will see the stone walls have been flattened. First of all a piece of barbed wire might appear, followed by a few bushes and a mass of concrete where someone has encroached or built across a right of way. It is an absolute outrage that these rights of way are not being protected.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any requirement in the plan or a register of rights of way, anyone seeking to use rights of way must almost represent themselves as some kind of crank, find others who use them and make the case for one's amenity usage or whatever. As a former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for heritage, I know rights of way are a vital part of heritage. I urge the Minister to accede to these amendments, for which he will be thanked. In my lifetime there has been a massive deterioration in the number of rights of way in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Dukes said, on reflection, I agree with him. I recall a similar case being made to me about horse riding on canal banks. There is a difference between a public right of way and a right of way under the administration of the Office of Public Works. The case was put to me in a rather partial way that part of the bank would be insecure to carry the weight of a horse. Sometimes horse riding would be in competition with pedestrian use. Equally there was no legal basis for saying that the bank of a <Col N="586" /> canal was to be used for pedestrian use only. The only way it would have been solved and towards which I was aiming as Minister was to set up a statutory waterways authority which would define the usage. This would make the banks safe. It would widen, protect and maintain the banks and define the appropriate uses. In one instance we reserved an area for fishing for handicapped people. This was very specific usage and the banks were made wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>These are interesting times and I would like to put this matter in both a general and European context. I was speaking at a conference in Europe last year and reflecting on information provided by others. It seems to me that there has been a general contraction in public space at the end of the last century and the beginning of the new one. Looking across Europe, this is not the century that provided the great public spaces, parks, the right to have access to the countryside and so on. In one area after another, particularly when people critically review urban renewal schemes, one will find the traditional laneways and accesses have been closed off and much of the urban renewal has been the privatisation of what was previously a public area. The right to sit in public without the capacity to be a consumer or to purchase is something that existed in the old concept of the European street and all its laneways. Anyone currently studying urbanism in Europe will say that this has now been massively constricted. Orderly and proper planning should now fall in favour of the public's right to access, recreation and, without doing damage to private property, the public's right to roam.</P>
    <P>People will be aware of rather dramatic examples. How will one explain to a child in the future that we are an island nation? When I went to school we all began by saying, &ldquo;Ireland is an island nation&rdquo;. There are many places where access to the coast has been cut off, which is an outrage. I have long believed in making an order, valid throughout the country, and would have done so if I had the time and power, to create access to the sea. I regard the placing of barriers where people traditionally went to the sea as outrageous. It is not exercising a private right but is seriously obstructing a public right.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I support the amendments. The danger of the section is that it would be constructed as if it were a situation <i>de novo</i>, that it would be applied minimally and that an entire series of other things would fall away in the absence of being mentioned. Much has already fallen away. I would welcome the Minister for the Environment and Local Government instructing all local authorities to seek to rediscover as many of the maps as are in existence. Even basic mapping has been allowed fall away, which is a very serious loss to the public.</P>
    <P>It is very sad that with the loss and obstruction of rights of way people are denied access to certain forms of cobbling and stone walls, of which there are many varieties including loose stone walling, and the accompanying vegetation. If <Col N="587" /> people came to Galway city I could show them examples of this appalling encroachment for which there is no justification. When I was growing up in County Clare I heard about a particular form of madness in certain parts of a parish where people would dig out ditches to push the wall before them to gain a foot. It is that kind of craziness which has obstructed a public good. I hope the Minister sees fit not to be legalistic about it in terms of saying he is only dealing with the present or the future, but seeks to try as much as possible to reach back and recover some of that which has been lost, though I hope not forever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendments would require planning authorities to include a mandatory objective to preserve and protect rights of way in the development plan or to include a list of rights of way in the development plan. Deputy Dukes has resubmitted his amendment providing for a fast track register of rights of way. As the Minister said on Committee Stage, the new powers for local authorities to protect rights of way in their development plan under section 14 are the best way forward. I do not propose to provide that they will have to protect all rights of way in their area because that would be impossible and impractical. Neither do I intend accepting amendment No. 81 in the name of Deputy Dukes as it would place too much of a burden on landowners to disprove a right of way existed. Local authorities are the best agency to decide where it is appropriate to give protection to amenity rights of way and the procedures set out in section 14 are the best mechanism to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities have power to preserve public rights of way for the good of the general public. Section 14 sets out new and simplified procedures to allow planning authorities to include specific rights of way in their development plans. In future, once included for the first time in a development plan, it will not be necessary to continue to notify owners, etc., as required under the provisions of the 1963 Act. However, there is a danger that Deputy Gilmore's amendments would require planning authorities to protect and maintain all rights of way, public or private, in their area. Even if restricted to public rights of way, this would be overly onerous on planning authorities both in preparing and implementing the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often difficult to know whether a public right of way actually exists. For this reason section 14, unique among the sections on the development plan, includes an appeal to the Circuit Court when a person objects to a right of way being included in a development plan. Where a dispute arises as to whether a right of way exists, this can only be resolved by the courts. Therefore, it is not practical or legally sound to require all rights of way to be listed in the development plan. <Col N="588" /> As drafted, the Bill contains a much more practical way to ensure that rights of landowners can be protected when rights of way are included in the plan, and I ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <P>In law, all public roads are public rights of way, and these would comprise the major part of any list of rights of way. There is no sense in including a list of existing roads in the development plan. The Deputies are clearly thinking about rights of way which are amenities and which cross private land. However, it is clearly more appropriate for local authorities to be able to decide which rights of way of this kind need protection.</P>
    <P>As an alternative, Deputy Dukes seeks to provide that once the Bill comes into force, local authorities must open a register of public rights of way, and any person could insert a right of way on it. A year before the review of the development plan, the authority would publicise the register of rights of way and it would be up to the owner or occupier of the land to challenge the inclusion of a right of way. No standard of proof is required of the nominator of a public right of way. The landowner with an alleged right of way going through his lands would have to go to the difficulty and expense of challenging it in court. A planning authority, before deciding to include a public right of way in a development plan, will prudently establish the <i>prima facie</i> existence of such a right of way.</P>
    <P>The procedure to protect and create rights of way has existed in the Planning Acts since 1963. The procedures have been improved in this Bill. The fact that rights of way were not protected under the 1963 Act has not affected the status of rights of way since that time. Nothing will change, except that it will be easier in future to protect rights of way in development plans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes's story very well illustrates the problem of identifying a public right of way. In Deputy Dukes's words, they were virtual public thoroughfares. However, canal banks were presumably being used with the implicit permission of the canal operators. Therefore, no public right may have existed in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Bill solves the problem raised by Deputy Higgins. If a development plan contains a provision identifying a public right of way, that right of way will automatically be contained in all subsequent development plans. This is a new provision. There is no further need to consult with landowners in respect of subsequent development plans.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to interfere with Deputy Dukes's equestrian pursuits. I have come up against such objections from time to time and I think a little more common sense should be used. Securing the public rights of way referred to by the Deputies into the future may require specialist legislation and could be very impractical and extremely difficult for a local authority to cope with in the context of a development plan. However, I take on board the sensitivities mentioned and would like to have the opportunity to <Col N="589" /> discuss with my colleagues the possibility of specialist legislation to deal with the intricacies of the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Minister's last statement, I would like to see that invitation being followed up. Having spoken about my equestrian pursuits, it seems to be an invitation to live horse and get grass. We can make such provision in this Bill.</P>
      <P>What the Minister said illustrates the point I was making about the mindset of public authorities in relation to these issues. Things required of public authorities are onerous and no consideration is given to the fact that things taken away from the public are equally onerous on the public. It is one of a number of reasons I regret that Deputy Michael Higgins was not Minister for longer and that he did not have time to change the mindset in this area of our administration. My story, as the Minister called it, had no purpose other than to illustrate the mindset which the Minister has so expertly set out and so accurately repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 14 which I am glad to see in the Bill. Deputy Gilmore and I do not have a difficulty with it, the problem is that it just does not go far enough. If we are to have rights of way let us have a register. For the Minister to say that nothing will change and that rights of way are being protected is beside the point. While notionally they are protected by legislation, as Deputy Higgins indicated, they are being lost and obstructed, by a process of omission rather than anything else in public authorities. I am not happy that the provisions of this and other legislation dealing with the problem and with the proposition that we should await <Col N="590" /> separate legislation when in this Bill the necessary provisions can be written in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dukes, I am very disappointed at the Minister's response to the amendments, although I take a slight grain of comfort from his off-script remarks that perhaps separate legislation should be considered for the protection of rights of way. This goes to show that he is convinced by the argument being made. It is not sufficient justification for rejecting the amendments to say that they would place an undue burden on local authorities. What they would primarily require them to do is maintain a list of rights of way. If the Minister is prepared to accept this I will not press the amendment which would place an obligation on local authorities to maintain and preserve rights of way, if that is the difference between us, because what is of most importance is that they are identified and recorded to eliminate any doubt about their status.</P>
      <P>Rights of way are falling like nine pins. Deputy Higgins gave a number of examples along which, interestingly, I used to walk. I know of a number in my constituency. There is a constant series of closures and disputes about whether they were rights of way. The only way to deal with the matter is to list them. This is the Bill in which to provide for this. Given the rate at which legislation is produced by the Department we could have to wait two to three years for separate legislation by which time many rights of way will have been lost, particularly when account is taken of the pace of development.</P>

    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House are well aware of the increases in house prices which are making things difficult for people who wish to enter the housing market at present. In particular, the problems are most acutely felt by those who are trying to purchase their first home. The Government has already taken a series of actions which were designed to increase housing supply, dampen investor demand and thereby moderate house price increases. While these measures are having positive effects, the Government is now proposing a range of further initiatives to deal <Col N="608" /> with continued rising demand for houses for owner-occupiers in particular.</P>
    <P>The Government has considered the results of a further study commissioned by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, and undertaken by Peter Bacon and Associates, Economic Consultants. This study reviews and evaluates the effects of measures taken by the Government, in particular, under &ldquo;Action in the Housing Market&rdquo; in April <Col N="609" /> 1998 and &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; in March 1999. It also reviews other recent developments regarding housing demand, housing supply and house prices as well as providing a general review of the market since the publication of previous studies by the same consultancy firm. The consultants have concluded that considerable progress has been made in increasing housing output and in moderating the rate of price increase in new and existing houses, and that this has been achieved against a background in which housing demand has grown even more rapidly than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>It is clear from their analysis that the supply-demand imbalance in the housing market and the resultant increase in prices is fuelling demand further and leading to market instability as demand is brought forward to avoid anticipated future price increases and as investors seek to take advantage of capital appreciation. Recent moderation in overall house price trends masks a number of developments, in particular the fact that prices at the lower end of the housing market are now rising more rapidly than those at the upper end of the market.</P>
    <P>The consultants' recommendations to bring stability to the housing market focus on measures to expedite the supply response to meet rising demand and on certain targeted demand reduction measures to curb speculative and brought forward demand in the short-term. The Government is now proposing a comprehensive package of measures to maximise housing output to meet the continuing strong demand for housing, to curb short-term speculative demand, to strengthen the position of first time purchasers in the market, to increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet rising housing needs and to improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded that house price increases since the revision of stamp duty rates in 1998 have resulted in an increase in the burden of stamp duty, making it again a potential barrier to first time buyers entering the existing house market. This is significant because first time buyer housing needs are now being met increasingly from the existing house market. The analysis of the housing market carried out by the consultants suggested that there is a significant element of speculative or transitory demand which hampers efforts to meet fundamental demand with increased supply. The consultants therefore considered it appropriate that measures should be introduced to dampen this element of demand.</P>
    <P>They considered changes in stamp duties are one appropriate means to achieve this. The Government endorses these conclusions and has now decided to revise the existing stamp duty structure for second hand residential properties bought by owner-occupiers and for all residential properties bought by investors in order to bene<Col N="610" /> fitowner-occupiers and, in particular, those owner-occupiers who are first time buyers.</P>
    <P>The consultants also recommended the introduction of an annual tax of 2% to 3% of the value of properties which are not principal private residences as another measure to deal with demand. In view of evidence of increased speculative demand, the Government has decided to introduce an annual tax of 2% which will apply for three years to certain residential properties other than principal private residences.</P>
    <P>Exemptions will be provided in respect of qualifying residential investments under section 23, the town, rural and urban renewal schemes, section 50, which is student accommodation, the proposed living over the shop scheme and rented residential properties under the seaside resorts and the park and ride scheme. Exemptions will also be provided in respect of heritage homes and registered holiday homes. The tax will not apply to inheritance or to gifts of residential property where the property was acquired by the donor before 15 June 2000.</P>
    <P>Exemptions will also be available for landlords who comply with the standards and requirements of a proposed new regime for the private rented sector to be determined, following consideration of the forthcoming report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. In the meantime, exemptions will be provided for landlords who comply with the registration, rentbooks and standards regulations provided for under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty measure is the subject of the financial resolution now being moved. I will be publishing a Finance Bill next week which I hope will be debated here in Dáil Éireann the week after next. The Bill will encompass the changes to the stamp duty regime as well as the anti-speculative annual 2% tax which will apply for three years to certain residential properties other than a principal private residence.</P>
    <P>It is important to give assurance to those who are in the process of buying a home that the stamp duty changes are brought in with immediate effect from the time the Government announces its initiatives. On stamp duty, we propose to introduce a three tiered structure which will apply to first time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first time buyers and investors. The exemption threshold for first time buyers is being raised from £60,000 to £150,000 and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000. Rates for first time buyers at values up to £300,000 will now be 25% less than for other owner-occupiers. It is proposed to charge a flat 9% for all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property.</P>
    <P>The rates proposed for owner-occupiers and first time buyers are in line with the recommendations made by the consultants. In the case of investors, the consultants recommended no exemption threshold and rates 25% higher than the standard owner-occupier rate. The Government was very conscious of the continued price <Col N="611" /> increases at the lower end of the market and the importance of ensuring that families on modest resources are not put in a position of being priced out of the market by competition from investors. It is considered that a graduated scale of tax for investors might not sufficiently discourage speculative investment in the lower end of the market to the detriment of owner-occupiers and first time purchasers. Having considered the issues involved, the Government has decided that a rate of 9% should apply to all purchases by investors of new and second hand residential property irrespective of value.</P>
    <P>The proposed rates of stamp duty for housing are residential property purchased by first time buyers up to £150,000 will be exempt; for other owner-occupiers properties up to £100,000 will be exempt; owner-occupiers who are not first time buyers will be liable at 3% for properties in excess of £100,000 and up to £150,000; in the case of properties in excess of £150,000 and up to £200,000, first time buyers will be liable at 3% and other owner-occupiers at 4%; in the case of residential properties in excess of £200,000 and up to £250,000, first time buyers will be liable at 3.75% and other owner-occupiers at 5%; in the case of residential properties in excess of £250,000 and up to £300,000, first time buyers will be liable at 4.5% and other owner-occupiers at 6%; in the case of residential properties valued in excess of £300,000 and up to £500,000, first time buyers and other owner-occupiers will all be liable at 7.5% and other residential properties valued in excess of £500,000 are liable at 9%.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements will apply up to 31 January 2001 similar to those applying when the previous stamp duty changes were made in 1998. This means that pipeline cases will be allowed to avail of existing rates where written contracts were entered into prior to today and provided the conveyance takes place before 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these changes is estimated at £5 million this year and £10 million in a full year with the additional cost of the reductions for first time buyers and owner-occupiers being partially offset by higher rates for investors. I am confident these revised stamp duty rates will help reduce the cost burden faced by low to middle-income home buyers and widen their options. They will provide a particular advantage to first-time buyers who face difficulties in the current market.</P>

      <P>The housing market is out of control and has been for some time. Since the Government came into office, house prices have increased enormously, and we have now reached the stage where young couples in what are considered to be good jobs can no longer afford to buy a home of their own. The problem is particularly acute in Dublin, and persons such as nurses, teachers and gardaí are reluctant to work in Dublin because they cannot afford a house and, when they settle down, they are faced with a long commute from midland towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> This financial resolution arises from the third Bacon report. Since it is the third report and because the previous two Bacon initiatives failed, the Government is on very weak ground. Dr. Bacon's prescriptions failed in the past, and this third attempt to cure the ills of the housing market will also fail. This is not entirely Dr. Bacon's fault. It is principally the fault of the Government and, in particular, the fault of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who has consistently failed to understand the fundamental analysis of the Bacon reports and take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The national housing crisis has arisen from a mismatch between supply and demand. For a variety of reasons demand is rising and will continue to rise, so the only initiatives which will bring the market into equilibrium are initiatives which will increase the supply of houses. The proposals move in the opposite direction. The Government has now turned full circle in policy terms and its principal proposals will reduce the demand for houses rather than increase the supply.</P>
    <P>The principal culprit is the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. He has failed to implement the Bacon recommendations to increase the supply of houses. He has failed to mobilise his Department and local authorities to ensure there is a sufficient supply of serviced zoned building land. He has failed to reorganise the planning departments in local authorities or reorganise An Bord Pleanála to ensure major delays in planning do not continue to inhibit house building. He has failed to reconcile local authority practice with national policy. The Government is committed to increasing the supply of houses, yet everyone in the House knows, especially those who are local authority members, that every local authority in the country has moved in the opposite direction and will not even consider planning applications for sites where, until recently, people were free to build. The Minister has failed to introduce an adequate public housing programme to meet the long waiting lists in every local authority.</P>
    <P>After presiding over a chaotic housing market for three years, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will shortly face the wrath of the people. In a last throw of the gambler's dice, he has decided to reduce demand for houses rather than to increase supply by chasing investors out of the housing market. Dr. Bacon estimates that the supply of houses is about 10,000 units per annum short of demand. The Government's proposal to impose stamp duty at 9% on all newly acquired rental residential accommodation, together with the proposal of an annual property tax at 2% on such accommodation, will chase investors out of the market. This will lead to a temporary increase in the supply of houses for purchase by owner-occupiers.</P>
    <P>However, as it always does, the market will quickly adjust. The building industry will find a new equilibrium and the number of houses being built will drop significantly. Cash demand will be <Col N="613" /> reduced, but the real demand based on the need for houses, which, according to Dr. Bacon, is about 55,000 units per annum, will not be reduced. In the medium-term, we will reap the whirlwind of this misguided policy as the number of houses being built will reduce significantly from the current 45,000. The gap between supply and real demand will widen as a result of these proposals and, in the medium-term, because of the widening of that gap, prices will be driven up. Today's misguided initiatives will make a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>These penal taxes will also ensure that no new rental accommodation will become available in the foreseeable future. The supply of rental accommodation will remain static, demand will continue to rise and rents will jump. The rental market in Dublin is already chaotic. I would hate to be a returning emigrant, a student or a person on a local authority housing list looking for rented accommodation in Dublin next autumn.</P>
    <P>The Government should learn from its mistakes. When it implemented the previous Bacon recommendations to abolish tax relief on interest on mortgages on rental accommodation, two things happened. The investors temporarily moved out of the market, and for six months it was extremely difficult to get any rental accommodation in Dublin. Then rents jumped and the investors came back in. The policy had no impact on the price of houses; it just made rental accommodation extremely expensive. Arising from this experience, what does the Government expect will happen in the rental market when these penal taxes drive out every investor? The new property tax will, according to the Government, apply for at least three years. Where will young single people and students live? Where will the young emigrants live who are being induced by the Government to return to Ireland? There is no consistency in Government policy, and the very initiatives it has taken to increase the supply of labour are now being negatived by the asinine policy being pursued for the rental sector. It is also worth noting that Dr. Bacon proposed that the stamp duty on rental accommodation would be imposed at 3.75%. Some genius in Government has decided that, if the initiative is effective at 3.75%, it will be brilliant at 9%, especially when a 2% annual property tax is added. Has anyone around the Cabinet table any idea of how the housing market works and how it is a seamless market between the owner-occupied side and the rental side?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers of second hand homes. The Minister must feel somewhat embarrassed in proposing this measure. When Fine Gael proposed a similar measure on a number of occasions in 1998, he argued strongly against it and, when it was put to a vote, the combined forces of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil voted against the proposal. The record of the House will show that the Minister for Finance believes reductions in stamp duty along the lines of his <Col N="614" /> proposal will lead to an increase in house prices as the savings in stamp duty will enable the purchaser to pay more. These are the Minister's arguments and they are on the record of the House. We had at least three debates on it. The Minister does not believe in what he is doing.  </P>
    <P>The Government has failed to resolve the housing crisis. Its tampering in the market has exacerbated the problem, yet it continues to meddle while refusing to take the measures which would increase the supply of houses. This is a disastrous Government whose failures over three years were hidden by the booming economy but which is now being exposed in all its nakedness clutching a handful of threadbare, moth-eaten and failed initiatives.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) of the proposed new section 92B, to delete &ldquo;£150,000&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute &ldquo;£200,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That this debate is happening at this time and in these circumstances is little short of a disgrace. I was contacted yesterday evening and told the Government wanted to take these resolutions this morning. I was given the resolutions in confidence by the official who contacted me and that is fair enough. I asked for a copy of the report and was told I could not have it because it did not belong to the Department of Finance but to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. An approach seeking the report was made to that Department and was refused. The position which Deputy Noonan and myself are in is that we received a copy of the report one hour ago and were obliged to analyse and debate it in that short period, something which cannot be done properly. It is all the more outrageous when Dr. Bacon has been briefing journalists since 9 o'clock this morning. It is normal for the Opposition to complain about the Government treating the Dáil with contempt, but this takes the biscuit.</P>
      <P>Beyond the contempt and discourtesy is a genuine and disturbing reality. The Government has effectively abdicated all responsibility for housing policy to Dr. Peter Bacon and his associates. I do not blame Dr. Bacon for that. It is a good and, no doubt, well paid job or well paid work if one can get it but I blame the Minister and, in particular, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bacon has served the Government well. His reports have prodded the Minister into doing some things which were certainly positive or would have been positive if they had been done properly and on time. More than that, the Minister has used Dr. Bacon's report as a shield to hide the fact that the Government is completely devoid of policy. Worse than that, the Minister has used Dr. Bacon's reports to fend off any policy proposals which had not received the<i> imprimatur </i>of Dr. Bacon. All the proposals before us fall into that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Two years ago I proposed that first time buyers should not have to pay stamp duty irrespective of the type of house they were buying. The logic was and is very simple. The traditional exemption from stamp duty for new houses only was intended first and foremost as a stimulus to the construction industry. It was intended to encourage first time buyers to buy new rather than second hand houses thereby creating greater demand for new houses, greater employment opportunities and so on. It has, however, been clear for quite some time that the construction industry does not need any stimulus of this kind &ndash; quite the contrary. There is a serious surplus of demand which the industry has been unable to meet. Equally, it has been clear for quite some time that first time buyers are the people who have suffered most in the current crisis.</P>
    <P>My constituency illustrates this problem better than most. I represent what I suppose would be called a settled part of Dublin. It includes some old corporation estates in places like Donnycarney and Artane, a fierce wave of houses built on institutional land in the 1970s and, I suppose, the fairly affluent area of Clontarf. The bald fact is that it is no longer possible for any young person on average earnings growing up in my constituency to buy a house in the area in which he or she was brought up. It is scarcely possible for any young person or young couple in my constituency to buy a house in the constituency. Marino, for example, is a very desirable place to live but it is no longer possible to get a house there for less than £200,000 and when that happens, it is time to say loudly and clearly that this cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the local authority schemes, such as the shared ownership scheme, are effectively inoperative because the maximum threshold would not permit the purchase of any house in the constituency. If our policy aim is to help first time buyers rather than the construction industry, then it makes no sense to impose stamp duty on the purchase of second hand houses by first time buyers. As I said earlier, I first proposed this when we debated the Finance No. 2 Bill two years ago. I proposed it again on the Finance Bill, 1999, and as recently as a few months ago when we debated the Finance Bill, 2000. On each of those occasions I failed to elicit a half decent response from the Minister. In so far as he said anything about it, he appeared to be opposed to the proposal. Needless to say, I am happy the Minister has come around to that view now but I find it truly amazing that he had to wait for a prompt from Dr. Bacon to do so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will support these measures because we agree with the measures in themselves. We do not believe they constitute an adequate or complete response to the housing crisis &ndash; far from it. It is important to recognise the limitations of what we are doing this afternoon. In essence, this resolution is an admission of defeat. In proposing it, the Government is <Col N="616" /> acknowledging that there are not enough houses to go around and that there are insufficient houses to meet the existing demand.</P>
    <P>What we are doing this afternoon is seeking to confer a comparative advantage on first time buyers. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that in order to do that in current circumstances we have to take measures which may well have the effect of discouraging investment in the private rental sector. The Government proposes a 9% rate of stamp duty on all investment property where the contract is signed after today. I support that measure but without any real enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The country, let us be clear, needs a vibrant private rental sector. We all accept there is an insufficient number of units available for rent. The standard of some of the accommodation which is available is utterly unacceptable at the start of the 21st century. Many landlords are charging high rents and providing substandard accommodation and they still seem to believe they are entitled to raise their rent or eject their tenants at little or no notice. Our legislation, as my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, said yesterday, is in urgent need of reform. The existing regulations must be enforced and we have to bring more units on stream.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that the 9% rate will discourage investors. It will hit people who are seeking to buy second homes or holiday homes and people who want to make a quick buck, and perhaps there is no harm in that. However, it will also hit people who are in the long-term business of letting property. This is, to say the least, unfortunate but it is an inevitable consequence of what we are doing today. Had the Government acted sooner and intervened earlier to ensure an adequate supply of houses, we would not have to make this choice. However, we are faced with the choice and make it we must. If we are serious about helping first time buyers &ndash; we, in the Labour Party, are &ndash; in the context of limited supply, we must also take action to discourage investors.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that this position is not sustainable in the long-term and perhaps not even in the medium term. We need to look at this as a short-term skewing of demand borne out of crisis circumstances rather than something that is desirable in itself.</P>
    <P>The Government proposal provides that second-hand houses should be exempt from stamp duty for first time buyers up to a limit of £150,000. The sad reality is that there are many first time buyers who will be obliged to spend more than £150,000 on their first house, whether second-hand or new. The amendment in my name proposes that we should extend that exemption from £150,000 to £200,000. I mentioned earlier the former corporation estate of Marino. One cannot get a house for under £200,000 in that estate. Any first time buyers seeking to buy into that estate are required, unfortunately, to pay more than the £150,000 which is provided for in the resolution. Unfortunately, the £150,000 is not enough. There would be a stimulus in increasing <Col N="617" /> it beyond £150,000 and it is something we have to do if we are willing to grasp the nettle of assisting first time buyers, and that is the purpose of the amendment in my name.</P>
    <P>I also tabled an amendment which provides that in the event the Government does not accept that, it might apply the new rates of stamp duty for first time buyers of second-hand houses only on the excess amount in excess of £150,000 so that somebody buying a house for £200,000, for example, would pay stamp duty at 3% on the £50,000 excess rather than on the full £200,000. The thrust of both amendments is an attempt to further assist first time buyers of second-hand houses.</P>
    <P>The resolution before us also reduces the rates and changes the thresholds for people trading up. This is a logical and reasonable thing to do but I do not seriously believe it will have a significant effect on the market. I have argued for some time that we should index link the rates and, in particular, thresholds. It would make more sense to index it to the rate of increase in house price inflation. We should not look at stamp duty as simply a cash cow for Government and it is fair and reasonable that it should be index linked as the price of houses increases. Effectively, what Dr. Bacon suggested and what the Government is doing today does precisely that.</P>
    <P>The measures before us this morning are only one side of the equation. The House debated a comprehensive Labour Party motion earlier this week which set out our approach, most particularly, on the supply side. I do not have the opportunity now to go into these issues but I will do so during the debate on the Finance Bill the week after next. We will support these measures today. They should have been taken years ago and would have been more effective if they had been. Make no mistake about this, taken in isolation, these measures will not work. They must be accompanied by measures to counter speculation and profiteering and, so far, this Government has been very slow to do that.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed the very many young people who hold the simple ambition to own their own house and who cannot now realise that ambition. I have little faith the Government will get this right in the dying days of the Administration but, in so far as these specific stamp duty measures are concerned, we will do the right thing and support them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to recommission Dr. Bacon to examine this question and the resolution that is before us, the detail of which will have to be fleshed out in legislative form in the Finance Bill. I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the issue raised by Deputy McDowell of having some form of taper<Col N="618" /> ing stamp duty relief for those who purchase houses in excess of £150,000. To my knowledge in the greater Dublin area, and no doubt in other areas, the firsttime buyer's house costs in excess of that figure.</P>
      <P>Since my election, I have advocated that an exemption for the first &ndash; time buyer should be built into the stamp duty code. I welcome the fact that the Government has taken that decision and will implement that basic principle as a cornerstone of stamp duty legislation.</P>
      <P>We can debate our responsibilities on this matter on all sides of the House but when we are discussing the wider question of how we tackle the problem of over-priced housing and the shortage of supply, we cannot evade them at local and national level. I listened to Deputy McDowell castigate this Government. Will the Labour Party intervene with their representatives at local level and instruct them to stop blocking developments and pandering to local interests where vital development must take place?</P>
      <P>Supply and demand of serviced land enters the equation. I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided to introduce another measure I have advocated for some time, namely some form of unused site value tax on developers who do not develop lands designated for housing development. That is the most significant feature of what was announced this morning. The power of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to designate strategic development zones for housing will be exercised under the new planning legislation and a levy on non-development of land within those strategic development zones will be introduced. Clearly that is moving the whole focus of planning for housing away from local authorities and towards central direction. That has had to happen because of misguided policies in certain local authorities regarding the development of land and the inability to strategically plan for development in the greater Dublin area. It is a significant decision that was announced a few moments ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome the revised stamp duty regime. I notice there is an element of transitional relief for those who have already entered into accrued transactions and that is dated from today. Clearly the contract must have been signed by yesterday and the transfer must be executed by the end of the year. I would like to see that clarified in legislative form. No doubt when the Finance Bill comes before the House we will have an opportunity to examine that aspect because individuals will have entered into commitments prior to the enactment of this measure and they may be prejudiced by it. Their position should be safeguarded. A fair point can be made on the cost of new housing that some form of tapering relief could be introduced above £150,000.</P>

      <P>I welcome the proposed stamp duty changes introduced by the Minister for Finance. Like Deputy Noonan I hope they will not be added on to the price of a house as happened <Col N="619" /> in the past when similar changes were made. We must be wary of that. I am disappointed we received the document from the Department of the Environment and Local Government late in the day and did not have much time to analyse it. However, the measures do not address the issue of supply as mentioned by previous speakers. The Minister will agree that the problem is that there are insufficient new houses to ensure a viable and competitive market. There is not enough developed land. For example, in Dublin 7,000 acres of land are zoned for housing and other purposes. That includes industrial land. Some 2,500 acres of serviced land is available for house building. When you take that in the context of the demand that exists we have a major problem. These proposals and the efforts made by the Minister in the past will not be sufficient to meet that.</P>
      <P>Unless area action plans are in place, those who apply for planning are told their applications are premature. They are put on ice until such time as there are action plans. The planning department does not have the necessary staffing to draw up these plans. That is a major difficulty.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of 1,000 extra local authority houses per year. Last year we built 3,000 local authority houses. In the mid-eighties the Government was providing more than 5,000 houses. There is a commitment in the national development plan for 5,500 houses per year over the next six years and now we have this additional commitment. When one considers that there are 40,000 people on local authority waiting lists it would take seven years to clear that list. I understand about 10% of these people, 4,000 applicants, have an average wage. They will not be able to buy or build a private sector house as they will not get the required mortgage. There is not any provision in these measures for affordable housing that would help such people. We are not taking into consideration the number of those who will be on the local authority housing applicants' list over the next five years. That will be probably 50,000 people, especially with the prevalence of single parent families and so on. They will find it very difficult to buy their own houses.</P>
      <P>Private public partnerships were not mentioned in the document &ldquo;Action on Housing&rdquo; that we received from the Department. Under a PPP, Fingal County Council built 800 houses. Six hundred of them went to local authority tenants and 200 to the private sector. This could be replicated throughout the country. Eight hundred houses were provided rapidly. Will the Minister clarify the situation regarding properties costing between £150,000 and £200,000? If people pay more than £150,000 they will pay the full 3% stamp duty on the total price of the house so there is a need for a tapering measure to change this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bacon recommendations are very much geared towards the Dublin market and, perhaps, to centres such as Galway and Cork. There is a <Col N="620" /> different type of problem in rural Ireland. The restrictions being imposed on investments should not apply to areas outside Dublin as the Bacon recommendations generally do not apply to many parts of the country. The Minister is aware there are different problems in these areas concerning the provision of services and other issues which restrict the market. However, we will have more time to dwell on these issues later.</P>

      <P>I will comment on this and other measures the Government proposes to take in the area of housing. There is no doubt we have been trying to deal with housing and I would be the first to admit I am primarily concerned with how it impacts on the Dublin area. There has been a logjam, a fair amount of rezoned land but not enough serviced land. I am glad these initiatives will fast-track that process.</P>
      <P>I welcome the idea of strategic development zones which will have an impact, provided local authorities get rid of some of the inertia with which they are burdened. At the risk of boring Deputies, Dublin Corporation designated two sites for affordable housing three years ago but not a sod has been turned. That is an unacceptable situation when people are looking to buy houses.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure concerning stamp duty which I have sought for a long time. This measure will have an impact on people in constituencies such as mine. There are parts of that constituency in which this measure will not have a significant impact but it will allow couples or individuals to buy a modest second-hand house as their first home. That is to be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is increasing the income eligibility limit for shared ownership schemes from £20,000 to £25,000. I have been seeking such a change for a long time. Two constituents of mine, one of whom is a junior university lecturer whose wife works in administration, will be able to buy a second-hand home in the area of their choice in my constituency and I welcome that fact.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the additional 1,000 houses. Some schemes are taking effect. In one such scheme on the fringe of my constituency, Fingal County Council and a private developer have come to an agreement whereby the 20% social housing initiative will begin immediately, resulting in a significant number of social housing units. I welcome these measures which will have a significant impact on house buyers.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister and all concerned with this report. There are two worth<Col N="621" /> while aspects to the report as it includes recommendations and policy responses which go further than many people would have predicted some months ago. I welcome the changes to stamp duty for first time buyers but a tapering rate should apply beyond £150,000 as, certainly in my constituency, few second-hand properties sell for less than that figure.</P>
      <P>I will comment on the demand side measures in general. In addition to the specifics on stamp duty I particularly welcome the anti-speculation measures. It is astonishing that it has recently become obvious in the greater Dublin area that people are buying multiple houses because they realise there is a significant capital investment to be made. The anti-speculation tax measures may be transitory but they are welcome.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the extension of income limits for shared ownership schemes but question whether £25,000 is a level which will allow one to buy a house in the greater Dublin area. However, in conjunction with measures on affordable housing and the 1,000 additional housing starts, this initiative is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>As regards the strategic development zones, I agree there has been a problem, there is a logjam and rezoned land has not been coming on stream. The variety of measures being introduced, together with capital injections, will greatly help to speed up the market. I compliment the Minister. There are difficulties but when considering the legislation I would ask him to examine the tapering measures I suggested.</P>

      <P>The Government was wrong to re-appoint Dr. Bacon to examine the housing market given that his recommendations were part of the first and second Bacon reports. The process undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government which awarded the contract to Dr. Bacon was flawed. There was not a tendering process and that is in conflict with the public procurement document submitted by the Department of Finance to other Departments. No other economic consultant was asked to tender for this work and I want to know why. Given that the first two Bacon reports have not solved the crisis it seems ludicrous to ask the same person to again consider the changes which have occurred over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government has performed a somersault and accepted Fine Gael's position that stamp duty should not apply to first time buyers buying second-hand houses. However, the resolution's niggardly proposal of a maximum of £150,000 will do little for first time buyers. Once the price is more than £150,000 the full stamp duty will apply to first time buyers. If anything, this measure will further increase prices in the Dublin market where very few houses sell for £150,000 or less. The vast majority of houses, particularly second-hand houses, sell for much higher than £150,000 and there is no evidence <Col N="622" /> that this measure will result in a reduction or stabilisation in house prices.</P>
    <P>This morning an auctioneer told a first time buyer who wishes to buy a second-hand house to bid an additional £5,000 as a result of the changes to be implemented. As a result of bidding, this will mean the price of the house will rise by £5,000 or more. Where are we going?</P>
    <P>Will the additional 2% tax charges on investors in the private rented sector apply to existing dwellings or will it be a new charge? Less that 10% of landlords are registered with local authorities and the Minister hopes to induce them by exempting them from this 2% charge. However, he has not had much success to date, nor has the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Less than 10% of landlords are registered with local authorities and they are flouting the law passed by this House. This law is not being applied because the vast majority of people are in the black economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan rightly stated that tax changes concerning investors will further squeeze the market and tenants will have to pick up the 2% charge and the 9% stamp duty. These charges will be passed on to tenants so the measure will not make a material difference.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to prove that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, should consider their positions. They have been in charge of this matter for the past three years during which time the position has deteriorated. House prices and rents have doubled and there are now 120,000 people on the local authority housing list. As Deputy Carey said, this is about the Government taking responsibility. We have witnessed a deterioration in the housing market, particularly in Dublin. Density proposals and the serviced land initiative have not been enforced, yet the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing blame everyone but themselves. They say it is the responsibility of the local authorities and the regional authorities. The buck must stop here. Ultimately, the Government should take responsibility for this matter.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in this resolution will do nothing to assist first time buyers. This is not a systematic comprehensive package of measures to provide for first time buyers. If anything, it will further bid up prices. As many commentators have said, this crisis in the housing market is the real Achilles heel of the Government and, ultimately, it will bring down the Government.</P>

      <P>That is understood.</P>
      <P>Speaking in this House last night, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, poured scorn on the idea that we need control and regulation in housing. Deputy Lenihan told us the market will provide that. Yet today we are presented with measures that completely contradict those assertions. By presenting them, the Government acknowledges that it must control and regulate the housing market.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure on stamp duty, as far as it goes. I also welcome the tax, limited though it is, on investors buying residential properties for non-owner occupation. To present these measures as the solution to the housing crisis is a travesty. It has taken three years for the Government to come up with these proposals. Quite simply, it is too little too late.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, told us there have been moderating house price trends since house price inflation peaked in 1998. Yet we know the reality is that house prices have risen by more than 70% since the Government took office. The gross inequality in our society is seen as multi-millionaires compete at the top end of the market for so-called prestige properties while people on average incomes are crippled with huge mortgages, cannot afford a mortgage or, if they qualify, join the ever growing local authority waiting list.</P>
      <P>Those on low incomes are in dire housing need. There is little or nothing for them in these measures. Local authorities should lead the attack on the housing crisis. It must be taken on board in a straightforward manner that the provision of an extra 1,000 local authority housing units for the next six years is simply not enough.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta O Caoláin as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Although the Minister claims this measure will help owner occupiers, it is not significant, but I would like to be proven wrong because the housing crisis is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>The Green Party proposed the taxing of second homes some years ago when it published a housing policy; it is disappointing it has taken so long to bring this about. The links between Fianna Fáil and the developers about which we have heard in the media may explain why such a policy has been introduced very reluctantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have yet to see a proper windfall tax on land zoned for residential development, which will also be critical to tackling this issue. The Planning Institute tell us there is plenty of rezoned land if it could be used. If these measures were introduced, they would hit the benefactors <Col N="624" /> of the two largest parties in their fundraising drives, but I hope that will not prevent their introduction.</P>
    <P>If a 2% tax were imposed on second homes for three years, how would that prevent landlords increasing rents to offset the cost of the tax? The rental sector would suffer from such a measure. How will the proposed reduction in stamp duty prevent the price of houses remaining as high as the forces of supply and demand dictate? </P>
    <P>We had a debate in this House on ticket touts and cracking down on their <i>modus operandi,</i> as they pitched their price at whatever they could get. If a ticket tout's <i>modus operandi</i> is so offensive, why is profiteering in housing not all the more offensive?</P>
    <P>We often hear that the protection afforded to property owners under the Constitution prevents us from doing much about this. If the Constitution prevents us from introducing measures to serve the common good, will the Minister propose a referendum on the matter so we can deal with the housing crisis in a comprehensive way?</P>
    <P>It is vital that essential services are provided in a co-ordinated manner for the homeless. The demand for such services increased by 40% last year. As well as local authority and social housing, student accommodation is also needed. It should be provided by the State. Other countries have plenty of student accommodation provided by the State, yet we are reluctant to do so.</P>
    <P>Rent controls will have to be introduced. The position in the rental sector would put to shame the worst practices of rack-renting and absentee landlords in pre-Famine Ireland. The position is as bad today for many tenants in that sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be possible to deal with all the issues raised by the Deputies in the few minutes I have to contribute, but a Finance Bill dealing with the stamp duty regulations and the other matter to which I referred will be introduced, at which time this whole issue can be debated further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan stated that the Government had not addressed the supply side. The Bacon report makes it clear that the rates of increase incurred in the past two years have been equal to or greater in magnitude than the predictions made two years ago on the level of supply that would be required to achieve stability in the housing market. The level of completions is the highest recorded in one year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the effect of the anti-speculative tax on rental accommodation, and Deputy Sargent also referred to that matter. Deputies will note from my speech and the response from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that if a person becomes a registered landlord and complies with the new rules and regulations, the 2% anti-speculative tax will not apply. That will be covered in more detail in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also referred to student accommodation. A special relief for the provision <Col N="625" /> of rented accommodation for students was introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. This has already resulted in the provision of up to date and specially designed accommodation and more such projects will come on stream in the next 12 months. Student accommodation is also exempt from the 2% anti-speculative tax. We can debate that further during the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies McDowell, Brian Lenihan, Deenihan and Roche referred to the stamp duty regulations. Deputy McDowell suggested that if his amendment providing for a £200,000 provision was not accepted, the 3% rate should apply only to the balance between £150,000 and £200,000 and not to the entire consideration. More or less the same point was made by some of the other Deputies, that the rate should apply to a step provision, so to speak, and then to the level above that. The whole structure of stamp duty is based on a slap system rather than a step system. Once the threshold is exceeded, the rates apply to the entire consideration. This has always been the case with stamp duty. Any change to apply a rate to an excess amount only would require a complete restructuring of the stamp duty system. If such a step system were in place, I could envisage rates of 45% or 50% being introduced to collect the same amount of revenue. That is the reason such a step system has not been introduced in the various changes that have been made in the area of stamp duty.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report refers to the question of supply and it makes recommendations regarding stamp duty. I do not want to advise Deputy Hayes about debating points, but the debating point he made on foot of a conversation he had with an auctioneer this morning contradicts the point he made about making a change to the <Col N="626" /> stamp duty regime, in that, the auctioneer pointed out that such increases would be passed on and would simply bid up the supply. If the Deputy read my contribution on this matter over a period, he would see I made similar points, but Dr. Bacon recommends these changes. The Deputy should not make points which contradict what he said. I give that friendly word of advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much agreement in the Seanad and on Committee Stage about the need for the planning system to take into consideration the special needs of the Gaeltacht. My amendments on that Stage strengthened the references to the protection of the Gaeltacht in the development plan. As I explained on Committee Stage, they more than met the points in Deputy Gilmore's amendment in section 10. There is no further need for the amendment. The objective in section 10 deals with the point raised in the amendment to section 34. The planning authority has to make its decision on any application having regard to the provision of the development plans.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment to make the drawing up of regional planning guidelines a joint function of Údarás na Gaeltachta, I have explained that, given the development functions of Údarás na Gaeltachta, it is not suited to that role. I consider the existing provision in section 23(4)(<i>b</i>) to have regard to the need to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the amendment to Part V is not necessary as housing strategies in section 93 are incorporated in the development plan and will, therefore, be subject to the objective in section 10, as will the local authority policies regarding the allocation of houses under section 96. As Deputies know, a number of changes have been made since the Seanad debate and Committee Stage in this area. There is very broad agreement on what has been achieved. The Irish language <Col N="629" /> movement has already stated it is happy with the changes that have been introduced.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Gilmore's arguments on this point, I have brought forward my own amendment which is intended to cover this issue. I hope, therefore, that he will withdraw his amendment.

      <P>In page 34, line 41, to delete &ldquo;5 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;16 weeks&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the debate on Committee Stage on the adoption of the development plan, I promised to reconsider the various time periods for Report Stage. The series of amendments I have tabled reflect the outcome of that review. The one principle I am not prepared to relent on is the need to ensure the process is carried out within the two year timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first set of amendments to section 11 timetable more precisely the various functions which have to be carried out in the preparation of the draft development plan. The initial period for the information pre-consultation period is being reduced from 20 to 16 weeks. The time available for councillors to issue directions after receipt of the manager's report is now being expressly provided for &ndash; this is ten weeks. Following the issue of directions, the manager will have a further 12 weeks to prepare the draft. This then goes to the <Col N="630" /> members who have eight weeks to amend the draft if they wish. The reworking of section 11 means that the process of finalising the draft and getting it passed by the councillors will take place in ten and a half months. This leaves two weeks for the authority to prepare the plan for public display, following the making of amendments at that stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 12, additional time is being given to both the manager and the councillors to carry out their functions. There was always some leeway at the end of the process in year two for slippage, but this is being reduced by the changes. To achieve the additional time, the resolution of the members provided for in subsection (1) has now been incorporated into the process under section 11, as I explained. The public consultation procedure under section 3 is also shortened by two weeks to ten weeks. The manager is given an extra two weeks to prepare his report under subsection (5), that is, 12 weeks, and the members are given an extra four weeks to consider the results of the first phase of consultation under subsection (6). The period for preparing amendments and publishing notice of them on foot of the resolution under subsection (7) is also now timetabled at three weeks. Councillors are also given an extra two weeks to consider the report on the amendments to the development plan. The total timetable in section 12 is now 51 weeks, which allows for five weeks slippage in the process. The Bill, as passed by the Seanad, probably allowed for about ten weeks slippage, depending on how the non-timetabled processes were estimated. All processes are now timetabled. I consider these amendments to be fair to officials and elected members of the council, and that they meet the general concerns of the Opposition amendments.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there is an error in amendment No. 67. The amendment should read &ldquo;22&rdquo; and not &ldquo;24&rdquo;. This has been corrected in the fourth list of additional amendments.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 241, which discounts the Christmas period for most processes under the Bill, is consequential and ensures that no confusion arises, in relation to the adoption of the development plan, on whether nine days should be deducted for each year of the process.</P>
    <P>I have a draft of the preparation of the draft development plan which shows these changes in simplified form. I will arrange for it to be circulated to Deputies as soon as it is convenient to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for circulating the simplified version of the amendments. We had quite a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage about the periods of time which should be allowed for the various stages of making a development plan. I had two principal concerns. In the original Bill, a disproportionately large amount of time seemed to be given to the manager and his officials for the preparation of their reports and the various things they have to do, <Col N="631" /> with a much more limited time available to the elected members, whose job it is to make the actual decision. I was also concerned about the period of time allowed for public consideration and display.</P>
      <P>A number of these amendments extend the time periods for consideration by elected members and the public. I want to express two concerns in this regard. My first concern is about the proposal to reduce the period for the public display of the draft itself from 12 to ten weeks. I appreciate it is only a reduction of two weeks. Nevertheless, the display of the draft development plan is critical because it is the draft which signals the intentions of the council to the public. Most public comments and observations are probably made around the draft plan rather than the amendments, which are displayed at a later stage. I have some concern about that period being reduced from 12 to ten weeks.</P>
      <P>My second concern is a more general one. I appreciate the necessity to complete a development plan within a reasonable period of time. Two years are provided for consideration of the draft and its finalisation. Local authorities should be able to make the development plan within that period.</P>
      <P>However, I am a little concerned about the inflexibility being stitched into the process. Each stage will be time restricted. We might discover that individual local authorities, depending on their size and the complexity of the issues they must consider, might need more time for one stage and less for another. I do not know how that will be addressed.</P>
      <P>Can a local authority in its consideration of the development plan request the Minister to extend one of those periods while not seeking an extension of the total period for consideration of the plan? In other words, could a local authority ask to extend the period for the public display of the draft plan and propose that the period of time for consideration of the draft by the council be reduced, provided it all came within the total recommended number of weeks? Can that degree of flexibility be built in?</P>
      <P>Local authorities will probably run into some practical difficulties trying to meet a deadline at each stage. Practical matters can arise such as a planning officer being ill for a period, a key member of staff being away or industrial relations problems. Problems of that nature can disrupt the normal flow of procedures and a little flexibility might be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme the Minister has now circulated represents an improvement on the initial scheme. Like Deputy Gilmore, I am concerned about the amount of time available for making public submissions on the draft plan. I am equally if not more concerned about the amount of time members of the local authority have to consider the various items that come before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note, in relation to preparation of the plan, that members of local authorities have ten weeks <Col N="632" /> to consider the manager's report on the draft development plan and 12 weeks to generate recommendations. That is probably a reasonable period. When the draft development plan is being made, the elected members of the authority have 12 weeks to consider the draft plan and the manager's report and three weeks during which they can either accept or amend it. There are four weeks for the display of amendment.</P>
    <P>The total amount of time in the first phase is 46 weeks and 51 weeks in the second phase. In the period of two years, which is the basic framework set down in the Bill, 97 weeks are being used under the scheme set out by the Minister. Is it reasonable to deduce that in the two year framework for the preparation and adoption of a plan there is the possibility of seven weeks leeway which can be used at various stages during that process? Although we might quibble with individual bits of the scheme, if there are seven weeks of potential slippage time, it appears to be a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>My concern would always be about the amount of time for public consultation and for the elected members to consider what is before them. In the manner of all politicians, I am less concerned about the convenience of bureaucrats. That is the way we are built. I am sure the compliment is equally returned from the other side. If in a two year period there is elbow room of seven weeks, we have done as much as possible to make the process convenient for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The concept of fixing the duration of the development plan and requiring by statute that the preparation of the next development plan begins two years before the end of the current one is probably the best framework we can achieve. I wish I could say that the experience one gleans from drawing up development plans would lead one to the belief that having gone through the process once, it would be well on track after that. That, of course, is not the case. In our experience with development plans the old truism, that history teaches us how to make the same mistakes again, reasserts itself. Given the turnover in membership of local authorities, there is always a group of new members who are avid to remake the mistakes of their predecessors.</P>
    <P>We will never achieve perfection in legislation of this nature. Taking everything into account and given the cushion of seven weeks, the conclusion arrived at is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue which supports Deputy Dukes's comments on time limits for development plans. It is the new Part which the Minister has introduced on Report Stage. He is proposing radical changes whereby, under Part 15, development of the foreshore is permissible. This means, in the context of Dublin, that planning applications can be made to fill in Dublin Bay in whole or in part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is extremely controversial. The reason the Minister is introducing the provision now is that it is recognised that the current situation, where <Col N="633" /> the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources makes such decisions even though he is the only shareholder in Dublin Port and in port companies, represents a conflict of interest. I expected a proper democratic process to be provided for such a radical change in relation to the bay. The Minister is providing, however, that there will be no democratic input by way of a development plan, regardless of whether there is a seven or 12 week period for public consultation. There will be no consultation in relation to the objectives that should be set for the bay.</P>
    <P>It is essential that there be an opportunity for councillors and the public to shape a development plan before there is development on the foreshore, particularly in areas of crucial amenity such as Dublin Bay and other foreshores around the country. The public will expect and demand an opportunity to have public consultation about the objectives of foreshore development and under what conditions it will be permitted. Instead, the Minister is saying that these decisions will be made in the first instance by the city or county manager and on appeal by An Bord Pleanála. There will be no democratic input into the objectives. There will simply be a right to object, which will have to be paid for, to proposals that are brought forward.</P>
    <P>Past efforts by the port board showed that 66% of the criteria under which an EIS was assessed were found to be poor or deplorably bad. There is a poor record here and no public confidence in the way this is being handled. My amendment No. 109, which seeks to ensure that these developments would only follow a development plan, will not be reached. There will be no debate on Part XV of the Bill which is only a Report Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>We did not have an opportunity on Second Stage or on Committee Stage to debate this issue. It was not even signalled on Second Stage that the matter would be introduced. Therefore, this is a highly undemocratic process of dealing with the amendments the Minister is proposing and, as a consequence of these amendments, the whole issue of assessing development on the foreshore will be undemocratic. The Minister needs to consider the area of foreshore development in the context of whether there are development plans. The principle of amendment No. 109 should be accepted to ensure that if there are areas of high amenity such as Dublin Bay, a development plan will be published, there will be proper consultation both by the democratically elected councillors and only then will planning applications be considered. This is the only way to proceed in relation to an amenity so valuable and so sensitive as Dublin Bay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to accommodate Deputies' concerns to achieve the extra time, we had to timetable each stage. There is a safeguard in section 12(16) which states that missing an internal deadline will not affect the validity of the plan. Therefore, as long as all stages are finalised <Col N="634" /> by the end of the two years, the plan will be valid and any internal slippages within the process will be tolerated under the Bill. There is no provision for extension of time given our experience with the current system where several extensions can be sought by local authorities. There is about five weeks not timetabled, which will give some flexibility, as Deputy Dukes pointed out. On decreasing the public consultation period by two weeks, this is more than compensated for by the extensive public consultation now provided for at the first stage.</P>
      <P>It is important to provide a degree of certainty in how these matters are dealt with. I recall when I last held this office introducing legislation in relation to An Bord Pleanála where the timespan for decisions on appeal were considerably decreased, with no diminution of the effort to make sure proper decisions were taken. As I have outlined, there is a degree of flexibility in the five weeks which are not timetabled. However, the two year period must stand.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton, obviously we will not reach that stage of the debate. Deputy Dukes has tabled a number of amendments. The Minister states that his amendment to the First Schedule which allows planning authorities to have objectives in their development plan in relation to foreshore, coupled with the existing requirement in section 34 means that planning decisions must be made having regard to the proper planning and sustainable development, including the provisions of a development plan. This means that planning authorities will be obliged to include objectives in their plan in order to make decisions on development on the foreshore. This can be done when drawing up a new plan or by variation of an existing plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point must be made that in the interim, before local authorities draw up a plan, anyone can submit a planning application for anything on the foreshore. This means there is no democratic input, that they must just go through the city or county manager and appeal to An Bord Pleanála. A stay will have to be put on applications so that local authorities can draw up development plans for the foreshore. This has not been happening because they did not have the power to do so.</P>

      <P>On that point, I share Deputy Bruton's concern that Part XV has appeared before us on Report Stage. This was not signalled on Second Stage. The Minister did not table an amendment on Committee Stage. This is effectively new legislation and it is not appropriate that the House should be used to slip in legislation of this kind. I am aware legislation has been under consideration for some time in relation to changing the foreshore legislation generally. Perhaps this should be done in that context. I am deeply unhappy and oppose the Government introducing legislation dealing with foreshore development at this late stage and hav<Col N="635" /> ing it effectively enacted by default because, given the time constraints, we will not have time to examine this part of the Bill in detail, which we should be able to do on Committee Stage. If the Minister intended to change the foreshore legislation, he should have introduced the issue on Committee Stage when we would have had an opportunity to consider it in detail rather than slipping it in on Report Stage.</P>

It is far better to include this provision for considerable certainty in an area where there was no provision heretofore. If a planning application is made and the local authority has any reservations about it, it can defer the application until such time as it has an opportunity to review its plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me a little bit of latitude to make a few remarks at this stage, given that we are reaching the end of a lengthy consideration of this Bill. It has been an extremely lengthy process and I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his staff for the way they approached the debate on this Bill. <Col N="637" /> It is fair to say the Minister approached the debate with a very open mind. On Report Stage and more so on Committee Stage there has been a readiness on the part of the Minister to meet amendments tabled by the Opposition. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to get agreement on a series of amendments relating to how we deal with development in Gaeltacht areas, on our architectural heritage, the control of development, enforcement, special development zones and the application of that system to housing, some aspects of the activities of An Bord Pleanála, particularly on hearings relating to environmental impact assessments, developments by local and State authorities and on regulations. In particular I have been looking forward to telling the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, how happy I am that of the 12 areas I proposed for an active form of regulation, he has accepted eight and added two off his own bat which I did not expect. Colleagues have said the Government might regret this, and they may be right in the short-term as there will be more work involved in passing the regulations, but I firmly believe, and I know the Minister agrees, that the democratic process can only gain through such an approach.</P>
    <P>Personally I have been very heartened by the approach of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to the debate. We have made a number of useful amendments and when the Bill is enacted planning law will be improved by a measurable margin as a result of our efforts.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said at the beginning of the debate, not in any sense of carping criticism but as constructively as possible, that although I believe we have passed some substantial improvements to planning law, I insist that the improvements will be redundant unless planning authorities are equipped with resources in terms of funding and personnel to make them work. For example, the enforcement chapter is a major improvement on current enforcement provisions. However, it will remain a dead letter if we do not have proper resourcing of local authorities to ensure enforcement takes place. The provisions in the Bill on strategic development zones, particularly as they will apply to housing following the Minister's amendment, will require local planning authorities to be a great deal more vigilant then ever before in inspecting the quality of development as it takes place. Deputy Gilmore, and I am sure the Minister, knows what I am talking about when I say that for far too long we have put up with the daily effects of deficiencies, not in planning, but in the way plans are translated into reality. That will continue to be the case unless and until we give local authorities the necessary resources. Having done a good and commendable job in terms of the Bill, I invite the Minister to turn his attention to giving local authorities the resources they will need to make the constructive work a reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Dukes in paying tribute to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who <Col N="638" /> showed a great degree of flexibility in the way he handled the Bill in the House. It was a very satisfying experience for myself and Deputy Dukes as Opposition spokespersons to find ourselves tabling amendments and to have a Minister who was prepared to listen to what we had to say and to amend the Bill accordingly, sometimes on the hoof. I pay warm tribute to the Minister for that flexibility and the Bill is better for it.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to the Minister's officials. This is a comprehensive and complex Bill and we all appreciate the work in preparing such legislation and the management of the process as it is debated in the Oireachtas. Having public servants sit in silence through 56 hours of debate on Committee Stage, followed by Report Stage, in addition to the debate in the Seanad, is a particular form of cruelty to them. I think we should at some time give consideration to having a different style of debate on Committee Stage which would allow an engagement between Members and departmental officials who prepare legislation and who have a detailed knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes said we have made many changes to the Bill. I am not fully happy with it as it stands, which is in the nature of our parliamentary system. However, on Committee and Report Stages we managed to make very considerable improvements to the Bill. I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Dukes, and to Deputies Joe Higgins and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin who contributed on Committee or Report Stages. However, I must express some disappointment at the lack of performance by the Green Party. This is the most significant environmental legislation to come before the House in the lifetime of the Dáil. We spent 56 hours on Committee Stage without a single appearance by either of the Green Party Deputies or a single amendment being tabled by them. We had a couple of guest appearances by Deputy Gormley during the course of one day on Report Stage. Yesterday afternoon, for example, when we were debating the key issues of the introduction of a planning charge, the restriction of the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and the restriction of the right to seek judicial reviews, neither of the Green Party Deputies appeared in the House to support me and Deputy Dukes when we were making the case to defend the rights of the public in the planning process. I am puzzled as to why the members of the Green Party, who are normally first up on the Order of Business to seek additional time for debating issues, did not apply their minds, roll up their sleeves and get stuck in to this important environmental legislation. I say that with a considerable amount of sadness because in our efforts to protect the environment as Opposition spokespersons on the environment, Deputy Dukes and I would have expected the Green Party to be the first source of support.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle and the officers of the House for the assistance given to us as Opposition spokespersons in tabling amendments.</P>

I sincerely thank Deputies Dukes and Gilmore for their fulsome praise of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. When I realised I would be here today I spoke to him for some time last night and he asked me to thank, as I wish to do myself, Deputies Dukes, Gilmore and others for the time-consuming preparation and their very generous approach to ensure we had the best possible legislation. There were a significant number of amendments in the Seanad and a further substantial raft in the Dáil. As Deputy Dukes said, the Minister was quite prepared to listen to and put in place the very sensible proposals put forward.</P>
      <P>Planning law is a powerful instrument for change and sustainable development and it is important that as we make changes we fully prepare for the future. It is important that we prepare fully, as we make these changes. The matter is being looked at seriously by the Minister to determine the increased resources required at local authority level.</P>
      <P>I thank the officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government for their unstinting support and dedication. Their work did not start and end here after 56 hours. The preparatory work entailed many long nights. I also thank the Deputies opposite for their efforts.</P>

      <P>On 5 May the Irish and British Governments issued a statement expressing our belief that the remaining steps necessary to secure full implementation of the Agreement can be achieved by June 2001. A letter setting out the Governments' proposals and commitments in the areas of rights and equality, security, policing and justice and prisoners was also circulated to the parties. This was an important step towards creating a context of confidence in which others could make their <Col N="640" /> intentions known. It paved the way for the statement issued by the IRA on 6 May and for the decision to re-enter the Executive taken by the Ulster Unionist Council on 27 May. The restoration order signed by the Secretary of State returning power to the Assembly and Executive entered into force on 30 May. All the institutions under the Agreement are now back working to their full capacity, taking forward the important work to be done in each of their respective areas of competence.</P>
      <P>As a result of these developments we are now closer than ever before to achieving full implementation of the Agreement and have a secure and agreed basis on which it is to be achieved. There are difficult issues which remain to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Legislation to give effect to the Patten proposals on policing is before Parliament at Westminster. When it was published last month I expressed concern about certain aspects of the Bill. In discussions with the British Government, including in my meeting with the Secretary of State on 31 May, and in consultations with the parties I have stressed that if it is to achieve the representative, accountable and effective police service envisaged in the Agreement it is vitally important that the legislation give full effect to the Patten recommendations.</P>
      <P>Progress must also be made on the question of arms. The IRA's statement of 6 May was a major step forward. It is important that the commitments made in the statement are honoured. I look forward to an early report from Mr. Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa on the proposed confidence building measure. The de Chastelain commission will continue its work and will report to the two Governments.</P>
      <P>We have made solid progress in recent weeks. I hope we will be able to build steadily on that progress, realising the Agreement's full potential. As I have said before, the full implementation of the Agreement is the will of the people of Ireland, North and South. It remains the highest priority of the Government. We will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government and pro-Agreement parties to secure that outcome.</P>

      <P>What are the Minister's concerns about the Patten proposals? I am aware that he has made general comments in the past but will he be specific? Is he concerned about the naming of the police force, symbols and accountability or all three? On accountability for the RUC and its successor, the Northern Ireland Police Service, given that the Human Rights Commission in the North will be followed by a similar commission in the South, does he see moves in the direction of greater accountability for the Garda Síochána along the lines of the new Northern Ireland Police Service as a <i>quid pro quo </i>or complementary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make the distinction that the Garda Síochána enjoys the full confi<Col N="641" /> dence of everybody in the community. That is not the position unfortunately in the case of the RUC. The Patten proposals suggest a new model for policing in Northern Ireland distinct from the system in operation in any other part of the United Kingdom where the chief constable is the focus of authority in local constabularies. Under the new model, authority would be vested in a policing board representative of both communities. It would also have independent members and have accountability mechanisms built in to ensure it would herald a new beginning in policing in Northern Ireland in a way that would allow those members of the RUC who have behaved professionally in the past to pursue their careers and representatives of the broad Nationalist community in particular to encourage its members to pursue policing as a profession in this new context.</P>
      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions the concerns we have expressed since the policing Bill was published. There were indications in the Second Stage speech of the Secretary of State, of movement in certain areas. There are issues under discussion. I have been in direct contact with the SDLP and Sinn Féin in relation to their concerns. The Government wishes to see faithful implementation of the Patten proposals to ensure there will be a police force which will be representative and provide a basis for full participation and its full acceptance by everyone in Northern Ireland. That is the basic requirement. Everything is predicated on achieving that objective. The Patten recommendations provide a blueprint. Those who are <i>au fait </i>with them will know that they must be reflected in the legislative framework under consideration in the Westminster Parliament.</P>

      <Quest>the number of occasions he has raised the United States blockade of Cuba with the United States authorities; the outcome of such discussions; if his attention has been drawn, in particular, to the hardship being caused by the difficulties in acquiring certain medical equip- ment from abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government is opposed to the United States embargo imposed against Cuba. We are joined in this opposition by our European Union partners. We want to see this embargo end. We have consistently expressed this view to the United States Government and regularly supported resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to note that there has been some recent progress. The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee has voted to authorise sales of food and medicine to Cuba. The House of Representatives and Senate Appropriations Committees have also backed the measure which is shortly expected to be considered in plenary session. While it is a matter for the United States authorities, the adoption of such a measure would mark a significant further positive step following last year's easing of restrictions on the delivery of food and medicine to non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>President Castro welcomed the congressional moves last week on the occasion of a visit to Havana by a delegation of US businessmen. He described the congressional debate as an important step in the right direction, though naturally he pointed out that what Cuba wanted was a complete lifting of the embargo. In this, the EU and Cuba are agreed.</P>
      <P>European Union policy is defined by the common position on Cuba, which was originally adopted under the Irish Presidency in December 1996. The aim of the common position is not to enforce by external coercion of any kind, but to encourage, a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people. While opposed to such isolating measures as the economic embargo, the common position nevertheless makes clear that EU full co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the absence of fundamental human and political rights.</P>
      <P>The common position is subject to six-monthly review. At the General Affairs Council earlier this week it was again confirmed, because a careful evaluation of the situation in Cuba over the last six months led to the unavoidable conclusion that there had not been substantive change as regards basic political and human rights, and there appeared to be no early prospect of evolution towards a pluralistic democracy. Nevertheless, it was agreed that the Union should deploy further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue in the political, economic and human rights spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its recent session, the UN Commission on Human Rights, with EU support, adopted a resolution criticising Cuba's human rights performance, and calling on it to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN. In a comment on the resolution, the EU also expressed <Col N="643" /> continuing concern about the impact on Cuba of the economic embargo. Following the adoption of the resolution, Cuba withdrew an invitation to a European Union Troika at Deputy Foreign Minister level, which was due to visit Havana at the end of April. Cuba also withdrew its application to join the new ACP Convention.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Ireland and its EU partners continue to believe that confidence-building measures should be pursued with Cuba in the spirit of the common position. It would also be helpful if the current moves to at least modify the food and medicine elements of the economic embargo were to succeed, pending a complete and definitive lifting of the embargo as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the first part of the Minister's reply and I share with him the view on the Cuban blockade that has been expressed on all sides of the House. Unfortunately, the second part of the Minister's reply, where he outlines a great number of conditions, creates problems for me. Does he intend to inform the common position on Cuba that any ship that delivers, for example, even medicines and food to Cuba faces 180 days exclusion from the US? Does he agree that the impact on the economy is such as to make impossible the purchase of vital medicines, even if they have been show-cased by medical exporting firms? Is he not moved by the report following the recent visit by medical personnel from Ireland &ndash; wonderful people &ndash; who concentrated especially on how the shortage of medical supplies was affecting children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing common position was again confirmed only last week for a further six month period. The Deputy raises concerns about the effect of the embargo, even in the context of the delays in administering medicines that are getting through to the people in Cuba who require them. I take his point. However, the common position is linked to the need for Cuba to institute some internal political reforms. That is consistent with the democratic principles to which the EU has shown an attachment, even recently for example, in relation to the composition of one of its member state Governments in terms of making the point about the need in the performance of Government policy for an unambiguous adherence to these democratic principles.</P>
      <P>Only the US and Israel have voted against the UN resolutions for the lifting of the embargo. We seek to ensure that in every respect all humanitarian assistance that can possibly be given, particularly in the area of medicine, would get through. In view of the common position taken by the EU, it would be helpful if the dialogue which the EU is committed to holding with Cuba could achieve some results in some of the areas I have mentioned to ensure that we make real progress on this issue.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that there is a perceived inconsistency between the position taken at the UN and the common position. It was a brave and good decision of Ireland to vote the way it did at the UN in relation to the blockade, which is perceived by many countries as illegal in international terms. However, under the common position there is a series of conditions regarding transformations that must occur before the force of a position taken by the UN is vindicated. Does the Minister agree that there is a perceived inconsistency between the rather rhetorical position taken at the UN and that taken in the common position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>From its inception as the European Economic Community in 1957, with six founding members, the European Union has shown a remarkable capacity to adapt to changing circumstances. Having increased throughout successive enlargements to 15 member states and seen a significant extension in Union competences following the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, the Union over the past decade has faced the task of responding to unprecedented change in central and eastern Europe. The Union has responded to these challenges with an imaginative strategy for enlargement, and a vigorous programme of internal reform.</P>
      <P>The imperative now is to complete the transformation already under way, through the series of accession negotiations now in train with 12 countries and the process of adapting the Union's institutions to meet the demands of enlargement, through the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. The House will be aware that the Intergovernmental Conference is tackling a number of the key institutional issues left unresolved from Amsterdam, and the outcome will have an important bearing on the functioning of the Union well into the future. In this regard, I have emphasised repeatedly the importance we attach to ensuring that the balances which underpin the Union are fully maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is evident from recent statements by the German Foreign Minister, Mr. Fischer, President Chirac, and others, the central issue for the European Union at the moment is whether it can broaden and deepen at the same time. For our part, we are committed to enlargement on the <Col N="645" /> basis agreed at Helsinki, and through our participation in EMU have shown ourselves ready to go down the road of deepening the Union. However, the concept of further deepening will require clear analysis of what is meant. In this regard, the concept of flexibility, or enhanced co-operation, has captured considerable attention of late. We are ready to consider proposals in this area, but will want to be assured that extending its use is in the best interests of the Union as a whole, and that adequate safeguards are in place to guard against fragmentation, for example, in regard to the Single Market. In raising these concerns, and pointing to the need for greater clarity in the debate, we are simply seeking to ensure that decisions are taken which will serve to maintain the coherence of the Union now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The organic character of the European Union ensures that it will continue, as it has done in the past, to adapt to changing circumstances. As a Union of states and of peoples, it is required to respond to the wishes of the Governments and the citizens which make up the Union, to preserve both its credibility and its democratic legitimacy. While it is not possible, therefore, or, perhaps, even desirable, to pre-empt decisions which may be taken in the future on the further development of the Union, the essential point is that it should continue to build on the solid foundations already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if the meeting in the Azores gave any consideration to the external borders of the EU? How far will the Union integrate? We have talked in the past about broadening as well as deepening. How broad will the Union become? Will Turkey be included? What is to be the relationship with Russia, which is European as far as the Urals? </P>
      <P>On the question of integration and the balances referred to by the Minister, does he believe a case could be made for having a directly elected President of the EU Commission, with Commissioners being picked from those Members elected to the European Parliament? Has any consideration been given to that of late?</P>
      <P>Given that 60 million Europeans lost their lives in the first half of the last century, would he agreed that the integration and expansion of the Union is a vital part of the process of ensuring peace and stability on the continent of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The present enlargement process, as envisaged by the Helsinki conclusions, gives an indication of the outer reaches of the Union. What one would be talking about subsequent to that regarding the central Asian republics and Russia would be association agreements, for example, a relationship with recognises the interdependency of trade in that region in the outer periphery of the EU with those then neighbouring countries, but obviously one does not envisage the EU expanding much beyond what is now envisaged in terms of its effectiveness and <Col N="646" /> decision-making capacity and the ability to maintain coherence.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Turkey is being allowed proceed with providing us with the basic adherence to the Copenhagen criteria in terms of democratisation, human rights, etc., and that is to be welcomed. Obviously, Turkey is in a slightly different position than other applicant countries which are more advanced in that respect.</P>
      <P>On the question of further directly elected representatives within the Commission structure as part of one of the institutions of the EU and the prospect of parliamentarians becoming Commissioners, of course under the present treaties existing parliamentarians are not disbarred from becoming Commissioners, but the Intergovernmental Conference agenda to be completed at the Nice Summit at the end of this year is a reasonably restricted agenda. It is restricted because what are known as the &ldquo;Amsterdam leftovers&rdquo;. Questions of the extent to which qualified majority voting is to be advanced in terms of the decision-making process at the Council, the expansion of the Commission and the entitlement of each of the member states to a Commissioner, which is a majority view at this stage of the negotiations as expressed by member states, and the re-weighting of votes, are issues which require the full concentration of the member states in order for us to deal successfully with this intergovernmental conference in a relatively short time of 12 months, as envisaged.</P>
      <P>What will emerge from the Feira Summit next week is the addition of a discussion on the flexibility mechanism as part of the Intergovernmental Conference discussions to see if that can be successfully incorporated into the Nice conclusions, but the question of further institutional reform or some of the Deputy's suggestions will not form part of the present Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, and may or may not in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The suffering of the people of Iraq, especially children, and the problems in implementing the United Nations humanitarian programmes in Iraq are of deep concern to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I raised our concerns about the effects of the sanctions on the people of Iraq with the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Madeleine <Col N="647" /> Albright, in Washington in March, and urged the United States, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to seek to reduce the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for infrastructure. Mrs. Albright expressed sympathy with these concerns and at the same time pointed out the lack of co-operation by the Iraqi authorities with the positive humanitarian provisions in Resolution 1284, which was adopted by the Security Council on 17 December last but flatly rejected by Iraq. Our concerns have also been presented in discussions at official level with British counterparts.</P>
    <P>We consistently advocate further reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme, and continue to raise within the United Nations and the EU the urgent need to improve the conditions of the general population in Iraq.</P>
    <P>The serious humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people was witnessed recently during a week long visit by three members of the European Parliament, including Mr. Niall Andrews MEP, who wrote a report on the visit which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 6 June. The report highlighted a number of specific issues. The three members of the European Parliament intend to open up discussions on these issues with the European Commission and with all the political groups in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about recent reports of a large number of ships leaving Iraq with cargoes of oil and refined petroleum products for foreign buyers outside the UN oil for food programme. The income derived from this is not spent on buying essential supplies for Iraqi citizens. Such actions undermine the humanitarian relief programmes.</P>
    <P>I urge the Iraqi Government to comply with Security Council resolutions, particularly in relation to the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which is expected to be operational in August, and to co-operate adequately with the UN oil for food programme, in particular, to ensure equitable distribution to the civilian population of the supplies made available. I hope that with this co-operation and with greater awareness of the defects of the current sanctions regime, faster progress can be made in the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of sanctions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to square what is happening in Iraq with, for example, the United Nations Charter on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which states that the inhabitants of a given country do not forfeit basic economic, social and cultural rights by virtue of any determination that their leaders have violated norms relating to international peace and security? Given that that is the position in international law, is he happy to continue making the case that we will urge more humanitarian implementation of the oil for food programme; and would he <Col N="648" /> further comment on, or has his Department prepared a response to, the reports provided by the co-ordinators of humanitarian relief who resigned, Denis Halliday and Hans Von Sponeck?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, we agree with the view that a sanctions regime should take full account of economic, social and cultural rights, and I made clear that we have expressed our concern on these issues. There is also the obligation on us, as a member of the UN, to adhere to Security Council resolutions and, therefore, we have been impressing in every way possible on the UN Security Council to ensure that the practicalities of the implementation of these sanctions do not result in the horrendous situation from which many Iraqi citizens are suffering as a result of the sanctions regime and the refusal of that Government to respond to the international body representing the UN Security Council to deal with the question of the weapons of mass destruction inspections which has been the core of the problem for some years.</P>
      <P>We support the UN Security Council, therefore, in demanding full compliance by the Government of Iraq with the terms of its resolutions, which require the verification of the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Compliance with those resolutions will make it possible for the entire issue of sanctions against Iraq to be resolved. We are deeply concerned about the suffering being endured by the Iraqi people and the difficulties arising for the implementation of international humanitarian aid programmes as a result of the sanctions. We regret that Iraq has not so far complied fully with the resolutions and we urge the Government to comply with this and other relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
      <P>We have raised the issue in the relevant CFSP working group by requesting information from France and the UK. Despite the lack of opportunity at the UN arising from the absence of debate before this on the issue, the Irish permanent mission of the UN is in ongoing contact with members of the Security Council and with the UN secretariat regarding the further handling of the issue. At an open debate which took place on 17 April on the question of sanctions in general, not on Iraq as such, we sought a direct reference to Iraq in the common EU statement in this debate but we received no support from partners, who prefer to follow the wishes of the current Security Council President, Canada, to confine the debate to the general question of sanctions. Nevertheless, in obvious references to the situation in Iraq, the statement calls for sanctions to minimise the negative humanitarian impact on the general population, particularly the most vulnerable sectors, and to provide from the outset for humanitarian exemptions.</P>

      <P>The report of the three MEPs shows the degree of destruction of the infrastruc<Col N="649" /> ture, and particularly its impacts on the death and malnutrition of children. If one takes that as fact and puts it side by side with the other fact that on compliance over 80% of the weapons of destruction have been destroyed, how can one justify continuance of the sanctions which is totally out of proportion? Is the Minister satisfied from any talks he has had with Britain or the United States as to the conditions which would in fact end the sanctions? What is the purpose of the sanctions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What will end the sanctions immediately is if the Iraqi Government complies with the blueprint for the new UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission which has been set up to replace UNSCOM and is headed by Hans Blix, a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. On the need to get a new structure beyond UNSCOM, in view of the allegations of espionage, American bias, etc., there is, since 14 April, an opportunity for the Iraqi Government to respond positively. It is difficult to understand why such a regime is not responding positively given the huge suffering of its people.</P>

      <P>Israel has announced that its forces completely evacuated Lebanese territory by 24 May in conformity with UN security resolutions 425 and 426. A number of incidents took place during the Israeli withdrawal and in its immediate aftermath. Since then, the situation has remained relatively calm and appears to be stabilising. Hizbollah has not taken aggressive action against Israel and has been behaving with restraint. United Nations verification teams are moving through heavily-mined areas in southern Lebanon to determine whether Israel has withdrawn in accordance with Security Council resolutions 425 and 426, following which the Lebanese Government will be able to restore its effective authority in the area. So far, the preparations of the Lebanese Government for this appear to be moving slowly. We look forward to the Lebanese Government fully resuming its responsibilities. Both Lebanon and Syria have stated their support for the role of the UN in southern Lebanon following the withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the time of the announcement in early April by the Israeli Government that it intended to withdraw from Lebanon, I was particularly anxious to register with the UN the Government's concern about the safety and security of our personnel serving with UNIFIL. I wrote in this regard on 17 April to the Secretary General, <Col N="650" /> Mr. Kofi Annan. During my visit to the UN on 24 and 25 April, I met the Deputy Secretary General, Ms Louise Fréchette, and senior officials of the UN departments of peacekeeping operations and political affairs to discuss this issue. I emphasised the absolute priority the Government attaches to the safety and security of our troops. I was assured by the Deputy Secretary General that the UN shares our concerns for the safety and security of all UN personnel in southern Lebanon and that the UN is fully committed to sharing all information with troop contributing countries. This assurance has been honoured in the weeks since Israel's withdrawal.</P>
    <P>I have instructed our permanent representative to the United Nations in New York to liaise closely with the UN secretariat to ensure that the Government is kept fully informed. The UN department of peacekeeping operations holds meetings with the troop contributing countries on an ongoing basis, and our permanent mission to the UN attends these meetings. I am also keeping in touch with other Governments with a particular interest in the situation and I have had discussions with my opposite numbers from the United States and France among others. The Minister for Defence is also monitoring the situation very closely.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, in the context of the Israeli withdrawal, has asked all troop contributing countries to reinforce their contingents. On 30 May, in response to this request, the Government decided to deploy an additional 50 Defence Forces personnel with the 87th Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL until the end of its tour of duty in October 2000. Such deployment is to take place on receipt of satisfactory assurances concerning the safety of the UNIFIL mission. It was also decided to assign an engineer party comprising 60 personnel, together with necessary equipment, to undertake essential construction work in the IRISHBATT area of operations should the exigencies of the operational situation so require. Other troop contributing countries have also indicated that they await firm security guarantees before deploying additional personnel.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General will shortly furnish the Security Council with a report based on the second visit to the region by his special envoy. An important aspect of this report will be future co-operation between UNIFIL and the Lebanese authorities in implementing the later parts of the mandate. The report should also address the key issues of safety and security for UNIFIL personnel. The special envoy, Mr. Roed-Larsen, has indicated that all parties have pledged full co-operation with the UN.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that Ireland has one of the largest battalions serving in UNIFIL in Lebanon and has certainly the longest serving one. Has the Government considered withdrawing Irish troops from Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Government is monitoring the situation as a result of the Israeli with<Col N="651" /> drawal from south Lebanon. It hopes that the Irish battalion will be able to continue its operations there so that the completion of the mandate under resolutions 425 and 427 can be completed. It would indicate our full involvement since 1978 in what has been a 22 year process. In the absence of any security issues arising for the safety of our personnel, we would not only seek to ensure that our existing deployment would continue but would also be prepared to add to it based on a report providing us with certain guarantees for their security. We expect such a report in the next few days from Mr. Roed-Larsen who has returned from his second visit to that area having visited Syria, Lebanon, Israel and other interested parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is intended that the 50 additional Defence Forces personnel and the 60 engineering personnel, along with the necessary back-up equipment, will be deployed to the Irish battalion area to supplement the existing deployment there upon receipt of a report by us and our obtaining certain adequate guarantees concerning the safety of the people it is proposed would supplement our existing deployment. The fundamental consideration and paramount issue of successive Governments regarding our involvement in the UNIFIL project has been the safety of our personnel. While it is relatively calm at present and although one cannot predict what will happen in a military situation, all reasonable assurances can be given by the Government. I have indicated in reply to the main question the proactive steps which have been taken by me as Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence in keeping a close eye on this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 14, 35, 80 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided the opportunity &ldquo;for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;. The Patten report comprehensively addressed the broad range of important and sensitive issues related to policing. The Government welcomed the report and said that the early and effective implementation of its recommendations would form an essential part of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole.</P>
      <P>In his statement on 19 January, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland set out the British Government's position on the implementation of the Patten report. On 5 May 2000 the two Governments indicated the timetable planned for the implementation of the Patten report, including the passage of legislation by November 2000, with the appointment of the new policing board in January 2001 and the first process for recruits to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland to start in April 2001.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Police Bill on 16 May represented another step on the way to implementing the Patten recommendations. At that time, I indicated that certain aspects of the Bill gave cause for concern as they carried the risk that the new service would not succeed in winning the level of cross-community support that will be necessary to create a new beginning. However, I also stated my firm belief that these difficulties could be resolved in the context of the legislative process. An implementation plan dealing with each of the recommendations of the report was published on 6 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks, meetings have taken place at all levels, with the British Government and with the SDLP and Sinn Féin, on the legislative and other implications of full and faithful implementation of the Patten report. I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, on <Col N="653" /> 31 May, and our discussions focused on the areas of concern in the Police Bill. A number of welcome changes were signalled by the Secretary of State on that occasion. The Secretary of State's contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Bill on 6 June also indicated a number of areas which would be amended. The implementation of the Patten report was also discussed at a meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on 7 June. The Police Bill began Committee Stage at Westminster on Tuesday of this week, and a large number of amendments have been tabled by the SDLP and other parties represented on the committee.</P>
    <P>The Government remains fully committed to the view that full and effective implementation of the Patten recommendations is the way in which the report's vision of a representative police service acceptable to both communities can be delivered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and detailed response. I very much welcome the fact he is looking forward to full and effective implementation of the Patten report in relation to the police Bill and to the developments in regard to Committee Stage of that Bill in Westminster this week. Is there a line of communication open to the Minister enabling him to keep in regular contact? In regard to issues of concern, is there any mechanism in place to ensure there will be some kind of rapport with those in authority who will be implementing the recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of the very intense attention this matter is receiving from the Anglo-Irish division in my Department relates to the continuing discussions at all levels and ensuring that the legislative process in Westminster delivers a policing Act which will reflect full and effective implementation of the Patten report. As I indicated in my response in general terms, there have been some indications of improvement in the position in certain areas. Other outstanding areas remain to be dealt with and clearly we are in a position where ongoing consultation and discussion is taking place.</P>
      <P>The Government broadly supports the SDLP amendments, which have been listed, as being consistent with a shared view with the Nationalist community generally of what is required to ensure that community encourages and supports the full implementation of the Patten recommendations, as enacted. That will involve participation on the police boards, etc., and a broad welcome and encouragement to the community at large to view policing as a career which would be acceptable in every community in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Following his meeting on 31 May with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, did the Minister get such assurance which would make him confident of the full implemen<Col N="654" /> tation of the Patten report? Having had sight of the amendments sought on Committee Stage of the debate on the police Bill, is the Minister still confident that the Patten report can be implemented in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Mandelson, on 31 May in Dublin involved what was a very long and comprehensive agenda dealing specifically with this issue and one could certainly say there was constructive dialogue and that progress could be reported. Clearly, this is ongoing and we are continuing to discuss specific matters of continuing concern at this stage of the legislative process. The public position of both Governments is that they support full implementation of the Patten recommendations. Clearly, in the detail of the legislative process, we need to ensure that is reflected fully once the various stages of the legislation are finalised. One would expect Committee Stage to take place over the coming two to three weeks and we will then have Report Stage. The Bill will then have to go to the House of Lords.</P>
      <P>During all of this process, dialogue is taking place on an ongoing basis to ensure we get this right. It would be a great shame and a major problem in terms of full implementation of the Agreement and proceeding as we all want to proceed and have so declared, if we were not to get this right and were to end up without the full support of the Nationalist parties. There is a need to recognise the requirement for full implementation and to recognise the sensitivities involved for others as well and to proceed on an open and constructive basis. I hope the progress we have been making can continue so that we get a successful conclusion to these deliberations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say what contact he has had with political parties in Northern Ireland since 7 June on this matter? Does he anticipate that the name, RUC, will disappear entirely or will it remain in some format in the new legislation governing the police service in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the present draft of the Bill refers to the Secretary of State having the ultimate discretion after consultation with the parties. During the Second Stage debate many views were expressed on that matter. Discussions continue to seek to find a solution which will ensure the full acceptance of the new policing dispensation among all members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a recognition in the Bill of the sacrifice RUC officers have made in the past as Patten recommended the need for such recognition. We are aware of the inclusion of the RUC George Cross foundation in the Bill and of the need to deal with widows and people who have suffered as a result of and who have been affected by the violence. These are all issues which are given legislative expression in the Bill. We need to see <Col N="655" /> full implementation of the Patten report in all its respects and these are issues which are matters of continuing discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the matters raised in the House will assist in ensuring the full implementation of the report, in an inclusive manner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 7 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The European Union and the United States hold summit meetings twice yearly. The most recent meeting was held near Lisbon on 31 May last. The practice is that the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission represent the EU at these summits. At the summit on 31 May, the EU was represented by Prime Minister Guterres, Commission President Prodi and Secretary General &ndash; High Representative Solana. The US delegation was led by President Clinton. In accordance with established practice, the Presidency subsequently reported to the other member states on the discussions which took place.</P>
      <P>A meeting at Foreign Minister level, where the EU was represented by Foreign Minister Gama, Secretary General &ndash; High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten, and the US by Secretary of State Albright took place. In addition, a meeting of Trade and Economic Ministers was held, where the EU was represented by Portugal's Finance and Economy Minister, Pina Moura, and Commissioner Lamy. The US delegation at this meeting was led by US Trade Representative Barshefsky and included Secretary of Commerce Daley and other senior US representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holding of regular EU-US summits became an established practice as a result of the Trans-Atlantic Declaration of 1990, which gave a new impulse to EU-US relations. The summits were held annually until 1995 when it was agreed that they should be held twice yearly. While con<Col N="656" /> tact between the two sides is an ongoing process, the formal twice yearly summits provide a very useful forum for dialogue on matters of mutual concern and interest.</P>
    <P>The Presidency reported that the most recent summit on 31 May was conducted in a cordial and constructive atmosphere. The ongoing points of disagreement between the EU and the US in the trade area were discussed and both sides committed themselves to working together to reach solutions as quickly as possible. The summit issued agreed joint statements on south east Europe, HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa, on prospects for a new round of global trade negotiations under the aegis of the World Trade Organisation and on data privacy. I am arranging to have copies of these statements placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>There was a wide-ranging discussion at the summit on global political concerns, including Russia, Ukraine, nuclear disarmament, Africa, the Middle East peace process, prospects for the global economy and combating drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the AIDS issue which was discussed at the summit. He will be aware that somewhere in the region of 500 million women in the Third World will not see the age of 55 because of the lack of proper medical facilities there. Has he had an opportunity to consider the proposal I put forward and raised with his predecessor for the creation of a trans-Atlantic foundation located in Dublin to promote North American-EU co-operation, particularly in tackling issues of the kind mentioned, where Dublin would become a centre for study and co-operative action? Will he consider that proposal? It would enhance our prestige and give us an opportunity to put on the agenda issues of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of the specific proposal made by the Deputy. I will follow it up. When the Taoiseach returned from his trip to Africa recently he took up the global issue of AIDS. The pandemic that exists in Africa poses huge challenges not only to that continent but to the developed world in terms of sustainable development and so on. He was in discussion with President Prodi to impress on him the need for regional responses rather than trying to deal with the problem on a country by country basis so great is the issue. The US has designated AIDS as a national security issue and not merely a health one where their central interests are at risk. The impact of AIDS in terms of life expectancy in many beleaguered African countries particularly, but not solely, and the impact of that on economic sustainability and political stability is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the EU-US summit, the task force on communicable diseases has started to bring together technical experts in speciality areas such as HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis and anti-microbial resistance to develop joint approaches <Col N="657" /> to surveillance, response, research and related issues for co-operation. This effort will supplement and complement co-operation already under way between our development systems programmes in the two continents.</P>
    <P>Clearly this is an issue that is of the highest political priority and one would hope that this co-operation at EU and US level will bring about some real benefits for a beleaguered continent facing a pandemic of horrendous proportions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Minister's reference to the WTO, will he give more details on what was discussed and specifically the relationship of such discussions to the perceived diminution of the role of UNCTAD in the international community? There is a widespread perception among developing countries that the role of UNCTAD is being dislodged by a rather exclusive and narrow focus in the WTO discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the current US-EU trade disputes, it is important to recall, as indicated to the US side by President Prodi at the recent summit, that they account for about 4% to 5% of overall trade and can be controlled. The major outstanding disputes concern the EU banana import regime, the ban on imports of hormone related beef, the EU legislation on aircraft hush kits, EU concerns about genetically modified foodstuffs and US legislation on foreign sales corporations. The US has also expressed concern about competition between Airbus and Boeing.</P>
      <P>In relation to the prospects for a new round of global trade negotiations, at the summit both the EU and US sides reaffirmed their intention to build on the constructive work which has been ongoing in Geneva for the past six months following the failure of the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle to try to launch a new round during the course of the year and reiterated their common view that the WTO agenda should include the social issues of labour and the environment not as a matter of protectionism but as a matter of social justice and sustainability.</P>
      <P>The European Union also remains firmly convinced that a new broad based round to be completed in a reasonably short period, say three years, should remain the objective. The EU will continue to work towards this end. Realistically it seems unlikely at this stage that a new round could be successfully launched this year. However, it remains a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Minister reflecting on the fact that the net loss to Africa from the Uruguay Round was $3 billion, there are no prospects for Africa on a round conducted on anything like the same principles. In relation to UNCTAD, which was a United Nations agency where there was developing country participation, the widespread perception is that it has been sidelined in favour of a trade led option. Is that not a great concern for a country like Ireland <Col N="658" /> that one would expect to be supporting UNCTAD?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a detailed and considered reply on what he sees as a diminishing role for UNCTAD in this context. There is a recognition that the next WTO round must take into account the traditionally disadvantaged position of Africa in economic terms <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world. However, those matters which were seen in the past as merely health issues are now impacting in a way that will require the collective genius of us all to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The world trade talks should be conducted on a more even handed basis this time as the chairman is from New Zealand for the first three years and from Thailand for the second three years. That will give Third World countries an opportunity to redress certain imbalances. Has the Minister interested himself in the trade element of the talks between the EU and the US which have not been harmonious? I, together with the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Higgins, was a member of a delegation that went to Washington. We were left in no doubt by some members of the House of Representatives that the EU may again be involved in a trade war because of certain disagreements. One of them affects Ireland to a considerable degree, the use of certain hormones which occur naturally in cattle. The Americans insist that beef produced by the inducement of such hormones should be entitled to be exported to the rest of the world, particularly Europe. However, Europe does not agree. I agree with the Americans as do Irish farmers and the meat industry. We should take a tough stance within the European Union to see that is allowed. There is no evidence to suggest these hormones are injurious to health. They are naturally occurring&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says as regards his recent visit to the US. This has always been an area of contention between the EU and the US, particularly in relation to agriculture where there is a different economic basis from that in the EU. The EU ban on hormone treated beef has been challenged successfully by the US under the WTO and sanctions have been imposed since June 1999. Discussions are ongoing with a view to substituting EU compensation for US trade sanctions. It appears that the EU position is that it is prepared to suffer the penalty of compensation rather than have hormone treated beef introduced into the European Union.</P>

      <P>I am very much a European as far as hormones in beef are concerned. There is a wide divergence of opinion on GM foods.

      <P>A consultative forum will be established on GMOs which will report to the next EU-US summit. The launch of the EU-US biotechnology consultative forum was announced at the summit and this will comprise eminent persons from outside government. It is expected the forum will provide a venue for important discussions among independent experts and contribute to a better understanding of the difficult issues which arise.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the forum's report will be considered at the next EU-US summit. Where trade in agricultural biotechnology products is concerned, discussions have begun on regulatory issues, including as a priority practical means to facilitate trade in accordance with regulatory requirements of the importing country.</P>
      <P>The issue of GMOs is of great importance and concern to governments and consumers. Together with the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I will continue to closely monitor developments in exchanges between the European Union and the US in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference began in February of this year with a meeting of Foreign Ministers and is due to conclude at the Nice European Council in December. The conference has held five meetings to date at ministerial level, while the preparatory group of personal representatives, on which Ireland is represented by Noel Dorr, has met on a further nine occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference chiefly comprises those items left unresolved from the negotiation of the Amsterdam Treaty, namely the size and composition of the Commission, the re-weighting of votes in Council, the possible extension of qualified majority voting and changes to the institutions necessitated by enlargement. The aim of the Intergovernmental Conference is to ensure that the EU and its insti<Col N="660" /> tutions can continue to work effectively following enlargement.</P>
    <P>Ireland's objective for the conference is to prepare the EU for enlargement, while maintaining the carefully constructed balances and relationships between the Institutions and the member states which underpin the EU. We, therefore, attach particular priority to maintaining the right of each member state to nominate a full member of the Commission. This is an important element in enhancing the democratic legitimacy of the EU in the eyes of its citizens. I am encouraged by the level of support for this principle among our partners. However, as with all other issues, the question will not be resolved finally until negotiations are concluded.</P>
    <P>While we do not believe a re-weighting of Council votes is entirely necessary, we could agree to some modest change provided the reform package as a whole is satisfactory, particularly with regard to the Commission. The conference has considered various re-weighting schemes but the discussion remains very much at a preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>We are taking a constructive attitude to the possible extension of QMV, while insisting that in certain areas, such as taxation, the retention of unanimity is appropriate. Given the range of national positions, it is fair to say there are relatively few articles for which there is universal support for a move from unanimity. However, it remains likely that the final outcome will see a further increase in the already large number of articles governed by qualified majority voting.</P>
    <P>The Feira European Council later this month will decide on possible additions to the original Intergovernmental Conference agenda. One item likely to be included is flexibility or closer co-operation. The conference is likely to be asked to ease the rules governing the use of closer co-operation, perhaps by removing the veto provision, or by permitting fewer than half the EU's total membership to participate in some future arrangement. While not opposed to flexibility in principle, we will wish to be reassured that any provision for increased use does not undermine the principles and practices on which the EU is constructed.</P>
    <P>Other issues considered thus far at the Intergovernmental Conference include reform of the Court of Justice and changes to the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the Committee of the Regions. In all these areas, we are seeking to maintain the essential balances which underpin these institutions. I will continue to seek to ensure that the eventual outcome takes account of our national concerns, while contributing to the effective functioning of an enlarged EU.</P>

It is fair to say that, given the considerable discussion which has taken place on flexibility, this is an issue which will be added to the Intergovernmental Conference's agenda.</P>
      <P>The French Foreign Minister, Mr. Vedrine, will take over the Presidency after the Portuguese term and has indicated he is in favour of a restrictive agenda. The French are anxious to ensure the Intergovernmental Conference has a successful outcome at Nice, the best guarantee of which is to restrict the agenda to the Amsterdam leftovers, which can be easily listed but not so easily resolved. Together with the idea of an enhanced co-operation mechanism, this will form the basis of the discussions.</P>
      <P>The Council will also hold a discussion with Mr. Herzog on progress on the idea of a charter of fundamental rights which is currently under discussion by a technical group on which some members sit. It seems that a political declaration is favoured rather than a legal basis being given to those rights which would have major treaty amendment implications. However, this is a matter for discussion by the Heads of State. Mr. Herzog will take on board the views of the Heads of State in determining how this issue will progress over the coming six months. However, I do not expect the matter to be concluded before the Nice summit.</P>

      <P>If that is the case it would mean the rights issue would have retreated to the area of being somewhat rhetorical rather than legal. At the same time, flexibility is being sought on unspecified areas. For what is the flexibility being sought among groups who would be less than full members of the EU?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has to move from the conceptual to the pragmatic and this is what the next six months will be about. I am interested in what new areas of competencies the enhanced co-operation mechanism will involve and for what purpose. It must be remembered that we already have an enhanced co-operation mechanism under existing EU treaties, Article 43 of the general provisions and Article 11 of the First Pillar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point is that this can only be triggered on the basis of a Commission initiative <Col N="662" /> and must have a QMV vote to proceed. The discussions concern whether we amend the requirement for a majority of states to trigger the mechanism and whether a member state should have the right to appeal to the Council if it feels its national interests are affected.</P>
    <P>I am more of a pragmatist than a visionary and I am reassured by Mr. Vedrine's suggestion that there is no question of unravelling existing Community-wide practices. In other words, what has been achieved on a committee basis will not be compromised by the proposed changes. Therefore, the concerns expressed by member states need to be addressed in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1999 the Development Council considered the results of a number of detailed independent evaluations of European Community development assistance. On the policy side, the evaluations identified the absence of an integrated up-to-date statement on overall EU development policy as contributing to a lack of coherence in the delivery of EU aid. The Council called on the Commission to prepare a draft policy statement on EC development aid to be presented to the Council in 2000.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, the Commission published a communication on EC development aid policy which was discussed by the Council at its meeting on 18 May. The draft policy statement set out in the communication seeks to strengthen the poverty focus of all Community aid programmes. It also proposes streamlining the programme by focusing it on areas where action by the Community has a clear comparative advantage.</P>
      <P>The communication also highlights the need for greater coherence between the Community's aid programme and other external policies such as in the trade area. The Commission announced that it will soon present an action plan dealing with coherence. It is also strengthening its internal procedures to ensure greater coherence in policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the management side, the external evaluations were very critical of the Commission's performance. In response to this external criticism the Commission has accepted that &ldquo;EC external assistance programmes have a reputation for slow and unresponsive delivery, poor quality <Col N="663" /> and excessively centralised and rigid procedures&rdquo;. The most visible expression of this inefficiency is in the huge backlog, now estimated at 20 billion euros, of aid funds that have been committed to aid programmes and projects but have yet to be disbursed. The average delay in disbursing committed funds has increased from three years to four and a half years during the past five years.</P>
    <P>On 16 May the Commission published a communication on the reform of the management of external assistance. That communication, together with the communication on aid policy, laid the foundations for a much needed thorough reform of the Community's external assistance programme. The communication on reform of aid management sets out a radical programme for restructuring aid management. That includes a move to the multi-annual programming of aid, the strengthening of internal evaluation mechanisms, the location of all phases in the identification and implementation of an aid project within the one unit instead of being dispersed among numerous directorates and greater decentralisation of decision making to Commission offices in the field. The communication sets the objective of creating a new body for the delivery of EC aid which might even be established outside of the Commission.</P>
    <P>While accepting much of the criticism leveled against the EC aid programme, the Commission also notes that some reform measures are outside its control. In particular, it points to the need for budgetary approval for additional staff to reflect the fact that the Commission has had to undertake significant new aid commitments, particularly in the Balkans. It also calls for less micro-management by the member states of aid projects through the proliferation of management committees that oversee Commission activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been deeply concerned about the effectiveness of the Community aid programme. For some time we have been critical of the excessive internal bureaucracy that has caused significant delays in the delivery of aid, including urgently needed food aid. We have also called for a greater poverty focus in the delivery of aid and for more EC aid to be spent in the least developed countries.</P>
    <P>As the world's fifth largest aid donor and the world's largest donor of emergency humanitarian aid, the Community is a crucial partner for developing countries. There is room for significant improvement in the implementation of this huge and complex aid programme. I welcome these two important recent Commission communications which represent a comprehensive attempt by the Commission to rectify serious policy and management weaknesses. Ireland will press for the speedy implementation of the Commission's management reform programme and for the early adoption by the Council of an overall EU policy on development assistance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Clare Short, Britain's International Development Secretary, has criticised the EU's aid delivery as being the worst in the world? What is his response to that description? Is it the case that about 25% of the 1999 Irish aid budget was channelled through the EU? Does he consider some of this money would have been better spent and administered on a national basis through our NGOs who do fantastic work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the community aid programme, about 15% of the total aid budget goes to the Irish NGO programme. There is a need for capacity building within the NGO sector to ascertain in what way it can deal with further participation by NGOs in our aid programme to lead to economically sustainable programmes that will allow capacity building within developing counties. They are not concerned only or focused solely on emergency aid programmes. As partners in the UN and in the European Union, we have international obligations to provide a contribution to these organisations who also have a role in this area. It would remiss of Ireland not to make those contributions given our international standing and obligations as members of those organisations. We have been very strong in our criticism of the mechanisms used internally in those organisations, particularly the EU which is under discussion here, in terms of how they deliver programmes. Given the external evaluation and the two Commission communications to which I referred in my reply, there has been a pretty frank admission of the need for serious and fundamental reform. As members of the Union, our job is to ensure that reform is implemented.</P>

      <P>Clare Short has her own inimitable way of expressing her opinions. I am expressing mine, perhaps in my own inimitable way but with more caution, as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who is unfortunately unable to be here today, is more expert than I in the detail of this area. As the world's largest donor of emergency aid and the world's fifth largest donor of aid generally, it is an issue of serious concern that 20 billion euros of aid funds based on commitments made have not yet been disbursed, and that must be addressed. As to whether the EU's record on aid delivery is the worst in the world, I am not qualified to say, but I accept it is not the best in the world.</P>

      <P>Is it true that our efforts and the efforts of our NGOs are being frustrated to an <Col N="665" /> appalling degree by red tape in many of the countries to which we give aid? At a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday a representative of Concern informed us that there is still 95% duty payable on lorries and other vehicles brought out to Ethiopia to distribute aid. While the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, seems to have got an agreement that this duty would be eliminated, that has not been done. Much of our effort is being dissipated due to obstruction by Governments such as the Ethiopian government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the Minister of State when she returns with a view to bringing forward a more considered reply to the Deputy's supplementary question. Our development aid programme has been externally evaluated by the OECD and we are highly praised for the criteria we used, the objectivity of that criteria and the system we have utilised for the delivery of Irish Aid, as it is known throughout the world. We are currently preparing a memorandum for Government to ascertain how we can increase the level of aid in volume terms and in percentage terms over the period to meet our UN obligations over time. We also need to establish what that will involve, given the significant volume increase envisaged, subject to Cabinet approval. Such an increase would be based on the need to develop our systems and increase the number of personnel to ensure an accountability mechanism is in place to avoid a replication of the unfortunate experience of the EU programme where political commitments are being made at Council level without the necessary systems of management being in place in terms of resources and personnel to ensure that those programmes are delivered equitably and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, with someone like John O'Shea, it is far more productive to channel the money through NGOs than the UN, the EU or, in many cases, corrupt Governments, and that perhaps should be the way forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is exclusively the case. The objective of our aid programme is to build capacity within developing countries so that they can produce sustainable programmes for their people and build up their own expertise. NGOs have a very important role to play. Ireland's reputation is greatly enhanced by the outstanding work our NGOs do throughout the world. They are part of our aid programme. They are particularly good at delivering certain types of programmes and they will continue to be an important part of our aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposed improvement and increase in the level of development aid in the future, subject to Cabinet approval, there is also the need for our NGOs to ensure that they build sufficient capacity to develop programmes that <Col N="666" /> are not simply project led but that adopt a sustainable programme approach that will bring long-term benefit. At times of humanitarian disaster and catastrophe there will be a need for emergency aid. In many cases that is the time the mass media highlight the human suffering famine and disaster bring, but in the background we must always remember it is the operational slog of the developing programmes, which have a long-term sustainable benefit in these countries, that will ultimately determine the success or relative failure of our policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, to the House. I have already initiated the Bill in the Seanad where we had an interesting and worthwhile debate. All parties made some useful contributions and I was pleased to be able to accept the thrust and content of many of the suggested amendments. The Bill has benefited from that process.</P>
      <P>Its primary purpose is to establish a new regulatory body to be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which will carry out the regulation of charges levied at Irish airports, both by Aer Rianta and those levied by the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of services rendered to aircraft for take-off and approach.</P>
      <P>The new commission will have responsibility for five policy areas. These are: approval of airport and air traffic control charges; approval of ground-handling service providers at airports; the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland; administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports; and licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. In carrying out these responsibilities the commission will exercise its functions under both primary and secondary legislation as well as EU regulation.</P>
      <P>The aviation sector has played an important part in the Irish economy, primarily by supporting growth and commerce in many vital areas of industry. Being an island nation on the periphery of Europe can provide opportunities in some areas but it also provides challenges for transport. The Government must, therefore, ensure it is doing all it can to respond to the demands facing the providers of air transport and also those bodies which provide the essential infrastructure and services to the transport providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time, there has been a considerable amount of public debate on the issue of airport charges and some very diverse views are evident. The airlines, as one would expect, are anxious to have charges as low as practicable to drive growth in their business. From the viewpoint of Aer Rianta, there has been no increase to the tariffs since about 1987. It was interesting to note that the UK assistant permanent secretary on transport who was over at the Institute of European <Col N="668" /> Affairs told me our charges are far lower than in the UK and in many of the European countries. He cannot understand the fuss created here about charges.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons Aer Rianta was in a position to offer discounted rates was the steady and healthy stream of revenues coming from duty free sales. We know what happened in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister lost that and it was her own making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did. Given that it had been decided to provide for independent regulation from this year on, Aer Rianta announced that it would roll on the discount scheme to the end of 1999, thereby allowing a further six months of discounted rates to the airlines. The shortfall in revenues arising from the loss of duty free together with a major requirement for capital expenditure presented a very critical issue, which pushed the issue of the appropriate level of charges to the forefront of the debate. Aer Rianta was of the view that a fresh appraisal of the structure and basis for airport charges was long overdue. Aviation business had changed since the late 1980s with the liberalisation of air travel across Europe, competition and the significant increase in passenger numbers. All those factors combined created a different climate.</P>
      <P>The liberalisation of air services coupled with strong growth has given rise to rapidly growing passenger numbers. Since 1994, total passenger traffic has increased at an annual rate of 12% to 16.5 million passengers in 1999. A programme of investment has been under way since 1997 &ndash; planned by the previous Government in 1995-96 &ndash; and major capacity enhancing projects under this programme at the State airports, particularly Dublin Airport, will be substantially completed, at a cost of £350 million by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>A policy response had to be made to the situation which had emerged, not only as a result of duty free losses but also as a result of the changing face of the air transport market. The solution lay in a fresh independent examination of airport charges and the creation of a new regime. In looking at the position, it became clear that the central issue was the potential for conflict between the shareholder role and the regulatory role. The difficulties of having the two roles merged in one entity has been highlighted in many decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard that old story before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the decision that the best way to resolve this issue was to do just that so that we could pave the way for a full and unfettered analysis of the core issue. I then put to Government my proposals for an independent economic regulator. There are many who will argue, such as Deputy Stagg, that the Government is wrong to hive off its regulatory function and that it should instead divest itself of its share<Col N="669" /> holder's role. This issue was a feature of the Second Stage debate in the Seanad where I made some comments. Irrespective of the final outcome of the whole Aer Rianta semi-official debate, the matter of the regulator stands on its own merits.</P>
      <P>The issue of the shareholder interest is a critical one and must be considered carefully. As it now stands, the people of Ireland, through the relevant Ministers, own the State airports which are an important asset. The regulatory issue, on the other hand, was in a different category but it carried with it other issues of concern, primarily that of creating the right framework. I share the concerns some people have in relation to giving over huge segments of public activity to newly formed independent agencies. If we were merely to transfer power as happened under the Telecommunications Act, 1996, without accountability, clearly there would be a democratic deficit. Even though we were obliged at European Community level to establish regulatory agencies in the telecommunications and electricity sectors, it is essential that we also provide sufficiently robust redress and balance. I saw a big article in <i>The Phoenix</i> that I am out to do Etain Doyle. That is far from the case, I am not out to do her.</P>

      <P>I just saw the article in <i>The Phoenix.</i> It was for that reason that I invited public comment last year on a range of issues in the area of governance and accountability. They poked fun at my document and called it a dreary document. I will have to tell Andy Cullen about that and I hope he reads it. This invitation prompted a wide-ranging discussion of what should be best practice in the regulatory process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very appreciative of the level of the response and of the valuable comments received. The exercise resulted in the publication of a comprehensive set of policy proposals, a copy of which was made available to Members.</P>
      <P>As this is the first legislation establishing an independent regulatory office since the publication of those policy proposals, I have included in the Bill some of the recommendations from the proposal process, such as issues of transparency, independence and accountability. I hope these policy proposals will set a blueprint for other future regulatory bodies and will be the cornerstone of ensuring public confidence in the independence and fairness of their operations. The remaining area on the charges front, which we have added to the regulator's brief is the determination of a cap for certain air traffic control charges, particularly those that are imposed by the IAA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the remaining areas in the Bill, these flow from the existing regulatory functions traditionally dealt with by my Department. We <Col N="670" /> have assigned to the regulator all the relevant aspects from an economic perspective, of the chain of events in which the carriers are involved, stretching from the licensing stage through to the allocation of departure and arrival slots and up to the regulation of ground handling and the determination of landing charges.</P>
    <P>Regulation is, to a great extent, a balancing act, one which seeks to address the interests of the parties being regulated and the rights and requirements of the users of the services supplied by those parties. In terms of the State airport authority, Aer Rianta, we have sought to provide that regulation takes into account the various aspects of its role and function. The commission will have regard to the necessary levels of investment in airport infrastructure, the requirement of sustainable and profitable airports and the level of Aer Rianta's operating costs and expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the Deputy's behaviour. This will be an important part of the analysis conducted by the commission prior to deciding on the charges cap.</P>
      <P>In relation to the commission's role on air traffic control charges, we have introduced measures in the Bill which will balance the competing interests of the service provider, the IAA and its client base, the airlines. As I said, regulation is a balancing act. The framework for which I have opted combines the relevant measures thereby allowing regulation to take place on the middle ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill which outline the regulatory objectives reflect the policy concepts in my Department's strategy statement &ndash; I wonder if Deputy Stagg remembers that &ndash; and provide a sound economic and regulatory framework within which the commission will work. In framing the legislation and in line with the requirements for introducing new statutory measures, my Department consulted all interested parties and relevant Government Departments. The Bill is framed to provide the commission with the necessary level of flexibility and discretion and this approach will be open and transparent. As I said in the Seanad, independence and accountability are very much two sides of the same coin. It is important for the development of the market that there is confidence in the regulatory process. However, it is not acceptable for a Minister to hand over all responsibility and then step back. <Col N="671" /> The rules of democracy dictate that there should be accountability.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. Part I, sections 1 to 4, relates to the short title, interpretations and the establishment day. Part II, sections 5 to 7, provides for the independence and functions of the commission. Sections 8 to 9 assign the four other functions. Section 10 provides for ministerial authority to issue policy directions of a general nature. One of the main suggestions proffered by all parties in the Seanad was the inclusion of a regional dimension which has been included in this section. Section 11 provides for the appointment of the members of the commission. Sections 12 and 13 provide for the recruitment of staff by the commission and the appointment of a deputy commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 14 empowers the commission to engage consultants if it requires these services. Section 15 addresses the issue of ethical behaviour and controls on staff interests. Section 16 outlines the usual prohibition in respect of election at local, national or European level, on a member of the commission. Sections 17 and 18 place a requirement on both members of the commission and staff or consultants employed by the commission to make an initial declaration as to their interests and to make ongoing disclosures of interests as appropriate. Section 19 provides for the standard penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of information. Sections 20 and 21 allow for the creation of superannuation schemes. Sections 22 to 25 provides for the resources and revenues of the commission. It is intended to assign staff from my Department to carry out the functions being transferred. These officers will remain staff of my Department and will be replaced and reassigned in the usual manner. This arrangement ensures the continuity of staff experience, something which is vital in the start-up phase of a new office.</P>
    <P>The main provision in relation to funding is the commission's power to impose a levy on the regulated entities, subject to the obligation to set the levy at an amount, which only secures the operational costs and expenses of the office. Section 26 deals with the reporting measures in terms of financial accounts  &ndash; the format of these are to be agreed with my Department and the Department of Finance and they will be subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General on an annual basis. The accounts and the auditor's report will be laid before the Houses. Section 27 places a requirement on the commission to report to the Minister whenever requested to do so and to report to the relevant Oireachtas committee. Section 28 empowers the commission to require the separation of accounts. Section 29 gives scope to the commission to deal directly with its requirements for office premises. Section 30 provides that the commission shall have a seal which shall be used to authenticate its official documents.</P>
    <P>Part III, section 31, outlines the scope of the regulation which will apply to airports having <Col N="672" /> more than one million passengers annually, that is, the three State airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon. This may be varied by ministerial order. Section 32 outlines the nature and scope of the regulator's role and the framework in which a determination is made. Section 33 outlines the regulatory objectives which will be addressed by the commission prior to making a determination on airport charges. Section 34 amends the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, by substituting the commission for the Minister as the approving body for the charges levied by the airport authority. Section 35 deals with the regulation of aviation terminal services charges. These are the charges for air navigation services provided by the IAA. Section 36, similarly to section 33, sets out the broad policy framework in which the commission will carry out its functions regarding a determination on the air traffic charges. We have sought to balance the respective requirements of the IAA and its customers. Safety will continue to play the lead role in all of those activities.</P>
    <P>Section 39 is an enforcement procedure. Section 40 is a standard procedure outlining the methods by which a notice may be served on interested parties. Section 41 governs the role and powers of authorised officers and section 42 empowers them to procure a search warrant in carrying out their duties. Section 43 provides the standard indemnification in relation to the <i>bona fide</i> performance of his or her duties by a member of staff. Section 44 provides that in line with company law requirements, in the case of an offence committed by a body corporate with the knowledge and consent of a director or officer of that body, the individual concerned as well as the company, shall be regarded as having committed the offence. Section 45 provides that in line with usual practice, summary offences are prosecutable by the commission. Section 46 seeks to amend the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, to facilitate any future decision regarding the use of military aerodromes for civil aviation purposes.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello put down an amendment which I said I would consider here. The amendment will give jurisdiction to the Irish Aviation Authority in relation to civil aviation matters. Section 47 provides that the commission will be subject to the freedom of information legislation. Section 48 amends a typographical error in the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998. Section 49 amends the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I hope we will make some inroads in the short time available. I understand time has been allocated for further debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time. Like Deputy Stagg, I welcome <Col N="673" /> section 46 of the Bill which provides for the removal of the statutory impediment which, under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, prevented the use of military aerodromes for commercial or civil purposes.  This has a direct bearing on my constituency of Dublin South-West, which is a large expanding conurbation with large levels of investment in industrial estates, but it also affects the surrounding counties of Kildare and Wicklow. A second airport sited at Baldonnel would be of great benefit to this city. I appreciate the two Ministers involved, Deputies O'Rourke and Michael Smith, have to look at the hard proposals behind the opening up of Baldonnel for civil use. However, I am glad this section enables that to happen. I look forward to the debate on this.</P>
      <P>The reasons for opening up Baldonnel are fairly clear. A large number of smaller aircraft, including executive jets, are taking up unnecessary runway space at Dublin Airport. From a practical point of view, it would be helpful if these could be moved to Baldonnel. Baldonnel could develop, at least initially, as a location for commercial executive jet travel, which is a growing area in the aviation industry. Many companies prefer to charter their own executive jets, which allows them to transport their executives abroad and back in the same day, making large savings in terms of overnight expenses etc. Baldonnel is an ideal hub location for the early development of this type of business. This is the right way for the Government to go. We must also, in the long-term, look to the development of Baldonnel as a second airport for the large Dublin conurbation and the surrounding counties.</P>
      <P>The opening up of Baldonnel would have a huge impact on the area I represent. Tallaght and Clondalkin have had difficulties historically with high levels of unemployment, crime and disadvantage. They also, paradoxically, have a high presence of high quality industrial estates in the Citywest and Parkwest business parks. Those two key employers are examples of the modern, developed industrial estates of the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is getting all the credit for that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These industrial business parks are the way of the future. The Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has made a significant contribution to the development of Citywest as a hub for e-commerce, which is an important and growing part of Irish industrial life. It is only a matter of time before we need an airport to service both those industrial estates. Citywest will employ 12,000 people in the medium term and similar figures are being spoken about for Parkwest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a major hospital, institute of technology and the headquarters of South Dublin County Council in the south-west corner of the <Col N="674" /> city. All this points to the development and opening up of Baldonnel as a serious resource for that portion of the city, which would also relieve the very obvious congestion at Dublin Airport. One does not need to be an airline traveller to know of the massive congestion at Dublin Airport. I note the Minister is committed to providing resources, including finance, so that Dublin Airport can meet its capacity difficulties. However, in the long run, we can develop two airports in Dublin. Most European cities have two airports, although this would be closer to a one and a half airport system. If the private sector is willing to invest in a second airport, it should be allowed get on with it.</P>
    <P>Section 46, and the wider developments in the aviation industry, make this a very exciting time. One could be envious of the Minister for having such an opportunity to develop this industry along the lines of what happened to telecommunications under her tutelage. Legislation is going through the House for the potentially very exciting offer to the public of Aer Lingus. Later, there will be the question of whether Aer Rianta will be the subject of a public offering of shares. The Minister has been criticised for the manner in which she sells shares but&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No, just the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Hassle&rdquo; might be a better word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>She will get the best price for the taxpayer, which is our requirement in this House. We are not here to underwrite speculative share investments, thankfully.</P>
      <P>I have two views on Aer Rianta, of which I hope the Minister will take note. I am not universally or ideologically committed to the IPO, or public share offering, route. I know it has benefits in terms of retaining investment in Ireland and among ordinary shareholders or investors. However, depending on market conditions, it might be worth considering the alternative of selling Aer Rianta by tender. This has been done before. Some leading business people in Ireland have bought airports abroad. A number of large merchant banks, such as Merrill Lynch, invest in large utilities. They try to maximise the return on the asset and, down the road, may consider offering that asset in an IPO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is keen on offering shares, but there is the separate route of simply trying to get the highest price available when the international merchant banks see what kind of return they could get from the asset. That is a possible alternative route for Aer Rianta, although another share offering would be good for the development of our capital markets. These matters must be carefully judged in the context of <Col N="675" /> when the last offer was made and if money is available to invest in another.</P>
    <P>This is a great enabling Bill. It introduces the idea of a regulator for this industry. As the Minister outlined, there have been huge vexed issues in relation to the landing charges in Irish airports. There have been unseemly disputes between the different carriers and operators, Ryanair and Aer Rianta. These long-lasting disputes have not been helpful in terms of the development of this industry. Everybody is interested in reducing the charges. Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair presses that case very strongly. This is an important Bill which removes the Minister and the Department from the decision-making process on the level of the charges and whether they are suitable. This is a massive step forward. The regulator has already been appointed and I presume the Bill provides for the detail required to run an office of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has avoided some of the pitfalls in the telecommunications legislation, on which I presume this is modelled, where, for some reason, it was not deemed necessary to have the regulator accountable to this House. I understand the Minister is introducing legislation that will require the regulator to appear before Oireachtas committees and account for himself or herself. That is how it should be. If we are introducing a system of regulators who are at one remove to regulate important industries, it is important to have political accountability and that we, the elected tribunes of the people, have an opportunity to tease out the detail of policy issues and the way these offices work, so that anything wrong in these offices can be seen in the plain light of day and they will have to defend themselves before Parliament.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are very interesting. The provisions in relation to codes of conduct and the disclosure of interests by the commissioners and staff of the regulator's office will go a long way towards ensuring confidence in the probity and transparency of the new office. Section 33 deals with the policy objectives to be used by the commission in determining airport charges. This must be welcomed by everybody in the industry, as it will create a level playing field, in terms of disclosure of financial and economic information to underpin the setting of fair and equitable charges. I am glad there are serious regulations in the Bill in relation to the wrongful disclosure by that office of commercially sensitive information. This is vital if the industry is to have confidence in an operation of this nature. It is also important in the context of the House's planned consideration of whistleblower legislation. That will have a role where there is bad practice in the sector. The regulator will also be important in that regard and the Minister has provided for that. It may even be helpful with regard to how these offices are run if we opt for whistleblower legislation for the business and industry sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> The interesting modern phenomenon of air rage is being dealt with. The Minister provides for a stiffer regime of penalties and fines for people who misbehave or commit misdemeanours, crimes or offences on aircraft. This is a healthy development. People who travel on aircraft are irritated by long delays due to a truculent passenger being awkward, even drunk, and causing huge problems for everybody. This legislation will allow the gardaí to board an airplane without a warrant and to remove the offender. That was a huge practical problem.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to Baldonnel. I appeal to her and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, to move fast on the matter and to open the airport to executive jets. There is a real priority here for speed and to move development further and I am aware that the Minister for Public Enterprise likes to get things done quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to establish a regulator to deal with the economic aspects of airports. Before I discuss those and the issue of regulation, I am anxious to press a matter which was not dealt with in the Seanad debate but which is separate, specific and important.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from IALPA &ndash; the Irish Airline Pilots Association &ndash; about safety issues. Deputy Lenihan also referred to them. I will put three points to the Minister which demonstrate serious gaps in the law. Nobody disputes the need to deal with these problems. The first problem is that it is not an offence to smoke on board an airplane, although most airlines direct passengers not to smoke. Under Statutory Instrument 62 of 1986, the carrier should take all reasonable steps to ensure that smoking is prohibited. However, it is not an offence. People will go into the toilet to smoke. They generally remove the battery of the smoke detector or disable the smoke alarm. They might then throw the lit cigarette into the bin which can cause a fire. Of course, the smoke detector cannot work and a frightening scenario can result.</P>
      <P>It is reported to me that cabin crew on board a flight have faced the problem of having a fire on board. There is a mandatory procedure in aviation whereby a mayday call must be made. That sets in motion a substantial ground and air response to deal with the emergency. I appeal to the Minister &ndash; I intend to put down a relevant amendment &ndash; to make it an offence to smoke aboard an aircraft when the no smoking sign is illuminated. A person who has smoked aboard an aircraft and, having been requested by a member of the crew to stop, continues to smoke should be guilty of an offence which would carry a fine of £2,500. A person who smokes in a compartment of the craft and damages the safety equipment components should also be guilty of an offence and subject to a fine of £2,500. This is not a theoretical problem; there have been such occurrences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second problem is disruptive passengers. I understand the Department has received corre<Col N="677" /> spondence on this. There is a statutory instrument &ndash; Statutory Instrument 98 of 1998, in this regard but it has been put to me that it not quite clear to the Department how serious a problem a disruptive passenger can be. In the last six weeks there have been three attempts in Europe and the USA by disruptive passengers to enter the cockpit, overpower the pilot and cause the aircraft to crash. If this occurred on an airbus with over 300 people on board, given the kerosene fuel and the laden weight, it would be horrific.</P>
    <P>The original fines were linked to public order offences. However, this is a new order of offences. An aircraft cabin is unique in the cost of diversion alone. The pilots are asking that the fines be increased to £5,000 from the present level of £500 and £700 and that the offence carry a prison term not exceeding five years or both. The carrier should also be able to seek to recover the cost of diversion caused by such a person. There was a case in Shannon recently where two men caused huge disruption. They were detained in the Garda barracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of flying them home was horrendous. The carrier refused to bring them back because they were so disruptive. Another airplane had to be hired to return them. The fines must be greatly increased.</P>
      <P>The third problem is interference with flight crew. The current situation is unbelievable. A member of the crew must personally press charges if they have been interfered with or assaulted by a passenger. Two weeks ago, two cabin crew were sexually assaulted on a flight to Los Angeles. The passenger was released to the local police force and escorted to his next flight because the local police were unsure of the jurisdiction. The cabin crew are particularly vulnerable. They deal with emergencies and many other difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister should examine section 59(a) of the UK Navigation Act, 1999. It recognises the cabin crew's special role in aircraft safety and it should be adopted into Irish law. It would provide that no person while in an aircraft could use threatening, abusive or insulting words towards a member of the crew, behave in a threatening fashion or intentionally interfere with the performance of a member of the crew and that any person guilty of such an offence would be fined £5,000.</P>
      <P>These are three specific proposals for the Minister. The main body of my contribution will deal with the economic aspects of regulation but because this list of problems is specific and finite, I urge the Minister to examine section 49 of the Bill and see how it can be amended to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill. Last year we were knee deep in consultants' reports commissioned by Ryanair and Aer Rianta which claimed,<i> inter alia</i>, that charges were too high, too low, uncompetitive <Col N="678" /> and competitive. Everybody who hired a consultant got the consultant to reinforce their argument. I called for the establishment of an independent regulator because there was an obvious conflict where the Minister owned Aer Rianta, a monopolist airport, and at the same time acted as regulator. This legislation seeks to resolve that dilemma by moving the regulatory role to the independent aviation regulator. I support the Bill in terms of what it sets out to achieve. It is in line with what has been happening in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors.</P>
    <P>I have met the regulator designate, Mr. Prasifka. I was highly impressed with him, his ability, affability, approach and his experience of anti-trust law in the US. Apparently he got his previous job in the Competition Authority because he was the most frequent person to appear before it as a legal representative with a legal firm in Dublin.  I believe he is fair minded, able and intelligent to deal with the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's reference to Mr. David Holmes. Unfortunately, I could not attend the round table Institute of European Affairs meeting but I received a copy of what he said. It is instructive some 13 years later to look at what happened in the UK. Having read his paper, there are lessons we can learn from the experience of the British Government in relation to the privatisation of BAA and the independent establishment of CAA. The 1985 White Paper stated that traffic charges and airports charges decreased by 50% and that these now represent 30% as opposed to 70% of total airport charges. Although we have a different scale of population and our geography is different, we can learn from the British experience.</P>
    <P>In relation to Aer Rianta and the regulator, he said this should be kept as a single entity. It is very important for the future of Aer Rianta that it be retained as a single entity. He also said that one of the key failures was to put in place adequate incentives for the airport. In other words, there is a constant conflict between investing in new capacity and obtaining profits from existing capacity. The successful airports that developed as a hub were those which were ahead of the posse in terms of building extra capacity, not just catching up with the growth in traffic. Therefore, if as a national objective we want to develop a hub in Dublin, that must be a key criterion.</P>
    <P>The price cap formula set out &ndash; the retail price index minus X% &ndash; is interesting. I will return to the relevant section. Section 33 sets out the criteria which apply, which is, &ldquo;Whatever you are having yourself&rdquo;, so to speak. Mr. Prasifka said that he wants four main issues included. The UK formula might be considered for the first period. Mr. Holmes referred to building incentives to take risks. We could consider allowing Aer Rianta to build a rail link to the airport &ndash; given that so many transport projects are needed in this city that it should not be prohibited from doing so. This could be done by way of a joint venture, <Col N="679" /> perhaps. He said that only traffic charges were being addressed in the legislation. Perhaps other charges within the confines of the airport could also be looked at.</P>
    <P>There was a role for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in the UK but there is no comparable role for the Competition Authority here. Mr. Prasifka's background is the Competition Authority so perhaps that problem is overcome. However, it is worth making the point. There is proposed regulation of service quality. At the end of the day we are all here to serve the consumer and if he or she wishes to get in or out of the airport the question is whether there should be a service quality provision. There is no customer service provision included, just economic regulation.</P>
    <P>There is no objective to develop a hub for Dublin or Shannon. The key objective seems to be to generate sufficient capacity in advance of it happening, as opposed to playing a game of catch up. I thought Mr. Holmes's insight, notwithstanding any philosophical difference between Ireland and the UK, was instructive in terms of how we should approach this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by the paper which seemed very fair minded.</P>
      <P>This leads me to another issue &ndash; the lessons we must learn from the existing establishment of both the ODTR and the CER in the telecommunications and energy fields. Deputy Conor Lenihan referred to the need for proper accountability. In that regard Mr. Prasifka impressed on me that he was very anxious the Bill would not be changed very much. He said the nature of the political process is that Aer Rianta and its employees will lobby their local Deputies and that one could set the goal posts so as to be very favourable to Aer Rianta's profits rather than to consumer considerations. His main point was that he was happy with the Bill as it was.</P>
      <P>With wireless local loop and the third mobile licence, the ODTR has become a first stop before the courts. There is no appeal mechanism in the original Bill and, therefore, Mr. Prasifka was anxious to keep section 38 so that the judicial review would be about points of law as opposed to a point of appeal. I am anxious to strike a balance to allow fair play, so that a dictator will not emerge while at the same time matters should not get bogged down in the courts. We should consider section 38 in some detail. There must be proper accountability to the committee or another structure. The budget in the first few years will be very important to allow for the hiring of adequate expertise and consultancies. The learning curve is at its steepest in the first few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of Aer Rianta's future. I was very interested when the Minister stated in her speech, having received the Warburg <Col N="680" /> Dillon report, &ldquo;I am continuing to give very careful consideration to the findings in that report and will be formulating my own views on what is the best choice of option for the company.&rdquo;  According to the<i> Irish Examiner</i> the dogs in the street know that the Minister has dropped this ball and been rebuffed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and a number of other Ministers who have a personal interest in their own pet airport. I am interested that she is continuing to give it careful consideration. At the end of the day, that must be a finite process and I have tabled a series of Dáil questions on the issue. This issue was put off for months and now it has gone into the ether. Perhaps her successor will have to deal with the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, it is a Cabinet decision. I am of the view that airports are as much part of the nation's infrastructure as seaports or roads. It is not the family silver, it is the kitchen back door. I am in favour of the three principal airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, being part of our State infrastructure and the public programme. It is fine if the Minister wishes to privatise Aer Rianta International, because that is commercial, but the airports are different.</P>
      <P>In relation to regional policy and national access transport policy, we are an island nation and some future Government may decide to promote tourism or whatever else through our airport policy. Therefore, we should retain the core business of the airports in State ownership. They should be financed properly, in a fair manner and fully funded. This is totally against what the management of Aer Rianta wants. When I met with them, they were very disappointed with my attitude but I told them straight where I stood on the issue.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport is a licence to print money and there is no comparison with Baldonnel. All the carriers, apart from the executive jets, want to use Dublin Airport. Potentially, this may mean 40 million passengers in the future. The accounts published last year amounted to £40 million and this will be very profitable, regardless of the Celtic tiger. The profits of Dublin Airport should be used to develop Cork and Shannon. Once one goes down the partial privatisation route, one cannot be a little bit pregnant, so to speak. It is a question of earnings per share, whether we invest in Dusseldorf, Birmingham, Cork or Shannon, and which will give the best return. This is how a public company operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy Permanent Secretary, who was present last week, said that their airports have been fully privatised for 13 years. Aberdeen, Prestwick and others are loss making and the shareholders never sought&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="681" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, if one takes London, there is a difference between Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow &ndash; Heathrow is first. However, there is a difference between that and Dublin where there is only one airport. Therefore, whatever competitive arguments arise in the UK of competition between airports, the truth is that it is two and a half to three hours drive from Cork to Shannon. Dublin Airport is a monopoly and it is better that it is a public rather than a private monopoly. It is a public utility, while Eircom and even Aer Lingus are competing as trading entities.</P>
      <P>The suggestion is for a 30% IPO. If the position in principle is that the State will not invest more money, the 30% will increase as it will need more equity in the future. Therefore, the argument about 30% does not address the point. Aer Rianta International can take on the world, but a public capital programme will ensure our specific requirements concerning the national interest and is in the best interest of the mid-west, Cork, etc. That does not mean we cannot cut costs in Aer Rianta or that it cannot be run better. Neither does it mean we cannot do more in terms of promotion and marketing &ndash; I am not saying everything is rosy &ndash; but if earnings per share is the mantra it will become very difficult.</P>
      <P>Ryanair has lobbied me on different points concerning section 33. They want criteria inserted, including the criteria of lowest possible cost in respect of charges and the promotion and development of traffic in Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. I have also been lobbied by Aer Rianta on issues which I will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A point I have raised on a number of occasions with the Minister is ground handling. I know the ground handling directive deals with the economic aspect of baggage handling. I am sure the Minister will make improvements to amendments I propose, based on the advice of the Attorney General and others, but I am seeking to amend the articles of association of the IAA to include in its remit and mandate a responsibility to ensure proper safety in all aspects of the operation of those licensed under the ground handling directive. My particular concern is before an aircraft takes off, when safety is the responsibility of the carrier, and while it is on the ground. The way luggage is professionally loaded on to an aircraft is a safety issue which the IAA says is beyond its scope and is a matter for the carrier while the carrier says it is not its responsibility. Who will carry the can if there is a problem with a charter company which is not based in Ireland? It also relates to various aspects of maintenance, fuelling, etc. I will propose a new section providing for the Minister to order the IAA to take responsibility and a new section 37 which will amend the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. I will return to this, but the arguments have been well rehearsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the debate in the Seanad an amendment was brought forward providing that <Col N="682" /> the regulations in section 46 would not come into effect earlier than one month prior to the commencement of civil aviation operations. The issue here relates to the concern of the FAI in terms of the new stadium, etc. I have not studied this in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that on the day an international survey reported that 25% of adults are functionally illiterate and another 20% can perform only simple reading and writing tasks I have to address the House on the issue of teacher cut backs in St. Brigid's Primary School, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. Is the Minister for Education and Science blind? Does he not see the very clear link between teacher cut backs and adult literacy problems? Does he understand that improved teacher pupil ratios are fundamental to improving the quality of education? Can he sympathise in any way with the parents who have discovered that Mrs. Carmel Hughes, a teacher who is about to retire, will not be replaced? Her teaching post will be lost from 31 August because the numbers on the school roll were 237 on 30 September 1999, three short of the number necessary for the retention of a ninth assistant.</P>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that the loss of one teacher will cause havoc in the school which is in a disadvantaged area. One should not be fooled by the Dublin 4 address &ndash; I have always said there is Dublin 4 and Dublin 4B, and many of these children are drawn not from Dublin 4 but from the inner city and Dublin 2. Many are from Ringsend where I live. I know the school and the adjacent school, St. Mary's, very well. The loss of one teacher will continue the cycle of disadvantage. Classes will have to double up and some will even breach the maximum figure of 29 set down for disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents and staff are very upset and cannot understand the petty bureaucracy which allows such a situation. The Government boasts of economic growth and prosperity, of huge trade surpluses and tax revenues, and yet ignores the most fundamental needs in society, namely, housing, health and education. The Government has not really grasped the fact that it is useless having money unless it is spent wisely and benefits ordinary people and future generations. The Government does not understand that to maintain pros<Col N="683" /> perity and improve quality of life, investment in education is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not want any further excuses. If the guidelines have given rise to this situation then we must change them. I note the guidelines for Gaelscoileanna are far more liberal, and while I support the promotion of Irish I also support similar standards for children in my area, which is disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the Minister on a previous occasion for a remedial teacher. The school has many disadvantages and I hope the Minister listens to me. In the past the school has not had a resource teacher or psychological service nor a Department funded secretary or care-taker. It does not have a hall or all-purpose room. It rents the parish hall once per week when it is not being used by people from the parish. It does not have a computer room or parent meeting room. I have previously raised all these problems in the House and I will not go back over old ground. However, I ask the Minister to please listen to the pleas of the parents, staff and local representatives so we can make progress.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of the survey I quoted which strongly emphasised the link between illiteracy and unemployment. The Minister can make a difference to the aspirations of the children in my area to go to third level and find good employment, aspirations we should all have, by providing a replacement for the teacher who will retire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Deputy on the staffing position in St. Brigid's national school, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of St. Brigid's national school is a principal and nine mainstream teachers based on an enrolment of 241 pupils on 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of a concessionary teacher due to its disadvantaged status, a shared resource teacher and a shared home-school liaison teacher, both of whom are based in the school.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 237 pupils. As the figure for the retention of the ninth teacher is 240, unfortunately the school must lose a post. I understand the teacher who held this post is being retained in the school in replacement of the teacher who is retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board of management is of the view that the enrolment of the school in September 2000 will increase substantially, it may apply for a post under the developing school criteria, which for the 2000-01 school year are outlined in circular <Col N="684" /> letter 11/2000, a copy of which was forwarded to the board recently. To satisfy the criteria outlined, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 1999. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 262 pupils on 30 September 2000 to gain a post. If the board of management is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September will be in excess of 262 pupils, it should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department for the allocation of a teaching post under the developing school criteria.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in the number of teachers provided. The Government has to distribute the enormous extra resources provided equitably. This is done in conjunction with school managements and the INTO. They devise a formula which is applied by us. There are certain clauses such as the one mentioned of which schools can avail. Others will be introduced soon to tackle disadvantage. I regret that I cannot be of more help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue which is of great importance to the people of Pallaskenry, County Limerick, where there is a need to construct extra classrooms and toilets as well as a cloakroom and store in the local national school. As the proposal has been with the Department for five years the issue should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Pupils are being catered for in two classrooms in prefabricated buildings which are totally unsuitable and in which a remedial teacher also works. They have been in use in the school for 14 years and prior to that for a further eight years. It is unacceptable to allow children to be educated in such buildings which everyone accepts are unsuitable. It is also unfair on teachers who cannot work properly in such conditions. While moneys were made available in 1997 to improve the buildings they are still totally unsuitable. The external walls are rotting, there is dry rot in the classrooms and the buildings are cold in winter and warm in summer. In warm weather classes are obliged to move outdoors because of the intense heat. There is no insulation and no toilet. As a consequence pupils are obliged to cross the main schoolyard, which creates enormous difficulties in wet weather. Pupils must cross from the permanent structure to the prefabricated buildings in similar conditions for remedial teaching. I am sure the Minister will agree that this is also unsatisfactory. The current staffing of the school is a principal and seven assistant teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the board of management wrote to the Department seeking approval for the replacement of the prefabricated buildings. A full review of enrolment trends was undertaken by the <Col N="685" /> planning section following which it was considered that the school's medium to long-term accommodation requirements were six permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation. In August 1996 the Department informed the board of management that it considered that the provision of an additional classroom, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation would satisfy its needs.</P>
    <P>Pallaskenry is a satellite town. Its population has quadrupled in the past 20 years and will continue to increase as there are proposals to provide a sewerage scheme which will lead to enormous housing development and as a consequence a big demand for educational facilities. Council housing estates have been built in addition to developments initiated by Aughinish Alumina. There have also been private developments. It is an attractive town into which many more families will move for the reasons mentioned.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to the teachers for continuing to work in such unsatisfactory conditions and parents for their tolerance. Demonstrations often take place outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. The people of Pallaskenry will not do this, they will protest in a quiet and dignified fashion in an effort to have the school completed.</P>
    <P>A sum of £20,000 was spent on the prefabricated buildings in October 1997. The Minister's officials in Tullamore gave me a guarantee at the time that if this was accepted by the board of management and parents it would not interfere in any way with the construction of the new classrooms required.</P>
    <P>The parochial house adjacent to the school is now up for sale and, if required, a strip of land can be made available to the Department for the proposed extension. The Minister's officials should advise the board of management if this would be of assistance. I understand the church authorities would be sympathetic to such a request.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Pallaskenry National School. At present, the school has a staffing level of principal, five assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The school's facilities consist of four permanent classrooms, a general-purpose room currently being used as a classroom and a three classroom prefabricated block.</P>
      <P>An application has been received in my Department from the management authorities of the school seeking grant assistance towards replacing the prefabricated structure with a permanent facility. A technical inspection of the school building was carried out recently and a report is currently being prepared. When it has been fully considered, my Department's building unit will be in contact with the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a very large number of schools building projects on <Col N="686" /> hand within my Department. In view of the priority which the Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending Estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fund-raising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by the management authorities of Pallaskenry National School will be dealt with as speedily as possible. I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House. I appreciate the points he has made. Once we receive the report I will try to have it progressed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's capabilities, but I wish to make a point. I thank him for attending the House at this late hour in view of the by-election campaign in Tipperary South.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to announce the date when new grant aid will be available for farm waste management and dairy hygiene purposes. We have once again experienced a period of very difficult weather conditions for the harvesting of grass tillage. I do not hold the Minister responsible for that.</P>
      <P>However, it reminds us once again of the need for ample storage for silage effluent and farm waste in general. Any young farmer involved in the REP scheme who has the misfortune to have a pollution problem and appear before a court would not only have to pay the obligatory fine and expenses, but would also lose his place in REPS and have to repay any money he had already collected. This is a possible cost of up to £25,000 plus to a young farmer. Compare that to the treatment of senior personnel at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the matter of cross-compliance and the possible loss of headage, premia, suckler cow and sheep headage payments, etc. How much more can farmers take? I canvassed in parts of Tipperary South last weekend and it brought home to me again how many young people are no longer looking at agriculture as an option. Quite large dairy farms are being closed down. Young people are no longer prepared to put up <Col N="687" /> with this situation. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development accepted a report which projected that only 20,000 full-time farmers would be in business by 2010. Given the performance of the Government, we will reach that very quickly.</P>
    <P>Some £37 million was provided for the control of farmyard pollution in 1996, £47 million in 1997, £10 million in 1999 and less than £2 million for the first four months of this year. No REPS is available at present unless one is already part of the scheme and no farm retirement scheme is available. Europe is being blamed for everything, including all the delays. The Minister and the Government must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>The proposed 40% grant aid and a further 6% for trained young farmers is welcome and is something to look forward to. However, even if the scheme was announced now, there would be further delays with planning and farm management reports, etc. Some say it may be October or next year before the scheme is delivered. The onus is on the Minster and his senior civil servants to ensure it is delivered quickly.</P>
    <P>Banks will not give loans until grants are guaranteed. With their low income over the last few years, farmers cannot afford to continue without grants. There has been a 40% drop in the numbers of young people attending agriculture college. This must have serious implications for the future of our biggest industry. St. Patrick's college in my county &ndash; and yours, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle &ndash; was closed this year. We do not want to see that repeated around the country.</P>
    <P>In my own area, which is not as yet severely handicapped, there is still a problem because there is no headage available. Payments and grants such as this are more important than ever. I know that bureaucrats in Brussels can be difficult. However, the fact that the Government is prepared to pay this level of grant aid to farmers from the sizeable revenue available to it means that Brussels can be dealt with, but it must be dealt with in a progressive and urgent manner. I beg the Minister to get this dealt with as a matter of urgency so that more young farmers will not go out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue. The current position is that grant aid is available for on-farm investments by farmers under the national schemes which were introduced by the Minister last year for the control of farm pollution and improvement of dairy hygiene standards. Some 5,500 farmers have already been approved under these schemes and they will remain open to new applicants until the measures provided in the National Development Plan 2000-06 come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers approved under the national schemes will, over the summer months and beyond, continue with construction works and receive grant aid payments as the works are completed. Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, the <Col N="688" /> Minister has made provision for a farm waste management scheme and a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards. A significant level of funding, amounting to some £217 million, has been allocated for both measures.</P>
    <P>These on-farm investment measures will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. Clearance to proceed requires the approval of the EU Commission. The broad clearance procedure is already well under way as negotiations with the EU Commission on the community support framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been completed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the various operational programmes required have recently been finalised and submitted to the Commission within a tight timeframe. The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow. The Deputy may be aware that there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. By definition, and having regard to the very significant financial proposals for the spending of both EU and Exchequer moneys in the period to 2006, the procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the timeframes associated with clearance of past operational programmes, the process is likely to continue over a number of months. Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate at this stage when any of the schemes involved will commence. We are very much in the hands of the Commission on this, but the Deputy can be assured that the Minister will be doing all he can to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In any event, while the EU Commission procedure is in train, work on preparing the operational parameters of the schemes is proceeding. The Minister is aware that notwithstanding the very significant on-farm investment which has taken place in recent years, there is a considerable way to go and there are many farms which require such investment. It is his intention that the proposed schemes should be available to the greatest number of farmers possible and that in drafting the conditions to be met, full account will be taken of the increasing trend of part-time farming. This is a key aspect arising from the discussions with the social partners during the negotiations for the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The Minister's objective is that the practical aspects of the design of the schemes will be completed so as to coincide with the issue of approval by the Commission which will enable the prompt roll out and commencement of implementation. The Minister is endeavouring to ensure that the new schemes are up and running as early as possible. In the meantime, as I said at the outset, the schemes currently in place will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House recognise that in 2000 there will be no increases in social welfare benefit or social welfare assistance. It is clear that the rates of inflation which the CPI disclosed yesterday show that the increases across the assistance range, from unemployment assistance through to the carer's allowance, survivor's pensions etc., have been wiped out. Indeed, we face the awful prospect of an inflation rate of up to 7% this year and a real decrease in social welfare rates.</P>
      <P>Yesterday when I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on the radio, I thought he displayed a breath-taking arrogance in this regard when he stated that unfortunately while it would be possible to meet the social partners regarding wage rates and a review of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the 1.5 million people dependent completely on social welfare must wait for budget 2001. That means there will be no change until May 2001 or certainly mid-April 2001. Therefore, for the next ten months, with an inflation rate of 5.2%, which is rising, the Minister, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and their colleagues are saying that there will be no further increases whatsoever in social welfare.</P>
      <P>The CPI May figure of 5.2% is certainly bad news for the poorest segments of society. The prospect of inflation of 6% or 7% with an actual decrease in social welfare is a horrendous prospect. It is probably the most serious issue to have been raised today in the House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, indicated that they can go back to the social partners regarding wage rises, but wage rises are averaging 8% or 9% while there is no way in which most assistance schemes will be able to catch up on the inflation rate. The key problem is that in the PPF there is no review mechanism for social welfare and nothing can be done, as the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, told us.</P>
      <P>The poor, in effect, can eat cake. According to the CPI figures, housing costs are rising at 2.2% per month, tobacco at 1.4%, food at 1.3%, drink at 1.2%, transport at 8.3%, fuel and light at 7.1% and services and related expenditure at 6.4% &ndash; that is an appalling figure for anybody who can expect an increase of only 5.2%. Of course the figures are on a year on year basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the senior constituents in Tipperary, where I have spent a significant time over the past few weeks, reminded me that the cost of a sliced pan has risen by 6p or 7p this year. They asked why politicians were placing emphasis on the increase in the price of drink when the price of bread, the most fundamental food, is rising dramatically. As Dr. Michael Smurfit noted a few years ago, the poorest people in society spend a far higher proportion of their income on food and basic services, and the types of food which have <Col N="690" /> been affected by the CPI rises include poultry, fresh fruit and vegetables. In all those areas the Minister can expect that people must change to poorer quality food, and the impact on the poorest in society will be dramatic. Likewise the rising cost of transport will have a major impact on those 1.5 million people.</P>
    <P>Although the House has not been told, two days ago we received information through the <i>Irish Independent</i> regarding the levels of child poverty in society. According to an article in that newspaper, one in six, that is nearly 17%, of Irish children live in poverty and only the UK, Turkey, Italy and Mexico have a worse child poverty rate than Ireland. In that context this year the Minister is not prepared to give any further increases across the range of social welfare schemes. Basically the Minister granted an increase of £4. For example, unemployment assistance rose from £73.50 to £77.50, carer's received £80.50 instead of £76.50, blind pensioners received £77.50 instead of £73.50 etc.</P>
    <P>It seems it is critical that the Minister come into the House with a Finance (No. 2) Bill and a new social welfare Bill. The constituents of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, in Waterford, and my constituents are most dependent on social welfare. We urgently need a new social welfare Bill with adequate increases. The Labour Party asked for an increase of £10 per week and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy Broughan said. It is a pity he did not urge his colleagues the way he is urging me when they were in Government. Its record bears no comparison with what the Government has done in the social welfare area. To come in here in this way begs a few questions. The figures published by the CSO yesterday showed that inflation stood at 5.2% in May. This is above our expectations and above the forecasts of most other independent commentators and forecasters. The latest position is clearly disappointing.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's financial statement to the House last December he outlined a range of social welfare expenditure increases that continued to build upon the social inclusion policy of the Government since it assumed office. It will be recalled that budget 2000 contained full year social welfare improvements costing in the region of £400 million as compared to £215 million in the 1997 budget. Total spending on social welfare in the current year is now almost £5.4 billion or 20% above the 1997 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's previous two budgets it is worth noting that the general social welfare rate increases were in excess of 4% per annum, substantially above the inflation rate of approximately 2% per annum. This was particularly the <Col N="691" /> case for old age pension recipients who enjoyed increases in the order of 6% to 8% in each year.</P>
    <P>In the 2000 budget, provision was made for further substantial increases in all social welfare payments of approximately 5.5% for general rates and 8% to 9% in respect of social welfare old age pensions. Furthermore, the Minister announced improvements in the level of the qualified adult allowance payments such that they will increase from their level of roughly 60% of the personal rate to approximately 70% over three years. As the first stage in this increase, the 2000 budget provided for a general increase in qualified adult allowances of £3.80 per week or 9%, while qualified adult allowance increases in respect of social welfare old age pensions were £4.70 per week or approximately 8%.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the main themes of the social welfare package in the last three budgets were to: secure the future of our older people; improve the living standards of everybody on social welfare; give particular support to people with disabilities and carers; and support families and communities, which the Government achieved in an extraordinary way.</P>
    <P>The action programme promised that the old age contributory pensions would reach £100 per week within the lifetime of the Government. Over our first two budgets in 1998 and 1999 we provided record increases, bringing us half way to reaching the figure of £100 in just two years. In the review of the action programme the Government promised to bring forward that target for contributory old age pensioners and to extend the commitment to all social welfare pensions for older people. We are well on target to meeting this.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these increases, allied to various other improvements such as increased child benefit, improvements in the system of capital assessment and the earlier effective date of payments which have now been brought forward to the <Col N="692" /> month of May, that social welfare recipients continue to enjoy real improvements in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>More generally, the Government is concerned about the recent increase in inflation and shares the concerns expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the IBEC and the other social partners. The Government is fully committed to the partnership process which has brought such enormous benefits to the country. We intend to ensure that this process remains intact. We will shortly meet the social partners to discuss the situation.</P>
    <P>Appropriate responses, however, need to take account of the reasons for the increase in inflation. These include: higher oil prices, the weak euro, higher excise duties on tobacco, increases in mortgage interest rates and higher services prices. Clearly, a number of these factors are outside our control, for example, the value of the euro or the price of oil on international markets. Over time, inflation will start to ease back as some of these factors become less important. The Government is determined that our economic success continues so that we can ensure we have the resources to look after the less well-off in the community. Therefore, in areas where we have influence we are determined to take appropriate action against inflation.</P>
    <P>As regards price pressures in the housing market, we announced a package of measures today. These measures will complement the existing policies which are having some success. I hope they will improve the housing market.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is Government's view that some of the increase in prices, most notably in the services sector, is partly the result of anti-competitive practices. The ongoing increase in the price of alcoholic drinks is a clear example of this. The Government is committed to increasing competition and tackling anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 June 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 50 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I attended the Foreign Ministers meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, held in Florence on 25 May 2000. I also attended the official dinner held on 24 May.</P>
      <P>The EAPC is the multilateral political framework for Partnership for Peace nations. The EAPC meets twice a year at the level of Foreign Ministers. The meeting on 25 May welcomed Croatia as the 46th member of the EAPC and the PfP. The meeting was significant, in particular, for the renewed active participation of Russia in the deliberations of the EAPC. I welcome Russia's new engagement in the work of the EAPC.</P>
      <P>The theme of the Florence meeting was, Effective Use of EAPC/PfP in Conflict Prevention and in Crisis Management. A broad exchange of views took place which ranged across the work of the stability pact for south east Europe, the situation in the Balkans, and the growing activities and importance of EAPC and PfP. No formal conclusions were reached by the meeting.</P>
      <P>In my intervention, I underlined PfP's importance as a framework for refining interoperability and capabilities for peacekeeping and crisis management. I welcomed the emphasis in EAPC on practical co-operation relating to the Kosovo and Bosnia situations, including peacekeeping issues regarding SFOR and KFOR in which Irish troops participate. Along with other non-NATO troop contributors to SFOR and KFOR, I look forward to progress on further developing consultation arrangements involving the troop contributors in the EAPC framework. I also expressed Ireland's particular support for the EAPC's ongoing work in the areas of conflict prevention, global humanitarian action against mines and the challenges posed by the transfer of small arms.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell met a group of Kosovar refugees on 9 May to discuss a number of questions they had raised regarding their position in Ireland. She has also been in touch with them subsequently on a number of points made at that meeting.</P>
      <P>She informed them that the UN High Commission for Refugees has indicated formally to host countries that it was now safe for the vast majority of Kosovar refugees in asylum countries to return home. At the same time, the UNHCR has called for a co-ordinated and phased return of refugees to Kosovo. I might note that since the Minister of State's meeting with the refugees, the UNHCR has in recent days come out in favour of phased return over a number of years, because the situation there remains extremely precarious, with pressures on all services and few real possibilities for employment at the current time. This is naturally something to which we would wish to have regard in further consideration of the future of what has been to date a very successful programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make very clear the Minister of State and I support a voluntary return programme. Those who wish to return home now will be assisted financially by the Government to help them start the process of rebuilding their homes and their lives. We are working on this at the moment. Some refugees, on the other hand, may not feel ready to return to Kosovo at present, and we believe it would be appropriate to allow them to remain in Ireland for a further period. When <Col N="695" /> the refugees came to Ireland last year, it was indicated to them that, if they wished, they could apply to extend their permission to remain beyond the initial period of one year granted to them. The refugees have clearly benefited from their time here and a further period would allow them more time to consolidate their situation before returning.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is in touch with other relevant Ministers regarding the future of the programme and official level discussions will also take place next week. Decisions on the programme will be made as quickly as is consistent with a humane and considered approach based on the needs of the refugees.</P>

      <P>The situation in Portadown is a cause of concern. This year the Portadown district lodge has made applications for parades along the Garvaghy Road on two consecutive Sundays &ndash; 2 July and 9 July.</P>
      <P>The Government has maintained a consistent approach to the parades question based on mutual respect, dialogue, agreement and respect for the law, including the rights of local communities. We have stressed that the resolution of contentious parades lies through dialogue and local agreement. However, no agreed and mutually-acceptable solution has yet been found to the Drumcree dispute.</P>
      <P>An initiative has recently begun which is being facilitated by Brian Currin, a South African lawyer with a background in mediation and joint chair of the Sentence Review Commission in Northern Ireland. He has been appointed by the parties to the Drumcree dispute as an independent and impartial mediator. I understand that this process is looking at the broader issues surrounding the problem with a view to a possible resolution in the longer term. At this stage, Mr. Currin is working with the parties in drawing up an agreed mediation process. This initiative is to be welcomed. We would encourage all those involved to work with Mr. Currin in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>As I said, this initiative is at an early stage and I believe it would be unwise for any of us to burden it with undue expectations or pressures.</P>
      <P>The situation on the Garvaghy Road will, of course, continue to be monitored closely by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs over the coming weeks. The Government will maintain contact with the British Government on the issue through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to working with our EU partners to help ensure that the UN is given adequate resources to enable it to fulfil its key international role in conflict prevention and resolution. The UN has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The forthcoming millennium summit in September will offer the opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its confidence in the UN through a political commitment to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to deploy peace support operations quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has already made, over many years, a major contribution to peace through peacekeeping operations. Many UN peacekeeping operations have been very successful. We in Ireland can be very proud of the contribution made by our Defence Forces, notably in the Lebanon since 1978. However, there have also been failures. The UN itself is highly aware of the deficiencies in peacekeeping operations which have led to the scenes witnessed recently in Sierra Leone and previously in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. The Secretary-General himself has openly admitted that the UN has made grave mistakes.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General has appointed a high-level panel to review all aspects of UN peacekeeping and to report back before the millennium summit. A new generation of complex peacekeeping operations, with political, humanitarian and military dimensions, has made it essential that the various departments and agencies of the UN involved work together in a coherent and co-ordinated manner. This, and the need to improve the UN's rapid deployment capability are among the issues which the review panel will address. We look forward to the report of the panel and will give it our fullest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important new legal protection for UN peacekeepers is the Convention on the Safety of UN and Associated Personnel. Ireland fully supports this convention, which reflects the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against United Nations personnel working in the field. Attacks against, detention, or other mistreatment of personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations are unjustifiable and unacceptable. The convention aims to secure the better protection of personnel working on behalf of the United Nations in the areas of preventive diplomacy, <Col N="697" /> peace support, humanitarian and other operations. It entered into force on 15 January 1999 and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has published a Bill to enable Ireland to ratify the convention. This is now at the final stages of consideration by this House.</P>
    <P>Ireland at present contributes just over 700 military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping missions, with our main participation in UNIFIL. We underlined our commitment to UN peacekeeping in 1998 by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN committing 850 Defence Forces personnel to UN peacekeeping under the UN Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS. This initiative is designed to increase the UN's capacity to respond to emergency situations. Some 88 countries have indicated their willingness to participate in UNSAS, and 32 countries have signed a Memorandum of Understanding formalising their commitment. Most of the personnel committed by Ireland are already on service with UN, and UN authorised, peace support missions at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 22 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, European security and defence policy is the subject of ongoing and active discussion within the EU. The basis of these discussions is the Treaty of Amsterdam and their focus is on Petersberg Tasks, not mutual defence commitments. I had a useful discussion of these issues with Mr. Solana during his visit to Ireland at the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I believe, is referring to a draft document prepared by the Portuguese Presidency earlier this year. The EU will require access to NATO's resources, particularly its transport and infrastructural assets, for carrying out substantial Petersberg Tasks. This will require EU consul<Col N="698" /> tation and co-operation with NATO. All EU member states are already co-operating with NATO both in the context of participation in the UN-mandated, NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and in the context of PfP. The UN and the OSCE have well-established co-operation with NATO. In keeping with its mandate from the Helsinki European Council, the Presidency has chaired EU discussions regarding the principles and modalities for EU relations with NATO in this context. The question of mutual defence commitments does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will submit a progress report to the forthcoming European Council in Feira. This progress report will include principles which will govern EU consultations with NATO. Co-operation between institutions with a role to play in enhancing European security and stability has been encouraged by the OSCE since the early 1990's.</P>
    <P>In regard to EU plans for a rapid reaction capability, what was agreed at the Helsinki European Council was a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. Deputies will be aware that this target, known as a headline goal, which the member states aim to meet by 2003, is to be able to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission on a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki conclusions make clear that we are not talking about the creation of a European army. What is involved is not a standing army but rather the enhanced ability to prevent, manage and resolve crises. Participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis, and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case. The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers, was mandated at Helsinki to take forward the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which this target could be met, and progress reviewed. The Presidency report to the Feira European Council will note progress in elaborating this target. As my colleague, the Minister for Defence has indicated, the question of what contribution Ireland can make will be considered in the context of this process, taking account of the voluntary and case by case nature of the Petersberg Tasks, current Defence Force overseas commitments and security requirements at home. Member states will also use existing planning procedures which, in the case of Ireland and the other neutral and non-allied EU member states, would include the planning and review process of the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the EU is developing in the context of crisis management its civil capabilities, including the capabilities target of being able collectively to supply up to five <Col N="699" />  thousand police officers for the full range of crisis prevention and crisis management operations by 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 55 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the tragic developments in Sierra Leone. Although the security situation has been stabilising, it nevertheless remains highly volatile. Together with EU partners we have discussed these events on a number of occasions, most recently at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg last Tuesday, 13 June where we reiterated our deep concern about the continuing crisis and strongly supported the efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces to restore long-term peace and stability to that country. We have appealed to the international community to join the EU in supporting a strategy in Sierra Leone which further stabilises the security situation, repels the rebels, restores the peace process and helps rebuild Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>Since its signature in July of last year, we have consistently expressed our support for the Lomé Peace Agreement, and called on all parties to strictly adhere to its terms in order to achieve a lasting peaceful resolution of a conflict that has imposed immense suffering on the people of Sierra Leone. In this respect, we have emphasised that the accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is important in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and ultimately, reconciliation and stability in the country.</P>
      <P>The recent 56th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, where Ireland is an active participant, adopted a resolution on the Human Rights situation in Sierra Leone by consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have strongly condemned the recent actions taken by the Revolutionary United Front, <Col N="700" /> in direct violation of the peace agreement, and are deeply disturbed by reports of the killing of personnel from the UN Mission in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>We have called on the RUF to end all violence, to disarm, to release all detainees unconditionally and safely, and to implement the Lomé Peace Agreement which remains the basis for lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We have also called on it to cease all attacks against UNAMSIL, and to implement fully its commitments under the peace agreement, including the implementation of the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme. Together with our EU colleagues we have welcomed the decision of the Government of Sierra Leone to put Foday Sankoh, the leader of the RUF, on trial.</P>
    <P>The Government has, with our European Union partners, expressed its grave concern over the allegations of arms shipments that have helped the RUF to sustain military operations since the peace agreement was concluded, and we have called on all parties to refrain from any action that contributes to prolonging the conflict further. While acknowledging the responsible role that President Taylor of Liberia played in the release of UN detainees held by the RUF in Sierra Leone, we have expressed concern that he has failed to act to prevent arms and other supplies from reaching the rebels from the territory of Liberia, and that the illicit diamond trade which provides finance for the rebel activities continues through Liberia.</P>
    <P>We have expressed our strong support for the efforts of the United Nations to fulfil its mandate in Sierra Leone. Recognising that a strong, effective and robust UN force is essential if lasting peace is to be achieved, we have appealed to the international community to offer increased support for UNAMSIL.</P>
    <P>The Government and its EU partners are determined that UNAMSIL be given the support needed to fulfil the mandate given to it by the Security Council. We support the appeal of UN Secretary-General Annan to the leaders of the region to redouble their efforts to bring the situation under control and we welcome international efforts in support of the implementation of the Security Council resolutions. We have agreed to consider urgently what practical support we might give in order to help the UN fulfil its mandate, and to strengthen the UN presence in Sierra Leone over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone and at alleviating the suffering caused to the people there by the nine years of civil war in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 30 April 2000, Ireland was owed IR£7.1 million approximately for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The only missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET. During 1999, the UN repaid arrears of approximately £5.5 million to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations Headquarters in this regard.</P>
      <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This has resulted in a serious day-to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears would ease the situation considerably. The United States Administration has now tabled a plan, agreed with Congress, to deal with the arrears problem which also contains proposals for reform of the UN financing system. This plan will be the subject of detailed negotiations at the United Nations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, will participate constructively in the process.</P>
      <P>A successful outcome to the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries. In the meantime, I assure the House that Ireland's Permanent Mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>

      <P>The British territory of Montserrat has been subject to continued volcanic activity over recent years. In 1997 a massive eruption led to the evacuation of the population to neighbouring islands or to the safer northern part of the island. At that time the British Government led the aid effort by providing assistance for emergency shelter and medical needs. The Caribbean community, Caricom, also provided assistance and hosted thousands who had fled the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the situation has been relatively stable since 1997 there remains a significant threat of volcanic activity which has led to the southern part of the island being designated an exclusion <Col N="703" /> zone. As recently as March of this year eruptions have taken place and it is presumed that this intermittent activity will continue for many years. The population has increased to 5,000 as people have returned although this still leaves another 5,000 living on neighbouring islands.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the eruption in 1997 the Government received only one request for assistance to Montserrat. This was a request to support the credit union movement on the island through the Irish League of Credit Unions. A grant of £25,000 was provided for the loan fund of the credit union and this grant is still in use.</P>
    <P>The Chief Minister of Montserrat has expressed an interest in exploring the potential for co-operation between Montserrat and Ireland. However, the type of co-operation outlined is not for the reconstruction of homes or infrastructure but to promote private sector development on Montserrat. In principle, my Department would be pleased to arrange contacts for the Montserrat authorities with the relevant State agencies who would be in a position to share the experience of Ireland's economic development. The reconstruction needs of the island are already being met through substantial funding by the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>First advocated over two decades ago by Nobel Prize-winning economist, James Tobin, the currency transaction tax or &ldquo;Tobin Tax&rdquo; is intended to be applied to every international financial market transaction to slow down currency speculation and capital flight from weak economies. There was renewed interest in the proposed tax in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-8. Many championed the tax as a way to raise significant funds for development assistance.</P>
      <P>The proposal for such a tax addresses important development objectives such as reducing volatility on the international financial markets and mobilising increased resources for development assistance. However, there appears to be a range of serious practical difficulties in its implementation which detract from its potential. To become a reality, a Tobin tax would require close co-operation on a global scale. It would, for example, have to be introduced simultaneously in all major economies to avoid the flight of capital to a jurisdiction which did not enforce the tax. A unilateral application of the tax would carry obvious risks for the economy of the country in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland's case the attitude of our Community partners, particularly those committed to <Col N="704" /> EMU, would be crucial. At a minimum, for any such tax to operate effectively, all EU members would have to agree. I am not aware of such a consensus at present in the Community.</P>

      <P>The current accession process was launched by the 15 EU member states, the ten Central and Eastern European States and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. The following day, actual negotiations were inaugurated with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus. These countries are now referred to as the &ldquo;Luxembourg candidates&rdquo;. Negotiations have continued with these countries since then on a policy chapter basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a preparatory process for negotiations continued with the other original applicants, the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&ndash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. Malta joined this group in 1999.</P>
      <P>Based upon recommendations from the Commission, the Helsinki European Council on 10 December 1999 decided that the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;, including Malta, had reached a sufficient level of preparation to allow accession negotiations to be opened in 2000. This group is now referred to as the &ldquo;Helsinki candidates&rdquo;. Negotiations with the Helsinki candidates began formally in Brussels on 15 February 2000. Actual substantive negotiations began in March, with the number and subject of negotiation chapters opened in accordance with the level of preparation in each country.</P>
      <P>The reaffirmation by the European Council that the accession negotiation process for all 12 applicant countries should be on an equal footing and that each should proceed on the basis of its own merits and level of preparedness was significant. This should ensure that the new member states are capable of functioning effectively in the highly competitive European market.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council also decided that the European Union should be in a position to &ldquo;welcome new member states from the end of 2002, as soon as they have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership&rdquo; and once the negotiating process has been successfully completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council granted candidate status and an intensified pre-negotiation relationship with the EU to Turkey. Turkey will now benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. Significantly, this will entail a political dialogue with a particular emphasis on human rights. Actual accession <Col N="705" /> negotiations cannot begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. These rigorous criteria of democracy, human rights, protection of minorities, and the rule of law are the same for Turkey as for all other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>The opening of the negotiating chapter on agriculture with the Luxembourg candidates on 14 June means that all possible chapters of negotiations have now been opened for these groups. Negotiation with the Luxembourg candidates have thus now entered a more substantive phase. The one chapter left for opening with the Luxembourg candidates is Institutions. The Intergovernmental Conference on internal EU reform must be completed before negotiations can be started in this area.</P>
    <P>The Commission will table in late June-early July recommendations on the opening of further chapters with the Helsinki candidates during the French Presidency.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. We are satisfied with the progress in negotiations to date and look forward to welcoming the new member states, when they have satisfactorily completed their negotiations and have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership.</P>

      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 96 states have signed the statute and, of these, ten have now ratified the statute.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Constitution is required to enable the State to ratify the statute.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the need to amend the Constitution, a careful and detailed examination of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, together with my own Department, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary in order to determine the precise nature and scope of the legislative and administrative measures which may need to be introduced in order for Ireland <Col N="706" /> to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take but I assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has closely followed developments in Peru, including the recent Presidential elections, and together with our partners in the European Union, we have been active in articulating our concerns about developments both directly to the Peruvian authorities in Lima and in appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>At the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland was fully associated with a statement made by the Portuguese EU Presidency on behalf of the Union as a whole which noted with alarm the decline in Peru of the rule of law including the deterioration in the electoral process. The statement expressed the Union's concern about practices which seriously undermine the separation of powers, the lack of due process particularly where military penal courts of justice are concerned, disrespect for procedural guarantees, harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and opposition political leaders, extra-judicial executions, torture and appalling conditions in detention centres.</P>
      <P>In view of the deep concern of the Irish and other EU Governments regarding aspects of the conduct of the Peruvian election campaign, the Portuguese Presidency issued a further statement on behalf of the EU on 7 April, just prior to the first round of elections &ndash; in Lisbon, Brussels and Lima &ndash; drawing attention to the fact that the Union was closely monitoring the electoral process, and urging the authorities to adopt all the necessary measures to ensure that the Peruvian people could express their will in freedom and democracy, without undue pressure of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following reliable reports of widespread irregularities and anomalies in the first round of the process, and concerns regarding the vote-<Col N="707" /> counting software, the Organisation of American States and the European Union pressed for a postponement of the second round of elections scheduled for 28 May. However, the Peruvian authorities chose to proceed, notwithstanding the decision of the challenger, Alejandro Toledo, to boycott the election. Both OAS and other international observers, including a number from EU countries, withdrew from Peru before 28 May, and the Portuguese Presidency issued a statement on behalf of the EU expressing our deep concern at the decision to proceed with the second round.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement that President Fujimori had won the uncontested second round, the OAS Electoral Observer Mission, led by former Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein, issued a report condemning the conduct of the election. Meeting at their annual General Assembly in Canada last week, OAS Foreign Ministers agreed to dispatch a mission to Peru, led by Canadian Foreign Minister Axworthy and OAS Secretary-General Gaviria, with the aim of strengthening democracy there. In a statement issued on 9 June, the Portuguese Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, welcomed the OAS mission, reiterated its concern about irregularities in the electoral process, and expressed support for democratic forces in Peru which seek to reinforce institutions and to safeguard political freedoms and the rule of law. The statement also urged the Peruvian Government to work for consensus with all political forces in the country to find ways to strengthen democracy. The EU is closely following the situation in Peru as it develops, and against that background, will review its relations with Lima.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that the progress made over the past decade in the consolidation of democracy in Latin America must not be lost. This view is central to our policy, and that of the EU as a whole, towards Peru and the entire Latin American region.</P>

      <P>The Government strongly supports the Middle East peace process and, together with the European Union, we contribute actively to encouraging the Peace Process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians followed the signing of the Sharm-el-Sheikh <Col N="708" /> Memorandum last September. Despite making a certain amount of progress, the talks have suffered many setbacks and have been suspended on a number of occasions including quite recently. The sudden death of President Assad &ndash; on which we have sent our condolences to the Government and people of Syria &ndash; introduces a further element of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Following the recent visit by the US Secretary of State to the region, talks between the Israelis and Palestinians resumed in Washington on 13 June. Depending on progress made, these talks are expected to be followed by a trilateral summit between Presidents Arafat and Clinton and Prime Minister Barak towards the end of June. Both the Israeli and Palestinian sides recognise that negotiations will have to be accelerated if the deadline of 13 September for reaching a settlement is to be met. Nevertheless, the difficulties are considerable. There are three particularly contentious issues: borders, Jerusalem and return of refugees. It is the Government's hope that it will be possible to arrive at an agreement which will deal comprehensively with all the issues arising in the Palestinian Track of the Peace Process, as well as in the Lebanese and Syrian Tracks. This alone can guarantee a just and lasting peace settlement.</P>
    <P>At this point it is extremely difficult to assess the prospects. We wish both parties every success in their endeavours. Once again, we would call on them to refrain from any acts which would make the negotiations more difficult, whether through resort to violence or the creation of new facts on the ground. We call on them also to take all necessary steps to re-establish mutual confidence, to accept the need for making concessions, and to focus on the overriding goal of achieving lasting peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>In its Berlin Declaration of 24-25 March 1999 the European Council reaffirmed the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination, including the option of a State, and looked forward to the early fulfilment of this right. We hope that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which have now entered their most critical phase, will bring about the reintegration and reconstitution of Palestine as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 30 together.</P>
    <P>The Government, together with its EU partners, views the situation in Fiji with great concern. We have condemned the overthrow of the democratically elected government. There is now a risk of further violence and disorder which, if not contained, could in a worst case scenario degenerate into civil war.</P>
    <P>Since the attempted coup and the taking of hostages, including the lawfully elected Prime Minister and members of his cabinet, on 19 May the situation has deteriorated. The hostages are still being held in captivity in the Parliament building. The Prime Minister and the President have resigned from their offices, the Constitution has been suspended and martial law has been imposed by an interim military government. Negotiations between the head of the armed forces and the leader of the coup have been suspended. In addition, there are serious divisions in the great council of chiefs, with the prospect of these resulting in a split in the country, leading to a new concentration in power away from the capital, Suva, towards the western region. The complexity of this situation is compounded by ethnic tensions between the indigenous population and the sizeable Indian minority.</P>
    <P>There has also been widescale looting and damage to property, as well as serious economic consequences and loss of employment in several sectors. The question of the international community imposing economic and trade sanctions cannot be ruled out because of the serious implications of overthrowing a lawfully elected government and undermining the pluralistic constitution, but the impact of any such measures on the least economically developed sectors of Fijian society would have to be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>International mediation has been offered by countries of the region and others with historical ties with Fiji but these have not yet been taken up.</P>
    <P>There are about fifty Irish citizens in Fiji but few, if any, are now in or around the capital, Suva. In order to ensure the safety of our citizens, my Department and the embassy in Canberra are maintaining close contact with EU partners with diplomatic missions in Fiji and with other countries such as Australia and New Zealand with significant interests and communities there. Irish citizens are being advised against non-essential travel to Fiji for the present and any who may still be in Suva are being advised to move out of the area. As is usual in circumstances such as this, there are contingency plans for the evacuation of foreign, including Irish, nationals should the security situation require such action.</P>
    <P>The Government, together with its EU, partners will keep the situation under close review with a view to helping to bring about a resolution of the crisis should circumstances permit such a role.</P>

      <P>EU Foreign Ministers have consistently called on the Government of Zimbabwe to take the steps necessary to resolve the deteriorating situation as a matter of urgency and to ensure respect for the law and maintain public order and civil protection. We have stressed the fundamental importance of respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. Last month we made a further urgent appeal to the Government of Zimbabwe to put an end to the violence and intimidation and expressed our hope that the forthcoming elections would be free and fair. In this context, we endorsed the European Commission's intention to deploy a substantial number of EU election observers in Zimbabwe and stressed the importance of close co-ordination with other contingents of international observers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week at the General Affairs Council we again expressed our concern at the ongoing violence and intimidation and the recent obstacles put in the way of international observers who have arrived in the country ahead of the elections. We recalled that the observers are there with the consent of the Government of Zimbabwe and that we expect the Government to make good on its assurances about the security and freedom of access for the observers. We urged the Government of Zimbabwe to do all it can to assist them in their work to observe the forthcoming elections in a transparent and comprehensive way so as to increase confidence in the electoral process.</P>
      <P>Ireland was a long-standing supporter of the Zimbabwean independence movement. The Government will continue to support all peaceful efforts to resolve the present difficulties, and to ensure that the democracy which the people of Zimbabwe worked so hard to achieve will continue to grow and prosper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned at the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which together with displacement, hunger and human rights violations, is causing severe hardship for the civilian population. The involvement of neighbouring states, some of which are providing military support to the protagonists, has grave implications for the peace and stability of the region as a whole.</P>
      <P>We are concerned at the slow pace of implementation of the Lusaka accords signed, in July 1999, by the governments of the six countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Uganda, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo itself. Two rebel groups, the MLC (Movement for the Liberation of Congo) and the RCD (Congolese Rally for Democracy), signed the cease fire agreement in August. Together with our European Union partners we have urged all parties to the conflict to stop all military activities and respect in full their commitments under the Lusaka agreement.</P>
      <P>We have reiterated our support for the Lusaka agreement and are ready to continue to assist African efforts and support the United Nations in managing the crisis and in restoring peace and stability to the DRC through political, diplomatic and financial means. The ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the Lusaka agreement, however, continues to rest with the parties themselves, including by assuring that conditions are in place to enable the early deployment of the UN observer mission.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to support the work of the EU special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures and EU high representative, Solana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region as a means of ensuring lasting stability. As the EU Council of Ministers underlined last month the number and complexity of factors of a political, economic and social nature which are at the root of these conflicts require a realistic, integrated and coherent approach by the international community using different types of instruments appropriate to the prevailing circumstances. The main objective of the EU will remain the creation of conditions to allow the gradual attainment of a durable solution to the conflicts affecting the Great Lakes region, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, which will necessarily have to include respect for inter<Col N="712" /> national law and principles, guarantees of security for all, an end to impunity, and respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights. We remain deeply concerned about the continuous violations of human rights that are perpetrated by both state and non-state parties in the Great Lakes region, and together with our EU partners, have urged all parties concerned to refrain from any further violations.</P>
    <P>Almost 14 million people have been directly affected by the war in the DRC and are in need of humanitarian assistance. While we continue to strive for a peaceful political settlement to the crisis, Ireland Aid will continue to provide humanitarian aid to those in greatest need.</P>

      <P>Following the very successful meeting between the Taoiseach and Colonel Ghadaffi in Cairo in April, during which they discussed a detailed review of bilateral relations between Ireland and Libya, I visited Libya last week for meetings with the Libyan Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdul Shalgam. During our discussions we reached an agreement to lift the ban on exports of live cattle from Ireland to Libya that had been in place since 1996. It was agreed that Ireland would forthwith be officially listed as a source country for all tenders opened by Libya for the supply of live cattle. This agreement is a major step in our developing relationship and the reopening of this major export market follows long and intensive work by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and me, and the officials concerned.</P>
      <P>In the course of our discussions the Libyan side expressed full support for the Northern Ireland peace process and for the efforts of the Irish Government to secure justice, equality and a lasting settlement of the political situation there.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that in further developing and promoting bilateral relations between our two countries, we would establish permanent diplomatic missions in each others countries at ambassadorial level. The timing of this is to be decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 71 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned at the failure to resolve the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It has conveyed its views about the need to put an immediate end to the fighting and to resume peace negotiations under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) mediation to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities on a number of occasions. The current situation is not only causing immense suffering for the civilian population, it is also destabilising for both countries and for the wider region of east Africa, including Sudan.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, at the OAU summit in Algiers, OAU Heads of State and Government approved the modalities for the implementation of a framework agreement on the settlement of the conflict between the two countries. With its partners in the European Union Ireland welcomed this agreement and urged both sides to immediately support it. Unfortunately, differences between the two sides on the technical arrangements for the Implementation of the framework agreement persisted and, consequently, no progress was made on implementing the agreement.</P>
      <P>Following intensive negotiations earlier this year led by OAU special representative Ahmed Ouyahia, representing OAU chairperson President Bouteflika of Algeria, with the support of the US, the UN and the EU, represented by the presidency's special representative to Ethiopia and Eritrea, Senator Rino Serri, both countries returned to proximity talks in Algiers at the end of April. Unfortunately, the talks collapsed almost immediately. Ireland called on the Governments of the two countries to enter immediately and without preconditions into further negotiations in order to reach agreement and to refrain from taking any military action which would have disastrous consequences for both countries. The European Union also reiterated its readiness to support the implementation of the OAU peace settlement.</P>
      <P>In spite of international appeals, renewed hostilities broke out on 12 May. The United Nations Security Council strongly condemned the renewed fighting, demanded that both parties cease all military action and return to the OAU negotiations and called on those concerned to ensure the safety of civilian populations and fully respect human rights and international humanitarian law. In May, the United Nations imposed an embargo on the sale or supply to Ethiopia and Eritrea of arms and related material of all types including weapons, ammunition and military equipment, for a period of twelve months at the end of which the situation will be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> Together with its partners in the European Union, Ireland deeply deplores the resumption of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea and has condemned the continuation of a conflict which endangers the security and development of the region, particularly in view of the food crisis. Ireland has appealed to both sides to put an immediate end to the fighting and to resume peace negotiations in order to reach agreement on the technical arrangements for the implementation of the framework agreement and the modalities accepted by both sides. Ireland reiterated its support for the peace efforts of the OAU and its willingness to assist with the implementation of the peace agreement that it hopes will be achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Recalling the responsibility of any government for its people, Ireland has noted that the fighting has dramatic humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of the two countries and deplores the fact that, against a severe food crisis in the region, precious resources were being diverted to the conflict. Together with EU colleagues, Ireland has confirmed its willingness to provide emergency and humanitarian aid carefully targeted to the people most seriously in need, in order to avoid any possible diversion of such aid.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support all international efforts, notably those of the OAU and the UN, vigorously to pursue the peace process and to achieve a comprehensive settlement to this futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford.</P>
    <P>The Ireland Aid country programme for Ethiopia for this year is valued at £16.184 million and is set to rise to £18.935 million in 2001. The programme is focused on the long-term needs of the rural poor, although £2 million has been re-allocated from this year's budget to help offset the more immediate impact of the drought induced crisis. Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, visited Ethiopia from 2-7 May to assess the humanitarian situation, the status of the emergency relief response and Ireland aid's long-term development activities. During her visit, the Minister of State was also briefed on political developments, including the conflict with Eritrea, and stressed Ireland's support for the OAU peace process. Minister of State, O'Donnell, briefed the EU Council of Development Ministers on the situation on her return. An official delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is also scheduled to travel to Ethiopia from 17 to 24 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the escalating conflict between the forces of the Government of Sri Lanka and secessionist Tamil forces. Since the fighting began in 1983 more than 60,000 <Col N="715" /> deaths have resulted. Many of these casualties have been caused by indiscriminate terrorist attacks by Tamil fighters &ndash; the so-called Tamil Tigers or LTTE &ndash; often carried out by suicide bombers and against the civilian population.</P>
      <P>Fighting renewed in intensity in April when the Government forces suffered a number of setbacks in the northern region of the country, notably in Elephant Pass which links the Jaffna peninsula to the rest of the country and around the city of Jaffna itself. Sporadic attacks against Government forces and the civilian population also continue elsewhere throughout the country and the Minister for Industrial Development and 21 other innocent people were killed, with 60 injured, in a suicide bomb attack in the capital Colombo on 7 June.</P>
      <P>The conflict is not only a tragedy for the people of Sri Lanka, but has serious implications for the region, including India, where there is a large Tamil population in the south of the country.</P>
      <P>The EU has called on the secessionist forces, the LTTE, to end its indiscriminate acts of violence and to enter into negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government. The EU has also urged the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the framework of Sri Lanka's territorial integrity.</P>
      <P>The conflict in Sri Lanka will only be solved ultimately through a political solution, reflecting the fact that although the Tamils are a minority in the country as whole, they are in the majority in the North. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Government and opposition parties of Sri Lanka to reach a consensus on how to address this problem. Such a consensus has not existed in the past but I hope that recent reports that one may now be imminent will be substantiated. I am also encouraged that the Prime Minister of India has forged a consensus among political parties in his country about the stance that India should adopt in regard to the situation, and in support of a solution respecting the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>While the conflict in Sri Lanka has not been amenable so far to international mediation, the Government of Norway has offered its good offices as mediator of the talks. The EU fully supports Norway in this endeavour.</P>

      <P>The budget for official development assistance (ODA) has grown very considerably in recent years. However, the size of the budget relative to GNP has not made comparable progress. The explanation for this discrepancy is the exceptional GNP growth of recent years and the introduction of a new method of GNP measurement which has had the effect of increasing the nominal size of GNP. For the period 1997-99, the figures were as follows:</P>

    <P>The allocation for the current year is £201 million which is equivalent to 0.31% of estimated GNP.</P>
    <P>As to the future, I am very close to bringing proposals to Government which would have the effect of establishing a growth strategy for ODA. The objective of the proposed strategy is to achieve steady growth of ODA in both financial and GNP terms with a view to achieving the target of 0.7% of GNP as ODA within a definite and realistic timescale. I expect to be in a position to present my proposals to Government within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The possible expansion of the list of priority countries for our bilateral assistance will also be considered in the context of my proposals for Government. As the House is aware, there are currently six priority countries for our bilateral programme: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. While the possibility of expanding the list is attractive in the context of a growing budget, the policy implications of the choice of a new priority country would <Col N="717" /> have to be carefully considered. It would also be necessary to give close attention to the timing and the management implications of any such initiative.</P>

      <P>This Government is aware of the practice of forced labour in Burma and has taken action, along with its EU-partners, on a number of recent occasions.</P>
      <P>The EU is active in ongoing discussions at the current ILO conference in Geneva which concerns in part the implementation of the recommendations of the ILO commission of inquiry on forced labour in Burma. A resolution regarding Burma will be discussed by the ILO this week.</P>
      <P>The EU is taking a strong stance at the current ILO meetings and will issue a statement which will, <i>inter alia</i>, restate EU condemnation of human rights abuses in Burma, refer to previous EU action against Burma and point out that the means for resolving the issue rest with the Burmese authorities. It will also point out that no steps have been taken by Burma to implement the recommendations of the 1998 ILO commission of inquiry and call for measures to be taken against Burma under Article 33 of the ILO convention. These measures can include suspension.</P>
      <P>The terms of the resolution will essentially give the Burmese government another chance to implement the commission's recommendations. These recommendations call on Burma to repeal legislation permitting forced labour and to take action against those exacting forced labour. Article 33 sanctions would, under the terms of the agreement, be implemented by the ILO governing body in November if there has been no movement by the Burmese authorities by then.</P>
      <P>At the recent 56th Commission on Human Rights, an EU &ndash; sponsored resolution on the situation of human rights in Burma was adopted without a vote. This resolution deplored the widespread use of forced labour, including for work on infrastructure projects, production of food for the military and as porters for the army. The resolution also called on the Government of Burma to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to put an end to violations of the integrity of the human being and forced labour.</P>
      <P>The resolution also called on the Government of Burma to cease the widespread and systematic use of forced labour and use of exploitative child labour and to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry of the International Labour Organisation regarding the implementation of the Forced Labour Convention 1930 (No. 29) of the ILO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore when the EU reviewed its com<Col N="718" /> mon position on Burma in April 2000, it extended and strengthened its sanctions against the Burmese regime, because of continuing concern over the human rights situation there.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 62, 68 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the issues to be addressed at the European Council in Feira next week, the Government attaches particular importance to the intergovernmental conference. I have set out <Col N="719" /> comprehensively earlier today the Government's approach to the discussion expected at Feira on the Intergovernmental Conference. The conference is scheduled to conclude at the Nice European Council in December. A decision on whether or not a referendum will be necessary can only be taken in the light of legal advice on the eventual outcome of the conference.</P>
    <P>The issues in Common Foreign and Security Policy to be addressed at the European Council in Feira next week comprise European Security and Defence Policy, the proposed EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, South Eastern Europe, and the EU Common Strategy on the Mediterranean Region.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Feira will consider a Presidency progress report on follow-up to the Helsinki European Council regarding European Security and Defence Policy. Deputies will be aware that European Security and Defence Policy is the subject of ongoing and active discussion within the EU. The basis of these discussions is the Treaty of Amsterdam and their focus is on Petersberg Tasks, not mutual defence commitments.</P>
    <P>The Presidency report to Feira will cover the Petersberg Tasks and the civilian aspects of crisis management. Among the issues concerning the Petersberg tasks, the report will deal with the ongoing work of elaborating the voluntary capabilities target, known as the Headline Goal. In regard to the civilian aspects of crisis management, there will be a particular focus on the role of police in international peacekeeping missions. The report will also include an indication of whether Treaty amendment is judged necessary. As I mentioned, the basis of the EU's work in this area is the Treaty of Amsterdam and we see no case for Treaty amendment in this area.</P>
    <P>We take the view that a substantive discussion of the proposed EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should take place at Feira. A politically-oriented discussion on key issues should assist the work of the convention. The clarification of a number of key issues, including the status of the charter, the place of economic and social rights, and the question of consistency with the European Convention on Human Rights, would help focus the debate in the convention. The Taoiseach's representative will continue to state our preference for the charter to take the form of a political declaration rather than a legally binding text.</P>
    <P>The European Council will receive a report from Secretary General-High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten on progress on the priority issues identified in relation to South Eastern Europe by the Lisbon European Council. The report will also suggest some avenues for further action over the next few weeks and months. The report will cover progress to date on the dialogue with civil society and support for the independent media in Serbia. In relation to Kosovo the report will cover the contribution of the EU to the <Col N="720" /> creation of a positive environment for the municipal elections scheduled for October, support for UNMIK and reconstruction in the province. On Montenegro the report will make further proposals for aid to the reform government of President Djukanovic in Podgorica. The report will also cover EU support for the elections scheduled in the months ahead, progress to be expected in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with FYROM and Croatia, and support for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The report will also cover future EU support for the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The Vienna European Council, December 1998, decided on the preparation of common strategies on Russia, Ukraine, Western Balkans and the Mediterranean, taking into account the Barcelona Process and the Middle East Peace Process. Common strategies on Russia and Ukraine have already been adopted. The Portuguese Presidency wishes to have a common strategy on the Mediterranean adopted at Feira. We support the Presidency's aim.</P>
    <P>While enlargement is not a major issue for Feira, the European Council will take stock of the positive developments in the accession process which have taken place since its comprehensive discussion and decisions at Helsinki.</P>
    <P>The economic policy questions for Feira are Greek entry into EMU, the tax package and follow up to the Lisbon European Council, with particular reference to the Europe Action Plan and the Charter on Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs.</P>
    <P>A formal decision on Greece's application for the adoption by Greece of the Single Currency on 1 January 2001 will be taken at Feira. Ireland is happy to support this decision. The enlargement of EMU from 11 to 12 member states is a significant development for all the member states and for the Union.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of follow up to Lisbon, some attention will be given to the process of agreeing the broad economic policy guidelines. Lisbon envisaged that other Council formations would contribute to ECOFIN's preparation of the guidelines and that the European Council, which will in future devote a meeting every spring to economic and social questions, would take on a bigger co-ordinating and guiding role.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 47 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Robert Hamill died on 8 May 1997 following an attack in Portadown. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. Six people were charged in 1997 with his murder, but the charges in relation to five were dropped before they came to trial. One was convicted on 25 March 1999 for the offence of causing an affray and not of murder. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints supervised the RUC investigation into the actions of the RUC officers on the night in question, following which a report was sent to the DPP. On 30 September 1999, the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any RUC officer. The question of possible disciplinary action against the police officers in question is currently being considered. The RUC file on the case remains open.</P>
      <P>On 7 June last, the Coroner for Greater Belfast announced that he would not be holding an inquest in this case because of concerns for the safety of certain witnesses. The coroner, stated that their lives would be put in danger if their evidence were to be presented to an inquest but that, without their evidence, a seriously incomplete account of the circumstances of Mr Hamill's death would be given. In these circumstances, he took the view that no useful purpose would be served by holding an inquest.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the Government's concerns about the Hamill case have been actively pursued with the British authorities, both at official and at Ministerial level. In October 1999, the Government's disappointment at the DPP's decision and the widespread and deep concern that exists about this case was conveyed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>The Hamill case and the coroner's decision were discussed at the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in London on 7 June last. The following day, the Taoiseach met members of the Hamill family. Afterwards, the Taoiseach stated that the Hamill case was a matter of urgent public interest and that the issues of concern involved must be addressed in a manner which would command the confidence of the community, through an independent, judicial public inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains very concerned about the situation in Kosovo. Although the humanitarian need of most of the population is now being met a number of problems have yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>The security situation has been a serious problem since the end of the conflict, with recurring waves of inter ethnic violence. Attacks by members of the majority Kosovo Albanian population on the minority Serb and Roma communities have flared up again recently. In the past fortnight eight Serbs have been killed and 25 injured. In a recent report the Secretary General of the United Nations stated that members of minority communities, particularly Serbs, have been the victims of 330 serious ethnic crimes, such as murder, rape and kidnapping committed in Kosovo since January this year. As a protest against the security situation the moderate Gracanica Serbs have withdrawn from the Joint Interim Administrative Structure, JIAS, in which they had been participating for the last few weeks. The EU General Affairs Council which I attended earlier this week strongly urged the Gracanica Serbs to resume their co-operation with JIAS.</P>
      <P>During his recent visit to Kosovo, undertaken in the midst of this crisis in security for the Serb community, Secretary General-High Representative Solana was critical of the continuing failure of the Kosovo Albanian leadership to commit wholeheartedly to the establishment of a society founded on tolerance and peaceful coexistence. As the representatives of the majority community in Kosovo they have a responsibility to exert real influence on their communities. The moderate Serbs are in a difficult situation, intellectually committed to participate in joint structures, which have been set up to provide the people in Kosovo some say in their own government, but under pressure from more radical Serbs under the influence of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade and unable to reassure their community on the question of security. The future of the whole province depends on moderate leadership in all the ethnic communities asserting its belief in multi-ethnic structures.</P>
      <P>Recent developments have tended to overshadow otherwise significant positive changes which have taken place in Kosovo since I last answered a question in the House on this subject. The situation in Mitrovica, the scene of much intercommunal violence only a few weeks ago, is much calmer, although the town is essentially still divided between the Serb and Albanian communities. Progress is being made in the preparations for the elections to take place in October, although there is a problem in persuading more than a handful of Serbs to register. Economic reconstruction is going ahead. The EU Reconstruction Agency is up and running. Finally, there is an encouraging sign of the emergence of a moderate and less nationalistic leadership in the Kosovo Albanian community. A new moderate grouping will contest the local elections in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> The Government is working within international bodies &ndash; United Nations, EU, OSCE and the Council of Europe &ndash; to secure an improvement in the situation in Kosovo. This year my Department is committed to spending one million pounds on reconstruction in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The international community is committed to a democratic multi-cultural and pluralist Kosovo enjoying substantial autonomy and a meaningful self administration. Ireland and its EU partners are committed to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 in all its aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have primary responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's policy concerning the World Trade Organisation and the prospects for a new round of global trade negotiations. The Department of Foreign Affairs, at headquarters and through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva and the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, remains closely involved in the preparation and implementation of this policy.</P>
      <P>At the EU-US summit held near Lisbon on 31 May, both sides reaffirmed their conviction that the early launch of a new inclusive new round of WTO trade negotiations would offer a major boost to global economic growth, employment and sustainable development but should address in a balanced way the concerns of all WTO members. Both the EU and the US pledged to build on the constructive work of the last six months and to try to launch such a new round this year. Whether this ambition can be realised remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>In a separate statement on the need for accelerated action on HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa, the EU and the US acknowledged the special needs of Africa and the need to take special measures to assist with the development needs of the continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent report entitled &ldquo;Can Africa Claim the 21st Century&rdquo;, published by the World Bank, indicates that Africa now accounts for less than 2% of world trade. Africa has lost half its share of world markets &ndash; equivalent to almost $70 billion a year &ndash; since 1970. In addition less than <Col N="726" /> 1% of the huge international flows of foreign direct investment are invested in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>It is clear that many African countries and particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly marginalised from the global economy. They are failing to benefit from the trade liberalisation introduced by the Uruguay Round and many do not have the trade capacity to avail of their preferences under the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the inability of many poor African countries to participate in a globalising international economy are many. They include the corrosive effect of extreme poverty on their economies, conflict, the rapid spread of HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, poor governance, unfavourable macro-economic policies, lack of domestic resources for investment, lack of funds for education and health systems, poor institutional capacity in the trade area and over dependence on single commodities. Despite the liberalisation of trade under the Uruguay round, many products from the least developed countries continue to face high tariffs in industrialised markets.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the growing income disparity between Africa and the rest of the world which, in part, has arisen because of that continent's low share of world trade. During the recent negotiations on a new partnership agreement between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, Ireland argued strongly in favour of the EU's commitment to granting quota and duty free access to essentially all products from the least developed countries to the EU market by 2005. We hope to see this commitment translated into reality as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At the EU-Africa summit meeting in April this year, which was attended by the Taoiseach and Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, it was agreed that &ldquo;a new round of multilateral trade negotiations should take account of the particular constraints of developing countries, including those in Africa, and allow for their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy. In this context, we agree to co-operate so as to ensure that in the framework of multilateral trade negotiations special attention will be paid to products, including processed agricultural products, which are of export interest to developing countries, in particular Africa.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to supporting the needs of the developing countries is evidenced in that we were among the first countries to sign, at the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle last December, an agreement to establish an advisory centre on WTO law for Developing Countries in Geneva. The agreement was signed on our behalf by Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who led Ireland's delegation at the conference. Ireland thus became a founder member of the centre and we will contribute $2.25 million to it over five <Col N="727" /> years. The centre will provide invaluable advice and assistance for developing countries &ndash; in particular the least developed &ndash; in defending their trade rights and availing of the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO. In supporting this project we have underlined in a practical way our view that the Millennium Trade Round should reflect closely the needs and interests of the developing world and should facilitate the integration of developing countries into the world trade system.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the Government's proposals with regard to the reform of the United Nations and especially in regard to the composition of the Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16853/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In the recent review of the action programme, the Government committed itself to support the strengthening of the capacity of the international community, in particular through the UN and the renewal process that will follow the millennium assembly, to make effective humanitarian interventions to halt conflict and suffering.</P>
      <P>The reform issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government. It was raised again by Ireland in the general debate in the UN General Assembly on 25 September 1999. While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the millennium summit and assembly later this year will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN Development Assistance Framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will co-operate more closely at country <Col N="728" /> level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
    <P>The Track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the secretary-general and the creation of a new post of deputy secretary-general with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the UN Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost-cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit to the United Nations in April, I had meetings with both Deputy Secretary-General Frechette and the current President of the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia. During these meetings, I reiterated Ireland's support for the Secretary-General's reform efforts.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged Council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the Council for 2001-2.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, <Col N="729" /> involving greater consultation by the Council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary-General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the Council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret the working group has not yet been able to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government consider that the 14 member states who are applying the measures announced on 31 January in respect of Austria should now reflect on ways to resolve the situation. The Government has made it views known to the Portuguese Presidency which is currently consulting partners. We have encouraged the Presidency to continue in its efforts to move this issue forward while recognising that the issue remains a very sensitive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent letter from Chancellor Schussel proposing treaty changes in respect of Articles dealing with the violation by a member state of basic principles has been briefly considered at the current intergovernmental conference negotiations. We will continue to discuss with partners the merits of the proposal. However, as any treaty changes resulting from the Intergovernmental Conference will not be agreed before December with subsequent ratification by the member states likely to take at least a further year, the proposals <Col N="730" /> from Austria, and others, would not appear to offer an immediate solution to the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains very concerned at the situation in Chechnya. Guerilla warfare continues, both in the southern mountains and in the Chechen capital, Grozny.</P>
      <P>At the centre of our concerns are the innocent civilians who have been caught up in this conflict. It is estimated that approximately 20,000 civilians remain in Grozny. Over 185,000 Chechens are still in the neighbouring Russian Republic of Ingushetia. Ireland has allocated IR£310,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen internally displaced persons, to augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of £7.4 million. We will continue to do everything possible to alleviate the plight of civilians.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov, both bilaterally and as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe from last November to May. At these meetings I have continually stressed the need for political dialogue with elected Chechen representatives; the importance of a speedy deployment, with Russian security guarantees, of the Council of Europe experts seconded to the office of Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, Mr. Kalamanov; and the need for a credible and transparent investigation of allegations of human rights abuses and effective procedures to bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters were discussed by the committee of Ministers with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov in Strasbourg on 11 May, and I reported on the discussion and on Minister Ivanov's commitments to the Standing Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Dublin on 16 May. The issues of Russia's compliance with the fundamental human rights standards of the Council of Europe, and its progress in initiating political dialogue leading to a cease-fire, will be on the agenda of the next session of the Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg on 26-30 June, when the Committee of Ministers will <Col N="731" /> present its reply to recommendations 1444 and 1456.</P>
    <P>As yet, there is little sign of political dialogue commencing. However, Russia has now established direct administration over Chechnya, and has appointed Mr. Akhmad Kadyrov, a Muslim cleric, to head this administration.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to support efforts by the international community to promote a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The EU has repeatedly emphasised to Russia the seriousness with which it views the situation in Chechnya. There have been a number of high-level discussions of the issue with the Russian authorities, including at the EU-Russia Summit on 29 May. The OSCE Assistance Mission is to return to the region shortly and 62 OSCE monitors have been deployed on the Chechnya-Georgia border to prevent conflict spillover. Both the return of the OSCE Assistance Mission and the deployment of Council of Europe experts have been delayed by the security situation, but I understand that Russia hopes to make progress on this matter in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I will keep the House informed of further developments.</P>

Projects supported by the task force should reach a mass audience, and the material or outcome should be readily understood by an audience with little familiarity with European matters. Projects should have some element of added value, should have a measurable impact, and should be relatively modest in scale. Initiatives approved and in hand so far in 2000 include: support for the CD-ROM project for schools; support for Europe Week; and support for the Eurolink provincial newspaper columns on EU issues.</P>

      <P>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear arms reductions and nuclear disarmament. Any step which would undermine this treaty could result in a resumption of the nuclear arms race. It was with this perspective in mind that Ireland last autumn supported a resolution which underlined the need to uphold this treaty.</P>
      <P>At the recently concluded sixth review conference of the states parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the states parties emphasised the need to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons, in accordance with its provisions.</P>

We strongly hope that the outcome of these negotiations will not result in an erosion of the ABM Treaty or the principles on which it is based. Attempts by one or other nuclear weapon state to achieve invulnerability would be counterproductive and could lead to a new arms race. The nuclear weapon states have recently committed themselves unequivocally to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states parties are committed under article VI of the NPT. This is the route on which they must proceed.</P>

The summit's overall theme will be &ldquo;The Role of the UN in the twenty-first century&rdquo;. The Secretary-General presented his report for the millennium summit to the General Assembly on 3 April. The report entitled &ldquo;We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century&rdquo; is intended to facilitate preparations of member states for the forthcoming millennium summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary-General has identified some of the pressing challenges faced by the world's population and he proposes a number of immediate priorities for consideration at the summit <Col N="734" /> itself. Heads of State and Government are urged to take action in areas such as poverty, water, debt relief, education, HIV-AIDS, slum clearance, youth employment and information technology. The Secretary-General also urges the summit to make special provision for the needs of Africa, and to fully support Africans in their struggle to overcome the continent's problems. In addition, the Secretary-General calls for a renewed focus on conflict prevention and disarmament and on respect for international law. The adoption of a new ethic of conservation and stewardship of the environment is also identified as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General's report highlights a number of key international development targets focused on the alleviation of extreme poverty. He also calls on the heads of State and Government to ensure that the process of globalisation, which will characterise the first decade of the new millennium, benefits all people and does not exacerbate existing international inequalities. Two issues of particular importance identified in the report are the potentially disastrous consequences of the unchecked spread of the HIV-AIDS pandemic, particularly in sub Saharan Africa and the need for action to overcome the growing divide between developed and developing countries in the use of information technology.</P>
    <P>In our view, the report offers a broad and ambitious agenda for consideration in the lead-up to, and during, the summit. It identifies the challenges facing world leaders at the dawn of the new millennium. In particular, it seeks to foster international support for concerted action to reduce the current unacceptable level of extreme poverty, particularly in Africa. These objectives are fully shared by the Government. We will work to ensure the success of the summit which should, in our view, produce, a short, political and action oriented outcome designed to carry forward the agenda identified by the Secretary-General.</P>

      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the Western European and Others group of states for the two-year term 2001-2002. The election, which will take place at the UN General Assembly in October, is being contested by two other candidates: Norway and Italy. Turkey withdrew its candidacy in February 2000. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of <Col N="735" /> those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government have, where appropriate, raised Ireland's Security Council candidacy in contacts with other administrations. I have raised the candidacy in my contacts with other foreign ministers.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will be aware that, since this is a strongly contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say simply that our candidacy continues to attract a high level of support.</P>

    <P>A list of election observers has been forwarded to the Deputy. Requests to Ireland for observers may come from a variety of sources, for example, the European Union or the United Nations, through the United Nations Volunteers or the United Nations Development Programme. In these cases, APSO assists in identifying suitable personnel. Increasingly, also, observers requested by the European Union have been funded under EU joint actions and APSO's role is to identify suitable personnel. Requests are channelled through the Department and are, therefore, not identified separately in the attached list.</P>
    <P>Separately from the above, five members of the Oireachtas went to Cambodia in 1998 to observe the elections there. The team was funded on that occasion under the human rights and democratis<Col N="736" /> ation budget line of the Vote for international co-operation administered by the Department.</P>
    <P>APSO operates very strict procedures for the recruitment of election observers. The agency maintains a register of personnel from which potential observers are recruited. Applicants for inclusion on the register are obliged to attend an interview and are expected to fulfil at least one of two criteria, i.e. previous overseas experience and/or previous election experience over and above having voted. Interviews for inclusion on the register take place twice a year.</P>
    <P>On receipt of a request to provide observers, personnel are selected from the register on the basis of the following criteria: immediate knowledge of the country concerned; knowledge of the language; and knowledge of the area. It is also APSO policy to maintain a gender balance wherever possible and to field a mix of more experienced personnel and those new to the register.</P>

      <P>The sixth review conference of the states parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty concluded on 19 May 2000 with the adoption of a final document, in which the goals set by Ireland along with its new agenda partners in the 1998 Dublin Declaration were achieved. In particular, the final document includes an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament to which all state or parties are committed under Article VI of the treaty.</P>
      <P>The final document includes a detailed agenda for the next steps in nuclear disarmament, including the commencement at the conference on disarmament in Geneva of negotiations on a fissionable material cut-off treaty which will halt the production of fissile material for weapons purposes for all time. Certain new principles have also been established in the final document, including the application of the principle of irreversibility to nuclear disarmament measures and increased transparency by the nuclear weapon states with regard to their nuclear weapons capabilities.</P>
      <P>There have been far reaching undertakings regarding concrete measures to further reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, and a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimise the risk of these weapons ever being used. The question of reductions in non-strategic nuclear weapons has also been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, agreement has been reached to <Col N="737" /> deal with nuclear disarmament at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. In this context the states parties agreed to develop further the verification capabilities that will be required to provide assurance of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapon free world.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the agreements reached at the sixth review conference is now a matter for all of the states parties to the treaty. This work will be carried out as appropriate bilaterally, plurilaterally and multilaterally at the relevant UN and other international fora. The seventh review conference in 2005 will review the progress reached. Ireland will continue to contribute to this work.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my predecessor's replies to her previous questions regarding Canning's Lane, on 30 November and 27 January 1999, and on 9 June and 28 April 1998. I sympathise with the concerns of local residents in Muff, County Donegal that the section of Canning's Lane, off Coney Road, which lies in Northern Ireland, has not yet been fully opened.</P>
      <P>We have, on numerous occasions, conveyed our concern to the authorities in Northern Ireland that the section of this cross-Border road which lies in Northern Ireland has not yet been fully opened. As previously pointed out, a number of significant obstacles to its reopening have been overcome with the formal assertion by Derry City Council of the public right of way over the road and the acceptance by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment that it had responsibility for upgrading the road to highway standard.</P>
      <P>This issue is now the responsibility of the Department of Regional Development and is currently the subject of discussion between Derry City Council, the Department of Regional Development and the legal representatives of the landowner.</P>
      <P>The Department has again raised this issue with the appropriate authorities and is awaiting a response. I will make the detail available to the Deputy as soon as a response is received.</P>

    <P>The current restructuring of CE, which was decided by the Government in 1999 in consultation with the social partners, involves a phased reduction in the number of participants engaged on CE to 28,000 in 2003.

The outcome of these discussions will be considered by the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting in the above context that the Department of Education and Science is providing additional <i>per capita</i> grants to national schools in respect of secretarial and caretaking services during 2000, and that all schools will receive a grant in respect of secretarial and caretaking assistance by 2001.</P>

      <P>The Order restoring power to the Executive and the Assembly in the North entered into force on 30 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Assembly and Executive have responsibility for all matters relating to Northern Ireland except for those which are excepted or reserved under the Northern Ireland Act, 1999, the British legislation giving effect to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. Currently, Ministers of the Executive oversee ten government departments: Agriculture; Culture, Arts and Leisure; Education; Enterprise, Trade and Investment; Environment; Finance and Personnel; Health, Social Services and Public Safety; Higher and <Col N="741" /> Further Education, Training and Employment; Regional Development; and Social Development.</P>
    <P>The North/South Ministerial Council was established on 2 December 1999 and held its first plenary meeting in Armagh on 13 December. Given the absence of Northern Ministers, it was unable to meet while the Executive was suspended. It has now resumed its full operation and the next meeting of the Council, to discuss matters relating to the Special EU Programmes Implementation Body, is scheduled to take place in Dublin on Friday, 16 June 2000. A further eight meetings of the Council to discuss the agreed areas of co-operation and the on-going work of the implementation bodies are scheduled to take place before the summer break. Arrangements are also being made to hold the second Plenary Meeting of the Council, which is due to take place in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Government raises cases of concern in Northern Ireland through the framework of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference. As provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, the conference addresses, in particular, &ldquo;the areas of rights, justice, prisons and policing in Northern Ireland&rdquo;. The Government regularly raises alleged human rights abuses and any concerns about the behaviour of members of the RUC with the British Government through this framework.</P>
      <P>Persons with concerns about such issues may also raise them directly through a number of mechanisms. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints is currently tasked with supervising complaints made by the public against members of the police. The Commission will be replaced this autumn by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland who will have a broader range of powers. Alleged human rights abuses may of course, also be raised with the Human Rights Commission for Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Horn of Africa continues to be of concern. The drought and consequent food shortages affecting the region due to three consecutive years of poor rainfall have left 16 million people in need of assistance. Pastoral areas of the sub-region, including south-eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and several parts of Somalia, have been particularly affected.</P>
      <P>However, there is now a sustained international effort under way, under the leadership of the United Nations, to address the needs. The UN launched an emergency consolidated appeal for the region last week, seeking $377 million to tackle food shortages as well as provide medicine, safe water, food and livestock. The appeal covers 13.4 million people in the five most affected countries, namely Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Kenya. With the launch of the appeal, the United Nations country teams in each of these countries are increasing their capacity to deal with the emergency. It is generally agreed that the effects of the drought can be contained if the required resources are committed in time. These resources are relatively modest compared to what would be needed if the current crisis were allowed to degenerate into widespread famine. The international response to the needs identified in January has been generous with much of the food needed being pledged. It is hoped that a similarly generous response will be forthcoming in light of this emergency appeal.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ethiopia, the delivery of emergency food continues. As of 6 June, 86% of the 836,000 mt of food aid for 7.7 million people requested by the Ethiopian government in January had been resourced. The food is being channelled through WFP, NGOs and by direct pledges to the government. During the Minister of State's recent visit to Ethiopia, she was assured that sufficient food was pledged by the international community to meet the needs identified in January. However, with the new UN appeal the numbers requiring assistance have been revised upwards.</P>
      <P>Ireland has played its part in ensuring that the needs of the vulnerable people are addressed and in ensuring that all necessary measures are taken to alleviate hunger in this part of the world. I have raised the issue at the EU General Affairs Council and the Minister of State has been actively involved in raising awareness of the severity of the crisis through her visit to Ethiopia. The Minister of State has availed of every opportunity to press for the necessary measures to be taken to alleviate the suffering of the people of the Horn of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While logistical problems hampered the relief programme in the beginning, in particular in relation to providing sufficient food aid to Ethi<Col N="743" /> opia, those problems are now being addressed. The capacity of Djibouti port, through which the majority of food aid for Ethiopia is routed, has been increased and additional trucks made available to the relief effort. Measures have been taken to maintain the roads both from the ports to the primary distribution centres and from there to the regions. The UN World Food Programme has established a logistics cell in cooperation with the government's technical coordination committee to supervise and guide the logistics operation, port management and ship scheduling, and short and long haul trucking. As part of efforts to ensure the successful provision of adequate humanitarian assistance to those affected by the drought, the current UN appeal is seeking funding for a large-scale logistics operation including common transport, communications and safety systems in the region.</P>
    <P>The Ethiopian Emergency Food Security Reserve was created in 1992 as a means of ensuring that sufficient food would be available in-country to address any food shortages that may arise. In the intervening years the Government of Ethiopia has, with the help of donors, including the EU, built up the capacity of the EFSR so that there is now the potential to store 400,000 mt of food in-country. While the EFSR stocks were somewhat depleted earlier this year, the international community has begun to replenish them, thus ensuring food can be prepositioned in remote areas before the expected arrival of the July rains. WFP and the Ethiopian Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Committee hope to preposition approximately 77,000 mt of food in seriously-affected and difficult to access areas before the end of June. The creation of the EFSR is one of a number of measures being put in place to build local capacities and therefore to mitigate and prevent similar levels of distress from recurrent drought conditions in this part of the world.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has been consistent in its support for those suffering throughout the region. In the case of Ethiopia, since December 1999, £1,333,000 from the emergency humanitarian aid budget has been committed to address the crisis. This money has been channelled through the UN world food programme and the Irish NGOs Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. In addition, £2 million from the Ireland Aid budget for long-term development projects in Ethiopia has been re-orientated to emergency relief, bringing Ireland's total contribution in response to the crisis in Ethiopia to £3,333,000. In Eritrea, a total of £250,000 has been allocated to WFP since last December. Funds have also been contributed to address the needs in Northern Kenya, with £107,400 being disbursed through WFP and the Holy Ghost Fathers. In Somalia, where over six hundred and fifty thousand people are experiencing severe food and water shortages, the Government has disbursed £340,000 through WFP, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Trócaire for drought relief projects. In total <Col N="744" /> £4,030,400 has been contributed by the Irish Government to assist in the drought relief effort in the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the situation of Kosovo Albanians detained in Serbia since the end of the Kosovo conflict last year. I have received a number of representations about the issue of missing Kosovo Albanians and am following the issue closely.</P>
      <P>Estimates vary on the number of missing persons detained in Serbia. The Serbian authorities have published two lists of 2,300 being held. International bodies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and several key human rights groups believe that the overwhelming majority of those missing beyond that number are dead. Investigators from the International Court of Justice for the former Yugoslavia are currently trying to identify remains of bodies found in mass graves. This may account for a large number of cases of missing persons.</P>
      <P>Given the lack of cooperation from the Serbian authorities the most effective way for Ireland and other EU countries without diplomatic representation in Belgrade is to work towards the release of Kosovo Albanians detained in Serbia through international agencies such as the ICRC or the UN High Commission for Human Rights. Ireland has directly supported the work of the ICRC in Serbia. There is also a handful of courageous Belgrade &ndash; based lawyers from the Humanitarian Law Centre, the Yugoslav Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and other organisations concerned with human rights violations by the Belgrade regime who have defended Kosovo Albanians brought before the Serbian courts. These deserve international, and particularly EU support.</P>
      <P>Recently the Head of UNMIK &ndash; United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo &ndash; Mr. Bernard Kouchner, has proposed a number of initiatives on the prisoner issue and has appealed for support from EU Foreign Ministers. These initiatives included: organising a hearing of the associations of the families of those detained at the EU Council; promoting the establishment of an independent committee, including well known international personalities, to monitor the trials of those detained in Serbia; and support cooperation projects targeted at providing psychological and economic support to the families of prisoners and missing persons.</P>
      <P>I am certainly willing to look at these initiatives and support them in any way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of missing persons and prisoners rep<Col N="745" /> resents a huge emotional strain for the Kosovo Albanian population and carries political implications for the relationship between ethnic groups inside Kosovo. Members of the Albanian community will not tolerate the return of Serb refugees to their homes inside the province, as long as the issue of prisoners inside Serbia remains unresolved. For the sake of promoting social cohesion and stability inside Kosovo, as well as for a concern for the cause of human rights generally, this is an issue which the international community must resolve.</P>

      <P>The humanitarian situation in Kosovo has improved dramatically in the past six months for the Kosovar Albanian population. Rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts have made tremendous progress under the supervision and coordination of the United Nations Administration in Kosovo. There are still, however, significant needs to be met in Kosovo and in the Balkans as a whole. The government is aware of these needs and is committed to working with the rest of the international community toward addressing humanitarian issues as they currently stand and meeting the needs of the region as a whole with regard to economic growth and political stability.</P>
      <P>However, the continuing political instability and the pervasiveness of ethnic division in the province has meant that the dispossessed of Kosovo are now members of the non-Albanian population who are leaving the province, often as a direct consequence of intimidation. It is in this context that political stability in the region can be seen as the crucial factor in creating an environment where rehabilitation assistance is sustainable in the long-term.</P>
      <P>The Government has pledged to provide a minimum of IR£1 million in rehabilitation assistance to Kosovo in 2000. This is in addition to the IR£6 million spent in 1999 in humanitarian assistance to Kosovo and Kosovar refugees. These funds are being directed at the areas of greatest need within Kosovo such as housing, infrastructure rehabilitation and education. The level of international assistance directed at the province should ensure that these needs will be definitively met in the short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through the EU, has also contributed to the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, the organisation with primary responsibility for reconstruction efforts in the province. The establishment of the agency has brought advantages in terms of efficiency, speed, visibility-transparency and decentralisation. The agency has already begun programmes which will <Col N="746" /> assist the effort to rebuild and improve the quality of life in Kosovo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The response of the international community to the crisis in Mozambique resulting from the floods of February-March of this year has been centred on a short-term emergency relief in response to the appeal of the Government of Mozambique for $1000 million to meet immediate needs and medium-term rehabilitation assistance based on the appeal at the International Reconstruction Conference for Mozambique held in Rome on 3 and 4 May in which the Government of Mozambique sought $US 449.5 million in international support for its reconstruction programme. Both of these financing targets were met by the international community.</P>
      <P>The emergency phase, involving assistance to those affected to return to their normal life by, for example, providing housing materials, seeds and farming implements, is expected to conclude in August 2000. The reconstruction phase, using the funds raised at the conference in Rome, is expected to last until the end of the year 2001. The Government of Mozambique is determined that the infrastructure damaged by the floods should be restored and, importantly, that preventive measures be taken to mitigate the effects of any future natural disasters.</P>
      <P>In addition to the immediate £700,000 emergency relief provided by Ireland, a further IR£1.6 million was reallocated from the budget for long-term development projects in Mozambique to meet short-term needs arising from the emergency. Furthermore an amount of IR£4.5 million was pledged by Ireland at an international donor conference held in Rome last month for the reconstruction process. IR£1.7 million of this amount is for payment to the debt alleviation fund established by the Government and will help to relieve the burden of debt on the country. The remaining IR£2.8 million will be used for the rehabilitation of roads washed away in the flood affected province of Inhambane where Ireland has had a development programme since 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the reconstruction process, Mozambique has prepared its strategy for mid and long-term development, which is vital if it is to return to the impressive 10% growth rates achieved in the past four years. The Government reiterated its commitment to macro-economic stability and poverty reduction. Most Mozambicans still live in poverty, illiteracy and vulnerability to disease and it remains one of the worlds' poorest countries. At a World Bank consultative <Col N="747" /> group meeting in Paris on 8 and 9 June 2000, between the Government of Mozambique and its international development partners, additional sums of $530 million for 2000 and $560 million for 2001 were pledged. At this meeting Ireland pledged £7.4 million for the year 2000 and indicated an intention to allocate increased amounts in subsequent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following closely developments in relation to East Timor. The issue was discussed by Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg last Tuesday 13 June, when the head of UNTAET, Mr. Sergio de Mello, provided a briefing on the latest developments. While his assessment did not underestimate the size of the tasks remaining, particularly in the area of nation building and the formation of a tolerant society, it was overall positive.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor with the support of the international community, is working in close consultation with the National Consultative Council, which comprises East Timor representatives from various political streams, to develop indigenous capacity for the day that East Timor will be independent and in charge of its own affairs. This role of UNTAET is complementary to the one which it also has in providing security and overseeing reconstruction and economic development. The sum total of the work constitutes a complex process, where progress can be seen under the different headings, although not in an entirely uniform way, and where difficulties still exist in respect of refugee returns and increasing violence and criminal activity.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that UNTAET is trying to develop local capacity as quickly as possible, and in several instances this has to be built from a very low base. There is also local impatience at the slow speed of progress in some areas. The challenge therefore for UNTAET is to decide the degree and speed of handing over its responsibilities in each case, so that its work can be continued in a sustainable way. To address this challenge plans are currently being prepared for a greater &ldquo;Timorisation&rdquo; of the overall process, including a form of co-government in which international persons and East Timorese ministers would serve together in a cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major landmark along the road to independence will be free elections, which are expected to be held in 2001. These elections will lead to the establishment of a constituent assembly, which in turn will draft, debate and adopt a constitution. Following the adoption of <Col N="748" /> the constitution, it is expected that the constituent assembly will become the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Against this background there have also been some further recent positive developments. The Front for the Liberation of East Timor, FRETILIN, the long-standing pro-independence party, recently held a series of regional conferences followed by a national party congress of which the main theme was the need to replace the political infighting of the past with democratic practices and pluralism. It is also hoped that the UN Secretary General will be in a position by August to give a clear timetable for the move toward independence. Should that happen it could be considered by a general meeting of the National Council for Timorese Resistance which will also take place at that time.</P>
    <P>A further examination of progress in East Timor will be carried out at a donors' conference which will be held in Lisbon on 22 and 23 June and which Ireland will be attending.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to contributing to the work of capacity and nation-building, with particular concentration on the development of a legal system. I expect this work to continue when we open our aid office in Dili later this year.</P>

      <P>The international community has been carefully following developments in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>One year ago on 29 May 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated as the first democratically elected civilian President of Nigeria following 15 years of military rule. In a message marking the first anniversary of Nigeria's return to democracy last month, the Secretary-General of the United Nations referred to the successful return to democratic government in the continent's most populous country as a significant landmark in Africa's quest for political stability and economic progress. Secretary-General Annan went on to praise President Obasanjo's personal commitment to the promotion of democracy in Africa and his work to revive the Nigerian economy and restore integrity and sound leadership to the country.</P>
      <P>Since coming to power, the President and his Government have faced a number of challenges in restoring the country to full democracy, including in relation to political and economic issues.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, had an opportunity to discuss this and other issues during their meeting with President Obasanjo on the occasion of the first Africa-Europe Summit in Cairo in April this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in certain parts of northern Nigeria, and the efforts by some state authorities to extend it, have exacerbated ethnic and religious <Col N="749" /> tensions there. Tensions in the Niger Delta region are also a cause for concern, as is the recent disruption caused by the nationwide strike protesting against the increase in fuel prices.</P>
    <P>We welcome the positive initiatives taken by President Obasanjo to date, and with our EU partners and other members of the international community we will continue to work to promote political and economic reforms and to co-operate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria remains a cause for concern, even if improvements are taking place. At the recent 56th session of the UN Commission of Human Rights, Ireland together with our EU partners, welcomed a number of positive developments in Algeria and signs of co-operation by the Government of Algeria with its international partners. In response to representations by the EU, the Algerian authorities have furnished information to the EU Presidency about a number of disappearance cases. They have undertaken to follow up with further information and have advised the presidency that they have undertaken to keep the Commission of Human Rights informed on a regular basis about cases of persons reported to have disappeared in Algeria. It is clearly important that these assurances are kept.</P>
      <P>Algeria has committed itself to the democratisation and reform process. Algeria's constitution of 1996 guarantees basic human rights, including an independent judiciary. Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, including the international covenant on civil and political rights, on economic, social and cultural rights and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the EU are encouraging Algeria to honour these commitments and persevere with necessary economic and social reforms and modernisation and improvements in human rights, particularly in the context of Algeria's Barcelona Process commitments, under which concrete constructive assistance is being provided. In this context, the moves by President Bouteflika's Government towards economic and social modernisation and reform, though currently in a delicate phase and resisted by some elements, can provide the basis for a peaceful future for Algeria. Full respect for human rights will be an essential element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the stated readiness of the Algerian Government to engage with human rights groups and continue to call for full and effective <Col N="750" /> co-operation with UN mechanisms, and in particular for access for UN special rapporteurs. A 12 day mission to Algeria by Amnesty International last month found a clear improvement in human rights, but added that it was still too soon to draw a definitive conclusion. The four person mission met with leading Algerian Government officials and local human rights leaders and travelled to the interior of the country to speak with witnesses.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the government amnesty by the Islamic Salvation Front &ndash; FIS &ndash; whose military wing the Islamic Salvation Army formally moved to disband under the agreement reached with the Government, is a positive move towards an end to years of conflict. Clearly further steps are necessary and it is important that all groups continue to work for the security, stability and reconciliation of the country. In this regard we remain deeply concerned by the continued activity of the Armed Islamic Group &ndash; GIA &ndash; which has been responsible for atrocities often involving massacre and mutilation.</P>

      <P>The Government strongly holds the view, which is also shared by our EU partners, that progress will only be made towards democracy when the military regime in Burma enters into meaningful dialogue with Madam Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy. To this end the EU has suggested initial practical steps and confidence building measures in order to persuade the military regime to engage in this dialogue. To explain this approach the EU has offered to send a second troika mission to Rangoon. The response of the regime to this offer is still awaited.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a continuing failure by the regime to bring about essential change and to improve the appalling situation in the country would be condemned by the international community. The regime must address the findings of various UN and other inquiries or face further sanctions. Such measures should avoid to the greatest extent possible adding to the suffering of the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The effect of the strengthened restrictive measures which the EU introduced in April against the military regime as well as their response to the offer of a second troika mission are being kept under close examination and policy will be reviewed as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also availing of every opportunity in meetings with Foreign Ministers from the region to explain my thinking and to encourage them to adopt a similar approach. In the meantime we <Col N="751" /> will continue to offer support in the form of facilities and training to Burmese democratic parties.</P>

      <P>The speed with which the international community responds to emergency situations and provides relief to those in need has been tested on a number of occasions in the recent months. Flooding in Mozambique, drought in the Horn of Africa and landslides in Venezuela generated a rapid international response to assist those in crisis. The key to an effective and timely response by the international community to emergency situations is a co-ordinated and collective approach to the provision of assistance. A number of international humanitarian agencies exist which individually and working together facilitate a speedy response to disasters. These include UN agencies such as the UN High Commission for Refugees, the World Food Programme and UNICEF, the Red Cross Family and non-governmental organisations. These agencies have rapid response mechanisms in place.</P>
      <P>As part of the reform programme of the UN, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs &ndash; OCHA &ndash; was established in 1998. OCHA was mandated by the member states to mobilize and co-ordinate the collective efforts of the international community, in particular those of the UN system, to meet the needs of those suffering the effects of humanitarian emergencies. OCHA, with the strong support of donor countries, including Ireland, co-ordinates the overall response, identifies gaps, avoids duplication and unnecessary competition among aid agencies which, unfortunately, still occurs all too frequently.</P>
      <P>OCHA has a number of mechanisms through which countries respond collectively to sudden onset emergencies. These include a resource base for UN disaster assessment and co-ordination, UNDAC, teams consisting of 140 skilled emergency managers from 32 countries and international organisations. UNDAC teams have trained together and are fully self-sufficient and available to be sent immediately to disaster situations.</P>
      <P>OCHA also has a military and civil defence unit to ensure the most efficient use of military and civil defence assets in support of humanitarian emergencies. Military and civil defence assets can only be employed at the request, or with the consent of the receiving state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the ability of the <Col N="752" /> international community to respond speedily, efficiently and effectively to emergencies has improved qualitatively in recent years. However, it is equally recognised that continued efforts are needed to build and consolidate the achievements to date and to learn lessons from each humanitarian intervention. The focus must always remain on saving and protecting the lives of those most affected. Ireland has been participating actively in international efforts led by the UN to improve the speed and effectiveness of emergency response. Supporting the efforts of developing countries to prevent and mitigate disasters is also a key concern.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a substantial level of complaints recently about aircraft noise from the residents of the north Dublin area. This has been caused by the effects of improvement works to the main runway at Dublin Airport which have led to the closure of that runway on week nights. This resulted in increased night use of the secondary runway while the main runway was closed. It is expected that these improvement works will be completed within a couple of weeks. The main runway will then be restored to full service on a 24 hour basis, which will end the increased night use of the secondary runway and hence alleviate the noise problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to the issue of having military service allowance, included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces' personnel who retired before 1 August 1990. The person referred to is in this category.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of MSA in the calculation of superannuation benefits for military personnel arose from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson commission. The agreed arrangements for the implementation of the recommendation provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, that is, the day following publication of the commission's report. MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified persons who retired since that date.</P>
      <P>The various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990, were fully considered in the context of the detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations which preceded the implementation of the recommendation of the Gleeson commission. However, having regard to the practice followed in other areas of the public service and the considerable cost involved, which is not confined to my Department alone, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to those who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a core element of public service pensions parity policy that, when an allowance is being <Col N="754" /> made pensionable for serving personnel, the benefit does not apply to existing pensioners. Accordingly, the stance adopted on the pensionability of MSA is consistent with settled pensions policy in the public service generally.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to my coming into office, I met representatives of the Association for Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO. I listened carefully and sympathetically to their views on this issue and undertook to have the matter re-examined. I was very conscious, however, that the situation regarding pre-August, 1990 Defence Forces pensioners involved fundamental issues of policy and cost, which are not confined to my Department alone. While my Department initiated this re-examination, it became clear that it would be inappropriate to proceed any further pending the publication of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions was established by the Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The commission has very broad terms of reference to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits. It was open to individuals and groups to make submissions to the commission and I understand ARCO together with the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women and the Irish UN Veterans Association, were among various pensioners' groups to do so.</P>
    <P>The commission is an independent body and is expected to make its final report to Government in the near future. In its interim report, published in November 1997, the commission lists the pensionability of allowances generally as one of the main issues raised by various interested parties which made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard. The position of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners in the MSA context will be further considered in the light of the final report of the commission and of any relevant Government decisions thereon.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value, that is, the rental value of the property. The factors that determine rental value include the operations of the property market, changes in economic conditions, the profitability of business, royalties or tolls received and changes or developments to property. A central tenet of the rating valuation code is uniformity and equity between ratepayers.</P>
      <P>The owner or occupier of any property, the rating authority or a representative of the Commissioner of Valuation can apply at any time to have the rateable valuation of any property revised. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a revised rateable valuation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the Valuation Tribunal. The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the commissioner and ratepayers or rating authorities. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
      <P>The property referred to in the details supplied is described in the valuation list as Quarry-Sandpit, Workshop and Land with £45 rateable valuation attributable to buildings and £440 rateable valuation attributable to the quarry-sandpit. The buildings rateable valuation of £45 dates from an agreement following an earlier appeal in 1992.</P>
      <P>Mayo County Council applied for a revision of the rateable valuation of the property in 1998. Following this revision a rateable valuation of £350 was ascribed to the quarry-sandpit element of the property. No change was made to the £45 rateable valuation attributable to the buildings. Agents acting for the occupier appealed the matter to the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
      <P>At appeal the commissioner increased the rateable valuation attributable to the quarry-sandpit to £440. This decision was subsequently appealed to the Valuation Tribunal. The tribunal heard the case on 12 April last and affirmed the rateable valuation of £440 and £45 for the quarry-sandpit and the buildings respectively. The Valuation Tribunal in arriving at its decision heard evidence from professional witnesses on both sides.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the House that it is an offence to use marked gas oil, commonly referred to as green diesel, in a motor vehicle. I have no plans therefore to allow the road haulage industry to use this product. The typical legitimate uses of green diesel are as follows: in vehicles or machinery, for example, agricultural machinery, including agricultural tractors, which do not come under the definition of a motor vehicle for excise purposes; in boats in inland waterways; for home heating purposes, and in stationary engines.</P>
      <P>The rebated rate of excise duty for green diesel is £37.30 per 1,000 litres, while the full rate of duty on diesel for automotive purposes is £256.14 per 1,000 litres.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the receipts from automotive diesel for the current year are estimated at £525 million. If the low rate of duty of £37.30 per 1,000 litres were to be applied to diesel used in the haulage trade, the loss to the Exchequer would be approximately £404 million in a full year on the assumption that in excess of 90% of all automotive diesel is used by goods vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marked oil offences are regarded seriously, as those committing the offences are defrauding the Exchequer of revenue which is properly payable. <Col N="758" /> In addition, the question of equity arises as between those persons who obey the law in this context and those who choose not to do so. This is particularly so in the case of commercial road users. For example, a road haulier who decides to break the law by using &ldquo;green diesel&rdquo; to fuel his vehicle has a competitive advantage over the haulier who operates within the law. In such circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners are committed to fully enforcing the law in this respect.</P>

      <P>The 1999 nurses' pay settlement contained a provision that the pay of promoted grades should be dealt with in a post Partnership 2000 setting. Notwithstanding this commitment, nurse managers benefited from considerable improvements in pay and related conditions of employment on foot of Labour Court recommendations.</P>
      <P>The commitment to address the pay of nurse managers in a post Partnership 2000 setting will now be progressed through the benchmarking body to be established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF.

It outlines the proposals for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. A project team, appointed by the chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board, with representation from my Department is currently preparing a brief for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group which will form the basis for instructing an architect and design team to advance the planned developments.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Eastern Regional Health Authority is responsible for the delivery of health services by St Ita's Hospital, Portrane. Some £13 million is being made available for the <Col N="761" /> development of new and refurbished facilities for persons with an intellectual disability currently accommodated in St Ita's hospital. This plan is being jointly funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of this project new residential and day services have been completed in Oldtown, County Dublin, and are currently being commissioned. This new facility will provide accommodation for 30 persons from the St. Ita's campus. The capital costs to date associated with this development are approximately £3 million with additional revenue costs of £0.6 million provided by my Department. The work of the project and design teams on an overall development control plan for the hospital campus, which includes new accommodation to be provided for the intellectual disability services, is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £3 million mentioned above, capital funding of £0.5 million in 1999 and a further £1 million this year have been allocated by my Department towards the costs associated with this development. It is anticipated that the planning and tendering process will be completed by early 2001 with building commencing on site towards the end of the first quarter of that year. The bulk of the expenditure will be incurred once this building work commences.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART and suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. A review of the free schemes was recently published by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children bringing this recommendation to their attention.</P>

      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. The intended outcomes of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help; that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities to help them assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a year all can gain. Individuals can find a renewed sense of purpose. Volunteer groups can be reinvigorated. Governments and the non-profit and private sectors can enter into fresh partnerships to make for greater participation, <Col N="765" /> alleviate problems and promote good governance.</P>
    <P>The UN year of the volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support volunteering. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established, with participation from relevant interests, which will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The committee will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be bringing a memorandum to the Government regarding the setting up of this committee and issues of structures, staffing and finance will be examined as part of this process. I know that various organisations involved in volunteering have already met to discuss how to make the most of IYV 2001. A number of organisations have already made submissions to my Department on IYV 2001. All of these submissions, including the one referred to by the Deputy, will be made available to the national committee on volunteering to assist them in their work.</P>

      <P>The National Library set up its new genealogical service in mid-1998 and has an ongoing programme of work to extend the range of materials available in the library for the purposes of genealogical research, including a new programme of microfilming of Catholic parish registers. Full details of these initiatives are given in the library's annual reports for 1998 and 1999. The 1999 report will shortly be available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the National Archives it is intended during this year to withdraw the original census returns for 1901 and 1911 from public access and to make microfilms of them available on a self-service basis instead. This will improve the quality of the service to the public, while also safeguarding the original records from further damage through excessive handling. The National Archives policy is to make duplicates of the microfilms available for purchase by county libraries, county genealogical centres and other institutions. Microfilms of the 1901 census returns are already available for purchase, and the microfilms of the 1911 census returns will also shortly be available for all counties. The National Archives office is investigating the feasibility of <Col N="768" /> adding copies of some of the most frequently used records to its website, but this will probably take some time to achieve. An index to wills held in the National Archives was published on CD &ndash; ROM by a private company earlier this year.  </P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it has not proved easy to identify the owners of Ballybunion Castle but Kerry County Council is making every effort to do so. The Heritage Council has been approached for assistance towards the conservation of the castle but it will not consider grant-aid until its ownership has been established and the structure has been put on their buildings at risk register.</P>
      <P>A meeting took place between officials of my Department and officials of Kerry County Council on 2 June 2000, to discuss the future of the castle. At that meeting it was agreed that Kerry Council should proceed to erect scaffolding around the castle so that it could be inspected jointly by representatives of my Department and of the council to determine what safety works are needed to safeguard the ruin. The emphasis at this stage must, of necessity, be on safety rather than restoration works. I have been informed by the county council that the scaffolding at Ballybunion Castle should be in place in early July.</P>

      <P>Carrigafoyle Castle is in State care having been placed in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works in 1937 by its then owner. Notification was received in the following year that the owner had died and that the new owner was resident in England. There has been no correspondence with the owner since then and, despite efforts in recent years to establish current ownership, this still remains uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by the Heritage Council <Col N="769" /> that Carrigafoyle Castle in not on its register of buildings at risk, but Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has recently undertaken a survey of the castle in order to establish its current condition. The preliminary results are now being examined and, as resources become available, it is proposed to undertake appropriate conservation works to facilitate safe access for visitors.</P>

      <P>It is not the general practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm, however, that the mother and stepfather requested that the child be reunited with them in this State. Following consultation with the applicants' legal representatives at that time agreement was obtained for officials of the asylum division of my Department to approach the Italian authorities in accordance with the terms of Article 12 of the Dublin Convention &ndash; the Dublin Convention is the mechanism by which it is determined which EU state is responsible for dealing with asylum applications. Article 12 of the Dublin Convention provides &ldquo;where an application for asylum is lodged with the competent authorities of a member state by an applicant who is on the territory of another member state, the determination of the member state responsible for examining the application for asylum shall be made by the member state on whose territory the applicant is. The latter member state shall be informed without delay by the member state which received the application and shall then, for the purpose of applying this convention, be regarded as the member state with which the application for asylum was lodged&rdquo;. In accordance with the terms of Article 12 it is a matter for the Italian authorities as to whether or not they <Col N="770" /> request us to take responsibility for the person concerned in this case. No such request has been received from the Italian authorities. On the basis of documentary evidence supplied to my Department it appears that the Italian authorities are satisfied that the child is residing with her legal guardians in Italy. The legal representatives of the mother and stepfather at that time were informed accordingly in a letter dated 23 November 1999.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that exhaustive enquiries have been carried out by my Department in order to ensure that all legal obligations under the Dublin Convention were properly adhered to in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium together with the review of that programme published in November 1999, contains the main objectives and priorities which have been set by the Government for the development of the tourism sector. I am satisfied that progress is being made in line with the commitments made.</P>
      <P>The objectives and strategies being pursued by my Department for the development of tourism are contained in the Statement of Strategy 1998-2001 published by my Department in May 1998, copies of which have already been circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, covering the period 2000-06, was published in November 1999. The plan sets out a range of specific proposals for the development of tourism and confirms a public investment package in excess of £350 million for tourism marketing, human resource development and product development.</P>
      <P>The package includes the creation of a multi-annual tourism marketing fund of £150 million over the life of the plan. In April 2000, a new tourism marketing partnership was agreed: this involves representatives of the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte working together to develop strategies for the totality of their combined annual marketing expenditure.</P>
      <P>Overseas visitor numbers reached a new all time high of six million in 1999, which was also a record year for tourism revenue, with foreign earnings expected to grow to £2.5 billion. The number of jobs supported by tourism increased to 135,000 in 1999 and tourism now accounts for one in 12 of the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>Our higher education institutions have statutory obligations to promote equality both in terms of gender equality and in terms of equality of opportunity for all sections of society. Accordingly, the goal of achieving equity in higher education is a central pillar of educational policy generally.</P>
      <P>In addition to the financial assistance available under the grant schemes for further and higher education, hearing impaired students attending courses in third level colleges-institutions and post leaving certificate centres may apply for assistance from the special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department. The purpose of the special fund is to provide grant assistance to students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated to the special fund has increased substantially each year from £80,000 in 1994 to £700,000 in 1999. Funding was allocated to a total of 314 applicants in 1999, including an allocation of £208,500 for 61 students with hearing impairments.</P>
      <P>For the current year, applications for assistance under the special fund will be received by my Department at the beginning of the 2000-01 academic year. Awards to individual students will be made from within the overall allocation for the alleviation of disadvantage at PLC-third level. This measure was introduced in 1994 with funding of £200,000 and the level of funding has been increased to £2.786 million in 1999, and to £3.428 million in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote equality of opportunity, <Col N="774" /> including access for students with disabilities, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. The 1999 allocation for HEA-funded targeted initiatives in the university sector relating to students with disabilities, including students with hearing impairments, was £539,000, which represents a significant increase on the allocation for 1998 of £400,000.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million to build on the existing arrangements to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications. It will, <i>inter alia, </i>meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services. Considerations are ongoing on the allocation for initiatives under this fund.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>Following its consultation with various interests in the field, the Higher Education Authority has submitted a report to my Department on the proposal to establish a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College Dublin. I have arranged for a copy of this report to be forwarded to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The authority concludes that there is a strong case for the establishment of the centre. I have previously indicated that I am favourably disposed to such a centre. However, a number of practical issues need further clarification and my officials have commenced discussions with the authority in this regard. These issues relate to the appropriate structure and financing for the centre, the implications for the overall budgetary provision, the question of possible overlaps with other initiatives and the need for co-ordination.</P>
      <P>I see this matter as a priority and will try to have it concluded as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is determined annually following discussions with the <Col N="776" /> managerial authorities and the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and five mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 165 at 30 September 1998. The enrolment at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 138. As the enrolment requirement for the retention of the fifth teacher is 150, I regret that this post must be suppressed at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have also examined this school's position in relation to its developing status. Sanction of a developing school post is conditional on a school satisfying specific criteria. A school which has less than 298 pupils is required to increase its enrolment by 25 pupils in one school year relative to the previous school year, and must exceed the point at which the next assistant's post is due to the school by a minimum of five pupils. Correspondence from the school has shown a projected enrolment of 153 for September 2000, which, unfortunately, is insufficient for the appointment of a developing school post.</P>

      <Quest>the number of schools which will lose community employment schemes; his views on whether schools can cope without the assistance of community employment schemes; and the steps, if any, he will take to mitigate the effects on schools of the loss of such schemes.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As responsibility for the operation of the community employment schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am not in a position to provide the details sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of schools involved. Neither am I in a position to comment on the possible effects on schools where such schemes are not renewed. I can, however, assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and sec<Col N="777" /> retarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that, with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There is also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the Vocational Education Committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
    <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present arrangements, children with autism have access to a range of educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case. These supports include resource teaching support in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special classes in primary schools and teaching support in special schools.</P>
      <P>Each special class, which operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1, also receives the support of a special needs assistant, enhanced capitation and funding towards equipment needs.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have information on the number of children with autism and their age, currently receiving education support. However, since my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism, in November 1998, a total of 24 special classes have been established in primary schools. These classes can cater for up to 144 pupils with autism.</P>
      <P>There are also thirty one teaching posts allocated to special schools to cater for pupils with autism. These posts can cater for a total of 186 pupils with autism.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer the Deputy to the following schedule, which shows the location of the primary and special schools where my Department has sanctioned special classes for pupils with autism.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional classes for pupils with autism in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We are also supporting pilot pre-school provision in three locations, two in Dublin, north and south city, and one in Cork. These pre-school classes are catering for 24 children with autism.</P>
      <P>The recently published White Paper on Early Childhood Education sets out the proposed framework for the future development of early education services, including services for children with special needs. My Department has recently completed a range of discussions with interested parties in relation to service development in early childhood education and proposals to advance the measures set out in the White Paper are now being considered.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced my intention to establish a task force on autism to examine models of provision for children with this condition and to make recommendations for the future development of services in this area.</P>

    <P>As there is only one eligible child from the Coolcullen area offering for transport to Muckalee national school, I regret that it is not open to my Department to sanction the establishment of a transport service to this school.</P>

      <P>The pupil referred to by the Deputy is currently receiving remedial teacher support. In addition, my Department has sanctioned three hours resource teacher support per week to cater for his special educational needs.</P>
      <P>At present, there is a vacancy in the visiting teacher service for the Kilkenny-south Tipperary. I understand that an existing visiting teacher will transfer into this area with effect from 1 September 2000. Attempts by my Department to fill the post in a temporary capacity in the interim were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating whether additional special support is warranted for the pupil in question. Upon receipt of the inspector's report, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities in relation to this matter.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in County Cork, who is dyslexic and is currently undertaking his leaving certificate examination, will get special consideration in the marking of his examination papers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware I have expanded considerably the arrangements that can be made at the certificate examinations for students with special needs. My intention is to make the examination system more inclusive and responsive to those with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the leaving certificate examination, an additional 20 minutes was allocated for <Col N="782" /> certain subjects where some students might have a difficulty with the extensive essay writing involved. I have also provided, for the first time, for students to seek an exemption from some components of a subject. For example, a deaf student can achieve the maximum grade without having to take an aural examination.</P>
    <P>While improving the arrangements I have also maintained the position that examiners who have difficulty accessing material presented by candidates may refer the candidates script to their supervisor. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work of students must ultimately be assessed according to strictly objective marking criteria which relate exclusively to the assessment issues for the subject concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give consideration to the issues and concerns raised in the submissions (details supplied) from two disadvantaged national schools in Dublin 7 and 8 who are appalled at the prospect of each losing a teacher.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first school mentioned by the Deputy, the current staffing is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 108 pupils as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher, a remedial teacher, a shared home school liaison teacher, a teacher for non nationals and an amalgamation concessionary teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 90 pupils, which is sufficient to retain the current staffing into the next school year. The managerial authority of the school has sought the appointment of an additional teacher for non-nationals. The case is currently being examined by my Department and the board will be advised of the position in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> In relation to the second school, the current staffing is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 92 as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of two remedial teachers, a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a temporary special <Col N="784" /> additional assistant, in view of the special needs of the school. The enrolment as at 30 September 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 81 pupils. Unfortunately, this means that the school's mainstream staffing must be reduced to two teachers.</P>
