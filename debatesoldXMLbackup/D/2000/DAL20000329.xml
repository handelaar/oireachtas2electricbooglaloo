      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Stagg, Sargent, Yates and Joe Higgins. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public interest: the serious escalation of official and unofficial industrial disputes within the CIE Group which has now left virtually the entire country without a public transport system and, in view of the serious inconvenience caused for commuters and the damage and disruption to business and commerce, the need for the Government to take action to secure the reopening of talks between the trade unions and management with a view to securing a negotiated settlement to the disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I request that Dáil Éireann be suspended under Standing Order 31 to allow the Government an opportunity in this House, rather than by way of press release, to radically overhaul its inadequate approach to mobility in public transport given the chaos which now grips the country in the transport sector and the resulting distress for everyone affected, including the company which is being blackmailed by the Government in refusing further investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the urgent matter of the suspension of virtually all public transport services today, including Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, DART and other rail services, involving unofficial and secondary picketing resulting in 400,000 commuters being unable to avail of services; the need for the Government to provide adequate contingency arrangements so that essential travel will be facilitated, and the failure to date of the Government to intervene either by way of industrial resolution or the provision of alternative transport arrangements.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance: the failure of the Government to address endemic low pay in Dublin Bus; the reliance on a low pay regime to subsidise public transport in Dublin as well as nationally, and the failure of the Government to provide adequate subsidies to resolve these problems and the consequent nationwide strike in public transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business shall be as follows: No. 37<i>a</i>, statement on European summit in Lisbon, and No. 5, Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 37<i>a</i>, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 70 minutes and the statements shall be confined to the following Members who shall be called upon in the following sequence and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements by the Taoiseach and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, and (ii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. Private Members' Business shall be No. 90, motion re broadcasting to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree to the timetable for today we should have an indication from the Government as to when it proposes to provide time for the Standing Order 31 motion on the collapse of transport services and the breach of the partnership agreement by members of trade unions which have only recently voted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This breach of the industrial peace clauses of the agreement is a grave matter affecting partnership. I understand that 800 of the workers involved in paralysing the rail service are members of a trade union which only last week endorsed an agreement which clearly contains, in Annex II, Clause 11, a no strike clause. This is a <Col N="4" /> serious matter. The Taoiseach should meet the relevant trade unions today to examine the standing of Annex II of the partnership agreement, of which Clauses 11 and 12, in particular, refer to industrial peace, in view of the breach of the agreement by one of the trade unions concerned. I hope the Taoiseach will address that matter, but also that there will be agreement to have this debate early rather than late in the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31, the time appointed is 7 p.m. but the House is free to agree otherwise. I would remind the House that Standing Order 31 is a motion to adjourn the House. If it is taken earlier, the House adjourns after the debate.</P>

      <P>Do I take it to be a ruling, Sir, that the issue which was raised by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, and other Deputies, that is, the national transport strike, will be debated at 7 o'clock and that the Government, by its silence, has acquiesced to that&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us not find ourselves in a procedural wrangle. People are not able to get to life-saving appointments with their medical consultants because the transport system is not conveying them to and from hospital at present. It is that serious. People will die if this continues. I hope that the Taoiseach will authorise his Whip to allow for an early debate, irrespective of what is set out in Standing Orders, on this subject before noon today by whatever possible means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If not by an adjournment motion, it should be done by some other motion. I ask that this be done in view of the fact that this is now the gravest possible threat to the working of the country but also to the lives of many sick people, who cannot get to their hospital appointments today and who need assurance that those hospital appointments will be preserved for them.</P>

As he has no doubt reflected on the contingency of this motion being allowed, will he indicate when he we will take this debate? On the basis of a reasonable suggestion being made by the Taoiseach, we could agree to the Order of Business but we should hear the Taoiseach first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I made a clear request on the basis that the traditional format of statements is unsatisfactory. The Taoiseach said that questions are taken at Question Time also and I agreed, but they have been ruled out of order because this matter is now being debated. It is not a question that the rules are set and cannot be changed &ndash; the Government can set the rules for Standing Orders in respect of how this matter will be dealt with. We made a fairly modest request that there would be questions and answers instead of a series of prepared statements, which we could effectively fax to each other and not take up the time of the House.</P>

We do not necessarily need to have a vote on this, if we get a reasonable answer from the Taoiseach as to the timing of the debate on the collapse of the transport service. I think we will get that answer, but I do not know. Will this debate take place early in the day or at 7 p.m., which is too late?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Bruton has asked me about Standing Order 31. The position on Standing Order 31 is that if it is allowed by the Chair, it is taken at 7 p.m. and then the House adjourns. Obviously that would not be satisfactory. To get over that and have an earlier debate, the Whip could introduce a motion so that we could have the debate earlier, a point with which the Government agrees, and then the House would resume its normal business of the day. That requires us setting out the times involved. If the House agrees, we will do that as soon as the times can be worked out by the Whip. I ask that this be agreed now because otherwise his order does not stand.</P>
      <P>As you allowed Deputy Bruton to comment, a Cheann Comhairle, may I comment also? Public transport is at a virtual standstill. Dublin Bus drivers are on official strike in support of their 20% claim. Of course, what has exasperated the situation today is that other workers have taken unofficial secondary action in support of the Dublin Bus workers' claim. Iarnród Éireann permanent way staff have taken unofficial strike action despite the fact that no ballot has been held on a Labour Court recommendation for a 20% phased pay increase as part of a restructuring claim. They already have a restructuring claim which has been put forward by the Labour Court on which they have not bothered to vote but they have taken secondary action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Special European Council on Employment in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, also attended. I take this opportunity to commend Prime Minister Guterres and the Portuguese Presidency for calling the summit and for the enormous efforts made to ensure a successful outcome.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to have the opportunity which the summit afforded to outline to our European partners the success of the Irish experience over the last number of years. Our experience demonstrates that it is possible to underpin social progress through economic and employment development and to combine prudent fiscal policies with increased social spending. It does not mean abandoning social goals or the crucial balance between economic development and social equity which characterises the European model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the enormous efforts of the Presidency through bilateral contacts with partners, the Commission and the Council secretariat and a variety of special preparatory meetings, but I should also mention the exceptional level of interest taken by individual member states who <Col N="10" /> produced individual and joint responses to the Presidency's paper. In Ireland's case we did both, reflecting our deep interest in the summit.</P>
    <P>On 6 March I submitted to Prime Minister Guterres Ireland's national response to the Presidency paper on the content of the European Council. The paper focused on our priorities for the summit, particularly in the areas of life long learning, the economic and social environment, IT access and e-commerce, research and development and the role of benchmarking. I also submitted with Prime Minister Blair a joint paper highlighting areas of common concern for our two countries on which we wished to see progress during the summit. That paper focused on education and life long learning, innovation and enterprise and measures to combat social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The summit has set the Union a new strategic goal for the next decade as follows: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Achieving this goal requires an overall strategy aimed at preparing the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society by better policies for the information society and research and development, as well as by stepping up the process of structural reform for competitiveness and innovation and by completing the internal market; modernising the European social model, investing in people and combating social exclusion; and sustaining the healthy economic outlook and favourable growth prospects by applying an appropriate macro-economic policy mix. I was happy to give my full support to the above strategy and will now outline some of the major outcomes from the summit from Ireland's perspective.</P>
    <P>For a number of years we have given an increased emphasis to the potential contribution which the information society, if properly harnessed, can make to the lives of everybody in society. The conclusions of the Lisbon Summit demonstrate Union level recognition of this contribution. In terms of the development of e-commerce, Europe clearly is currently a long way behind the US. Before we can begin to close this gap it is vital that Europe adopts a harmonised regulatory framework for e-commerce as early as possible. For this reason I gave my full support to the objective of all e-commerce related directives currently under discussion being adopted by the end of 2000. For our part, Ireland will use every effort to meet this objective.</P>
    <P>The lnternet is at the heart of the information society revolution and Europe needs to embrace it fully if it is to achieve the benefits of growth, employment and inclusion that the information society offers. I therefore welcome the high priority that the Commission and the European Council are giving to rapid expansion of low cost, high speed lnternet access. The availability of broad band and other advanced communications infrastructure and services at low costs is one of <Col N="11" /> the prerequisites of an economy based on innovation and knowledge.</P>
    <P>The shift to a digital, knowledge-based economy, prompted by new goods and services, will be a powerful engine for growth, competitiveness and jobs. In addition, it will be capable of improving citizens' quality of life and the environment. To make the most of this opportunity, the European Council requested a comprehensive e-Europe action plan to be presented to the European Council in June, using an open method of co-ordination based on the benchmarking of national initiatives and drawing on the Commission's recent e-Europe initiative as well as its communication, &ldquo;Strategies for jobs in the Information Society&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the Union to close the gap between itself and the US in the e-commerce area, EU leaders stressed the need for competitive services. Accordingly, it was decided that a fully integrated and liberalised telecommunications market should be completed by the end of 2001. In particular, it is intended that this will involve greater competition in local access networks before the end of 2000 and unbundling the local loop in order to help bring about a substantial reduction in the costs of using the lnternet.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Europe's education and training systems need to adapt both to the demands of the knowledge society and to the need for an improved level and quality of employment. They will have to offer learning and training opportunities tailored to target groups at different stages of their lives. This new approach should have three main components: the development of local learning centres, the promotion of new basic skills, in particular in the information technologies, and increased transparency of qualifications. In order to achieve these aims, the summit set a number of targets which I am pleased to say we in Ireland have already reached or are due to meet within the timescale outlined. I also fully supported the commitment to a substantial increase in <i>per capita</i> investment in human resources.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we have accepted that the wider use of information and communication technology &ndash; ICTs &ndash; will facilitate a higher quality of learning and teaching. Our schools IT 2000 programme is already ahead of target with every school now having an lnternet connection. In addition, a new £81 million programme for technology use in schools has recently been announced which sets new ambitious targets in the education area.</P>
    <P>The special role of the Education Council in this area was recognised by the summit. As a result, it will undertake a general reflection on the concrete future objectives of education systems, focusing on common concerns and priorities while respecting national diversity, with a view to presenting a broader report to the European Council in Spring 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government has recognised the central role of research, technology and innovation in a <Col N="12" /> knowledge-based economy with an unprecedented level of funding committed in the national development plan. At Lisbon it was agreed that research activities at national and Union level must be better integrated and co-ordinated to make them as efficient and innovative as possible and to ensure that Europe offers attractive prospects to its best brains. A number of steps were agreed towards the establishment of a European research area, including the development of appropriate mechanisms for networking national and joint research programmes; improvements in the environment for private research investment, research and development partnerships and high technology start-ups by using tax policies, venture capital and EIB support; the creation by the end of 2001 of a very high-speed trans-European network for electronic scientific communications; and that a Community patent is available by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to point to the Government's recent announcement of the £560 million technology foresight fund which will provide the necessary impetus in research and development in the ICT and biotechnology areas.</P>
    <P>In advance of the summit I had sought, as a concrete outcome, the creation of a charter for small firms to set out clearly how we can help this key sector to develop through better and more sensitive regulation, easier access to venture capital and technology and the creation of a wider culture of enterprise. Accordingly, I welcome the commitment given to the establishment of a European charter for small business to be endorsed in June, which will commit member states to focus on small companies as the main engines for job creation in Europe and to respond specifically to their needs.</P>
    <P>One of the Union's greatest successes is the Single Market in goods and services. However, in keeping with its focus on competitiveness, the Lisbon summit recognised that in order to ensure the interests of business and consumers, rapid work is still required in certain sectors to complete the internal market and to improve under performance in others. We agreed, in order to meet this aim, to set out by the end of 2000 a strategy for the removal of barriers to services; to speed up liberalisation in areas such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport; to conclude work in good time on the forthcoming proposals to update public procurement rules; to take the necessary steps to ensure that it is possible by the end of 2003 for Union and government procurement to take place on line; and to set out by 2001 a strategy for further co-ordinated action to simplify the regulatory environment, including the performance of public administration at both national and Union level.</P>
    <P>Efficient and transparent financial markets foster growth and employment by better allocation of capital and reducing its cost. Since the introduction of the euro, good progress has been made on the rapid integration of money markets and <Col N="13" /> payments systems. However, we must accept that a great deal of work still needs to be done. The European Council recognised that the Union's financial markets remain segmented and business and consumers have not yet fully benefited from direct access to cross-Border financial institutions. Again, the Union is currently behind the US. It was agreed that the financial services action plan should be implemented by 2005 in an attempt to close this gap. In addition, full implementation of the risk capital action plan by 2003 will be ensured. I fully support the need for priority action to achieve a fully integrated financial services market.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Union, through the existing broad economy policy guidelines and the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes, has the necessary instruments to carry forward the outcomes from the summit. However, it was agreed that the guidelines should focus increasingly on the medium-term and long-term implications of structural policies and on reforms aimed at promoting economic growth potential, employment and social cohesion, as well as on the transition towards a knowledge-based economy.</P>
    <P>Implementation of this strategy will be achieved by improving the existing processes; introducing a new open method of co-ordination at all levels; and by a stronger guiding and co-ordinating role for the European Council to ensure more coherent strategic direction and effective monitoring of progress. The first meeting of the Council each year in spring will determine the relevant high level mandates and ensure that they are followed up. I welcome this development as it will allow the necessary political emphasis to be placed on these crucial issues.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long recognised that the mainstreaming of social inclusion in general Government policy is a vital factor in tackling social inclusion. Undoubtedly, the new knowledge-based society offers tremendous potential for reducing social exclusion, both by creating the economic conditions for greater prosperity through higher levels of growth and employment and opening up new ways of participating in society. It is also important, at the same time, to recognise the risk of an ever-widening gap between those who have access to the new knowledge and those who are excluded. In order to promote social inclusion, the European Council is seeking to promote a better understanding of social exclusion through continued dialogue and exchanges of information and best practice; to mainstream the promotion of inclusion in member states' employment, education and training, health and housing policies; and to develop priority actions addressed to specific target groups.</P>
    <P>I argued in Lisbon that the turnaround in Ireland's economic and social fortunes is in no small part attributable to our system of social partnership. This has allowed us to develop a shared understanding with the social partners of the challenges to be faced and the strategies to <Col N="14" /> be adopted to tackle them. I gave strong support in this respect to the European Commission in seeking to encourage the social partners to begin discussions this year on all aspects of the knowledge-based economy and society. The social partners need to be more closely involved in drawing up, implementing and following employment guidelines at Union level. In Ireland, this already happens.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the European Council acknowledged that the European social model, with its developed systems of social protection, must underpin the transformation to the knowledge economy. However, there is a shared understanding that the model needs to be adapted to ensure its long-term sustainability in the face of the Union's ageing population, to promote social inclusion and gender equality and to provide quality health services.</P>
    <P>It is essential that member states co-operate together in co-ordinating policy development in this field to meet the major challenges they face in regard to ageing, changing employment patterns and family structures and social exclusion. Given the variety of the systems of social protection among the 15 member states, there is a wealth of experience on social protection policy and its implementation in the EU. The high level working party on social protection will prepare a study on the future evolution of social protection from a long-term perspective, giving particular attention to the sustainability of pensions systems.</P>
    <P>Ireland's demographic profile and the current strength of our economy gives us an opportunity to prepare for the costs which inevitably arise as the population grows older. The problems facing some of our European neighbours demonstrate why we should act now while we have the time and resources. We have established a fund to partially offset the future cost of both social welfare and public service pensions. The Government has decided that 1% of GNP will be set aside every year for this purpose. The majority of the receipts from the privatisation of Eircom have also been ring-fenced for this purpose. This will be viewed as a wise and prudent measure in years to come.</P>
    <P>The European Council recognised that, as well as preserving macro-economic stability and stimulating growth and employment, macro-economic policies should foster the transition towards a knowledge-based economy, which implies an enhanced role for structural policies. As regards the sustainability of public finances a report will be presented by spring 2001 assessing the contribution of public finances to growth and employment. The mandate given for the review of the quality and long-term sustainability of public finances is timely and of crucial importance. The issues posed are critical to the future prosperity and inclusiveness of our societies. A long-term perspective is needed to ensure that budgetary policies are framed for sustainability within budgetary balances which support confidence and growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> Implementation of the Union's ten year strategic goal will be facilitated by applying a new open method of co-ordination as the means of spreading best practice and achieving greater convergence towards the main EU goals. This method, which is designed to help member states to progressively develop their own policies, involves establishing, where appropriate, quantitative and qualitative indicators and benchmarks against the best in the world and tailored to the needs of different member states and sectors as a means of comparing best practice and periodic monitoring, evaluation and peer review organised as mutual learning processes.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking our position and progress in the knowledge-based economy and taking whatever corrective action is highlighted is a necessary underpinning to the new strategy and we should make comparisons with the most advanced economies in the US and elsewhere. We already have the base of raw data and research results in many cases. A structure which will allow this base to be used quickly and productively is needed. The model of voluntary co-operation among member states, with central co-ordination by the Commission, seems to be a good one to follow. This has the potential to allow the process to proceed as fast and efficiently as possible. We cannot mistake analysis for action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the core theme of the summit, anyone examining the conclusions can only be impressed by the very specific goals and deadlines set down in every area which was considered. Equally, one cannot fail to note that, in addition to content, EU leaders acted to ensure that the processes by which the Union's goals are to be attained are streamlined and better synchronised. While no substantial discussion took place on the intergovernmental conference, Ireland together with its partners expressed satisfaction with the progress made to date and I look forward to the Presidency's report at Feira in June.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will outline in detail in his contribution developments in regard to Common European Security and Defence Policy; the Western Balkans; Russia; and the EU-Mexico Agreement. Accordingly, I do not propose to replicate his statement. However, with regard to security and defence, I am happy to report that the European Council welcomed the establishment of the interim bodies foreseen at Helsinki and also the achievements in the non-military crisis management track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It was agreed to establish, by the Feira European Council in June, a committee for civilian crisis management, a development I strongly supported. I reiterate that from Ireland's point of view, developments in the security and defence area must remain based on <Col N="16" /> the Treaty of Amsterdam and on the Cologne and Helsinki conclusions, which firmly ground them in the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>The Lisbon summit focused on the Union's competitiveness across a wide range of areas, but more specifically on harnessing the potential of Europe's greatest asset, its people and its innovation and knowledge base. I will conclude by highlighting that the targets set for investment in human resources and a wide range of research and investment projects are fully in line with our goals under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan. I am gratified that the approach adopted to achieve the targets mirrors the inclusive social partnership, public private partnership approach which has successfully operated in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I envisage the Irish and European level approaches as strongly reinforcing. We set a strategic course in Lisbon for the next decade focusing on the development of the knowledge-based economy and modernising the European social model by investing in people and an active welfare state, and, most importantly, we have set down the concrete steps and deadlines for achieving our goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union is failing in five areas. It is failing to combat racism among its own people. It is devaluing caring and all unpaid work and putting the entire emphasis on what is known as labour market work as if the market defines all value, which it does not. This is all the more surprising considering so many of the Heads of Government are socialists. The European Union is failing in so far as inequality is increasing dramatically within the Union and little is being done about it, but it is increasing even more dramatically in Ireland. The European Union, through its own actions, is setting aside the principles of due process, respect for the law and the right of any person accused to be given a hearing before sentence is passed on them. The European Union is failing to endow itself with proper popular political legitimacy. Its decisions are being taken by elites whose mandates will survive as long as there is no crisis but they will not survive a crisis because they lack popular legitimacy. I wish to deal with each of these points in order.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of serious concern, as I said in Lisbon after the European People's Party summit, that racism is growing in Europe. A mayor of the current governing party in Spain was recently re-elected with a greatly enhanced majority on the strength of a proposal he made that immigrants to Spain should not be allowed to live in the centre of his city but should instead be kept in particular suburbs to where they would be confined. That man was re-elected by the Spanish electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France, a recent opinion poll indicated that 70% of the French people find the presence of immigrants in their country aggravating. That represents an increase of 11% in two years in the <Col N="17" /> number of people expressing anti-immigrant sentiments. Arabs call forth the greatest hostility among French people but there is a growth of eight points in the number of those who find people of black skin unacceptable in France. There is also a growth in anti-Semitism among the French people. This is true of all other European countries. There is a growth in racism in this country, in Germany and in all countries.</P>
    <P>When European leaders meet, they should take a stand, and they should have taken a stand against this phenomenon of growing racism, yet racism is not even mentioned in the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit. We cannot talk about a new economy without tolerance. A new economy is based on trust, exchange and globalisation. There can be no durable globalisation without tolerance. There can be no effective economy without trust, and societies that are riven by racial prejudices of the kind we are seeing in this country cannot progress towards a new economy in an untroubled way. The first failure of the European Union has been its failure to take a firm stand against racism.</P>
    <P>I have criticised the Taoiseach's remarks in Australia where he referred to centres where people could not leave until the procedures had been gone through, in other words, they were detained there until the procedures were gone through. That, to my mind, is a detention centre, however one defines it. By raising this matter the Taoiseach was responding, unfortunately, to sentiments expressed at home. He may have done this inadvertently and unintentionally but the truth of the matter is that these sort of sentiments adduce a sympathetic response from an unfortunately growing section of our electorate and should be avoided at all times by people commenting at public events. Such comments should not be made. Misconstruction and misquotation is no excuse, and in this instance there was no misquotation because the quotes are exact.</P>
    <P>I criticise the way Europe is developing in the sense that it is economistic. The development of the European Union is being guided solely by the values of the market. Only those forms of work which are paid for count as far as the European Union is concerned. This is a critique that is not just being made by me; it was also made by the United Nations in a recent study it produced on the quality of life. It pointed to the fact that the society being created by globalisation has three deficiencies. Because global forces attract investment to the area of lowest taxation, they put a fiscal squeeze on welfare services. By the physical laws of globalisation, welfare services are being stripped of money because low taxation is the way to attract investment. The United Nations made the point that globalisation creates incentives for misuse of the environment. There is a short-term attraction in global competition to spend as little as possible on environmental protection because that costs money and adds a cost to the product being produced and to run down environmental assets irresponsibly to win markets <Col N="18" /> abroad.  The UN has pointed out that globalisation is placing a time squeeze on caring, and this is most relevant to the debate on our budget. People do not have time to care for their children any more in this pressured globalised market. As far as the European Union is concerned, people who take off time from work to look after either a sick relative, a sick child or a member of their family who may be perfectly well but who needs care, do not count because paragraph 4 of the European summit conclusions, endorsed by the Taoiseach &ndash; this could have been written by Minister McCreevy &ndash; states, &ldquo;The employment rate is too low and is characterised by insufficient participation in the labour market by women and older workers&rdquo;. In other words, the only thing that any woman, older person or any person should do is participate in the labour market. One's work does not count if it is not being valued by the market. That is the philosophical value of this summit. Only paid work counts as far as this summit is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that statement. It is wrong to say such a thing. All work that is designed to make life better for oneself or for other people, whether it is paid for or not, counts and should be valued. This narrow, economistic approach, which values only labour force participation, which sounds almost like a fascist phraseology, something one could imagine being put down under the words &ldquo;Arbeit Macht Frei&rdquo; as an emblem of success&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach can quote all the reports and focus groups he wants to advise him on the sort of off the cuff remarks he made when in Australia.</P>
      <P>In my view, carers count, whether they are paid or not. I do not accept an approach to the economy, such as that set out in the European Presidency conclusions, which puts no value on unpaid work. I stand by that view, which is why I oppose the philosophy of the Government's budgetary policy and criticise the philosophy of the Presidency's conclusions in Lisbon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> The European Presidency conclusions are comparatively silent on the growth of inequality in Europe. It is important to bear in mind that, left on their own, markets will lead to ever wider inequality, up to a certain point when other equalising factors come into play.</P>
    <P>According to the recent UN report which I quoted from earlier, three countries in the developed world, two of which were in the European Union, were singled out as having the highest levels of inequality, that is, the difference between the top and bottom 20% of income levels. The country with the worst record of inequality was, as a result of globalisation, the United States of America. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had the third worst record. The country with the second worst record &ndash; worse than Britain but not quite as bad as the United States &ndash; in terms of the growth of inequality between the top and bottom income quintiles was Ireland, the Celtic tiger. It is not surprising that income inequality is not being benchmarked, which is the new word, by the summit. The Taoiseach issued a long paper urging benchmarking on all sorts of matters but I do not think he has urged benchmarking on inequality.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise there is a dynamic in the world which lies at the heart of, and is perhaps the source of, the growth of a self-protective racism in the developed world. The income gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% of people in the world in 1870 was 7:1. When Irish people were emigrating to America in 1870 they were probably in the bottom 20% and those in the top 20% were seven times better off than them. By 1960, the gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% in the world was 30:1; in other words, the top 20% were 30 times better off than the bottom 20%. By 1997, the multiple had reached 74 &ndash; the top 20% of the world's people, which includes Irish people, are now 74 times better off than the bottom 20%, as compared to seven times better off in 1870. That puts the problem of immigration in its true context. If there is that degree of difference between the better off and the less well off, there will be pressure for immigration into the areas where those high incomes are being earned.</P>
    <P>I have referred to racism, the devaluation of caring and the growing inequality in the world and in Ireland. The fourth area that has not been dealt with adequately is respect for due process between nations. The imposition of sanctions on Austria, which was reviewed in Lisbon, was neither based on, nor covered by, an EU Treaty provision. The manner in which the decision was taken constitutes a deliberate evasion of a procedure specifically provided for in Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union for dealing with countries that are delinquent in some way. The Portuguese EU Presidency deliberately evaded the legal processes of Article 7 to impose these sanctions on Austria. It is deplorable for a country, which is part of a union which is supposed to <Col N="20" /> be based on law, to participate, as Ireland did, in a deliberate evasion of the responsibilities imposed on it by Article 7 of the Treaty of the EU, whatever the cause.</P>
    <P>The decision to impose these sanctions on Austria without previous dialogue with the Austrian Government violated the general principles of law. I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs is, as a lawyer, familiar with those general principles. People should be given a hearing before they are sanctioned. Austria received no hearing before it was sanctioned by Ireland and the other 13 member states. The principle of the right to a fair hearing is fundamental to European civilisation. The rule of law is the source of our economic success. If a state does not practice the rule of law in its relationships with other European Union member states, it is undermining a fundamental principle. That fundamental principle was breached by the Taoiseach and the other heads of government when they agreed to evade the responsibilities of Article 7 of the Treaty and to impose sanctions without giving a hearing to the state against which they were imposed. It is very important to re-establish that principle.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Taoiseach, in agreeing to the European sanctions against Austria, breached the Irish Constitution. The Constitution requires us all to act in accordance with the principles of democracy and the application of laws in a fair way. In agreeing to these sanctions, the Taoiseach did not abide by the Constitution, which should require a hearing to be given to anyone against whom a sanction is being imposed, such as Austria.</P>
    <P>There is also a general principle of equality in European law. This principle requires that similar situations shall not be treated differently, unless the differentiation is objectively justified. The sanctions against Austria were not taken either on the basis of a hearing being given to the Austrians or on the basis of specific examples being given of where the breach of European law or any other norms took place. It did not represent an equal treatment of similar situations. The Freedom Party of Austria was previously in government with the socialists. It participated in government with Dr. Bruno Kreisky as chancellor.</P>

      <P>Dr. Bruno Kreisky was not sanctioned for participating in government with the Freedom Party, although two members of the then Freedom Party government were former SS officers. Now, however, when a member of the Austrian People's Party participates in government with the Freedom Party, the majority of European Union heads of government take action that they did not take against Bruno Kreisky. I do not think this is because the majority of EU summiteers are socialists because the most <Col N="21" /> militant in their demands for these sanctions were the French and the Spanish.</P>

      <P>I also find objectionable, on the same principle, the decision taken by the summit that the sanctions against Serbia will be maintained until President Milosevic is removed from office. Sanctions should be maintained on the basis of measures rather than men, of objective conditions rather than singling out an individual and saying we will sanction a country if that individual remains in office.</P>
      <P>It could not be said he is a war criminal. If he is a war criminal, he is an accused war criminal; he is not yet a convicted war criminal. It is wrong and contrary to law to impose sanctions on an individual until he has been tried and convicted. He has not been tried or convicted. It is wrong in principle to impose sanctions related to an individual participating in government and it is another example of the sort of <i>ad hoc</i> politically motivated decision making that passes for leadership in the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment on the procedure for this kind of debate, or set of statements which more accurately describes what we are participating in. While it is correct for the Taoiseach to say that this is the format that has characteristically been the way in which we have dealt with these matters, I ask him in the light of his own comments at the Institute of European Affairs last week, whether this form of reportage back to the national Parliaments is extending the legitimacy of the European Project in any meaningful way? That is not to say that the Taoiseach is not adhering to the normal practice, which he certainly is. Before I go through the comments on the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit &ndash; Deputy Bruton made some interesting comments on a whole range of other matters, to which a time limit of 20 minutes will curtail my response &ndash; would the Taoiseach consider, perhaps in consultation with the Whips, a different way in which we can convey this kind of reportage back from what are now four summits a year? In the light of added responsibility which the spring summit will have arising from the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, should the Taoiseach go before the Committee on European Affairs or should there be some series of statements followed by a set of questions and answers &ndash; a Committee Stage debate? From the Taoiseach's point of view and that of the Government of the day, which has changed with every election since 1969, this practice would enable us to gain more understanding of what is happening within the European Union and address the very democratic deficit to which the Taoiseach referred in the European Institute last <Col N="22" /> week. The absence of the media in the Gallery is a fair indication of the priority being given to the dialogue in which we are now engaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They can argue that they can access our contributions or they can listen to them, which is true, but the presence or absence in the Gallery of the media is an indication of the level of priority they attach and subsequently that their editors will attach to the reportage of what happened in Lisbon or any other summit.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that what became known in jargon as the dot.com Summit took place at a time of controversy around investments in dot.com companies and that they, in some cases, as Will Hutton commented in <i>The Guardian</i>, bring echoes of the great bubble in investment in tulips in the last century. We need to be a little cautious, as investors have recently found, about the allure and the apparently effortless wealth that can be created by new technologies. I support the thrust of the Lisbon Summit, a project that Antonio Guterres has been trying to promote within the socialist group of party leaders for some time. It received enthusiastic support from a number of heads of government including our Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, I welcome the conclusions of the Summit, which is not to say that the Summit addressed every issue on the European agenda. It certainly did not but it did not set out to address every issue on the European agenda because no summit could meaningfully do so and be practical or functional. In many respects Ireland is ahead of the posse on a variety of issues outlined in the conclusions of the Summit. The Taoiseach was in a position to reinforce the conclusions of our information society which was established by the previous Administration with the commitment to link every school to the Internet within a relatively short period and to provide lifelong learning facilities for members of Irish society, be they in the labour force or not. Those kinds of conclusions at a European level are positive and reinforce what we have been trying to do over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have a concern which has not been addressed in the Taoiseach's comments on the evolving constitutional nature of the new role taken on by the Summit arising from Lisbon. There is an ambiguity in whether the Commission will have a co-ordinating role every year to review progress and to benchmark and to measure what has been achieved. It seems, referring to the Taoiseach's comments in the Institute of European Affairs last week, that Ireland must insist at all times on having a Commissioner, a position that I formally and fully endorse and have personally and directly conveyed to Romano Prodi on 10 March. There is an ambiguity in the set of conclusions from the Lisbon Summit <Col N="23" /> where it refers to a pre-eminent and co-ordinating role for the European Council to ensure overall coherence and effective monitoring of progress towards the new strategic goal. It is not clear from my reading of the text and the Taoiseach's own text whether the Commission will have a primary task in co-ordinating or the Council will have a primary task in co-ordinating, measuring and benchmarking this. This is very important. The more the Council takes on for itself &ndash; the Council is not inside the Treaty in a formal sense, it is not accountable to the Parliament and it is not justiciable in terms of Luxembourg &ndash; the more that is a further move towards intergovernmentalism which is decidedly not in the interest of small member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am reading from the conclusions &ndash; and I invite the Taoiseach to clarify it because I may be reading it wrong &ndash; that there is a danger in the ambiguity of the text and the conflict between it and the Taoiseach's text where he clearly refers to the Commission having a co-ordinating role and the Council having a co-ordinating role. The reference in the Taoiseach's circulated script refers to the model of voluntary co-operation among member states with central co-ordination by the Commission &ndash; this is just before the reference to the intergovernmental conference to which I will come later. This point needs to be clarified because what has happened in the ECOFIN Council, as the Minister for Finance will tell him, is that, with the advent of Euro 11, most of the work is now being done at Euro 11 on an informal basis and the formalities with Euro 15 are to tell the other four what has been decided at a macro-economics level and elsewhere. When Greece, Sweden and Denmark take part &ndash; recently Svend Auken, Danish Environment Minister, indicated to me that that would probably be carried in the referendum later this year albeit by a very small majority &ndash; the ECOFIN Council with Britain and the other 14 inside will become a totally different hybrid from what it was before.</P>
    <P>That is Britain's problem on one level but it means that the movement away from co-ordinating macro-economic policy, all the matters supporting it and realising in full the completion of the Internal Market, are issues in which the Commission should have a central role. I detect a danger here, which I can hear in some of the utterances of Tony Blair and other leaders of the large parties, such as Jospin and Schröder. They are much more comfortable with the intergovernmentalism of the Union than with the role of the Commission. In the context of enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference this is a serious matter for us, again referring back to the democratic legitimacy to which the Taoiseach referred in the Institute of European Affairs last week.</P>
    <P>I move from this to the Taoiseach's reference to the Intergovernmental Conference itself. Since <Col N="24" /> I do not know what the Minister for Foreign Affairs will say about the other aspects, I will wait, listen and respond accordingly. It is essential, given what has been agreed in Lisbon, that the Council will have a much more proactive role in co-ordinating economic activity, with or without the input from the Commission which has to be decided, but it seems that there is now a clearly, newly defined job for a Commissioner in a Commission of 20 to do precisely this. These approaches are necessary and the conclusions of the European Summit are valid as far as they go, which is not to ignore the points made by Deputy Bruton. For years, Europe was castigated for being too slow in its development relative to other parts of the world and relative to the globalisation of the world's economy. The completion of the Internal Market will give us the economic wherewithal to do many of the things we need and want to do.</P>
    <P>It will be painful, however, and there will be a lot of restructuring involved. That is why the protection and maintenance of the European social model and its modernisation are critically important if we are to get the sort of internal restructuring which the logic of the internal market suggests. We have already begun to see it with the large motor manufacturers on the one hand and the financial institutions on the other.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I mean, there are currently 41 stock exchanges in the European Union but that number will be rationalised down to about five or six at the very most within ten years, if not sooner. There are enormous implications for workers, their families and communities as to how that rationalisation will be achieved. It cannot be done in an Anglo-Saxon manner, it has to be done within the framework of existing and enhanced EU legislation. The left in Europe only bought into the internal market on the basis that the social charter would be there as a counter-balance and protection. I was glad to see the references to the model of social protection in the Taoiseach's speech. While there is probably an over-emphasis on pensions, there is a need for greater participation by those who wish to participate in the EU labour force. Other issues, such as paternity leave and child care provision, all the issues in regard to which Ireland is bottom of the league, will have to be addressed clearly.</P>
    <P>As regards the intergovernmental conference, in a speech to the Institute of European Affairs in Dublin last week the Taoiseach said that depending on the precise form of the conclusions at Nice later this year, there may or may not be a requirement for a referendum. I strongly urge the Taoiseach to make it clear that there will be a referendum, even if strictly speaking it is not legally necessary. On a previous occasion the Taoiseach promised a referendum on Ireland's participation in the Partnership for Peace, which was never legally necessary. If, however, he wants to address the issue of democratic legitimacy which is a major and increasing problem within the European Union, it is inconceivable that this <Col N="25" /> country would not have a referendum even if it is just to give effect to matters left over from the Amsterdam Treaty. The referendum on Europe will be the first one that is not economic in nature, but political as far as the Irish electorate is concerned. When they voted for the Maastricht Treaty, in essence, they were voting for the so-called £8 billion that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, brought back from Edinburgh. That is the way it was promoted. Many other aspects of the Amsterdam Treaty were not highlighted during that debate. There will be no such economic package or dimension to a forthcoming referendum on Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the Government to develop the paper the Taoiseach presented to the Institute of European Affairs either as a White Paper, a statement of intent or a policy position. It will probably be clearer after the conclusion of the Portuguese Presidency and the start of the French Presidency when I urge the Taoiseach to set out the Government's position. That should be done on the assumption that either way we are definitely going to have a conclusion and a treaty at Nice, because that seems to be the thrust of every participating party to the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is not sufficient for the Government to say it wants to hold onto a European Commissioner. We have to argue very clearly for the centrality of the Commission's role in the future enlargement of the European Union. We must be generous as regards changes in weighted voting for the larger member states and, perhaps, the extension of qualified majority voting in other areas in order to maintain a balance. Otherwise, some larger member states will lose a Commissioner as a result and that will cause difficulties for them. Many applicant countries are waiting for us to articulate this point because they see Ireland as the role model for their membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has visited quite a number of the applicant countries, including Slovenia, Hungary and Poland. They have told him, as they have told me and others, that they see Ireland as a role model, much more so than Finland, Austria or Sweden which were wealthy and well developed prior to EU membership. Ireland has the unique experience of having made a rapid journey, moving from peripheral poverty, if I may use that phrase, to substantial economic wealth and having a central role to play. The Government of the day has to give leadership in preparing such a paper to set out clearly Ireland's position on these matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the points made by Deputy Bruton in respect of what was not in these conclusions and what we could do as a single entity. The European Union is not a state, it is a hybrid of a constitutional kind for which there is currently no description or adjective. It will become one going into this century and will be copied by other regions. I have used the phrase &ldquo;post-federal construction&rdquo; to describe the EU, <Col N="26" /> but it is an inadequate and misleading term because it does not have a federal aspiration, although I know some people have such aspirations for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Okay, but it is not federal in the sense that Canada, Germany or the United States are. I do not see it in that way. Once the Union gets its act together economically &ndash; Lisbon is focused exclusively on trying to do that &ndash; there are a number of issues that we should work on collectively. The first is to try to reduce the gap between rich and poor worldwide through our unique role in the World Trade Organisation. Seattle was a fiasco because of a conflict between the competing member states of the WTO. There should be a debate on what Europe can do to reduce the poverty gap that ultimately threatens our security along with the absolute devastation it is causing for people's lives in other parts of the world. That is easy to say but difficult to encounter. It means, for example, given Deputy Bruton's constituency, opening up our agricultural markets to third country producers and suppliers. The IFA would be the first to demand that we should protect Irish and European farmers in that respect. There are a lot of hard choices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many easy things can be said because they are comfortable to say, but difficult choices must be made. We have to provide leadership, which is expected. The issue of the Austrian Government, to which Deputy Bruton referred, is precisely about racism and about the comfort that Haider's so-called Freedom Party gave to anti-immigration sentiments throughout Austria. Other factors brought about the change in Government there, including a cosy cartel and a Government that had been in office for the best part of 30 years with an absolutely repugnant system whereby every public office post in the country&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;was split up between the two parties in Government. I know the situation in Austria is complex but the issue of racism is at the centre of the ostracism of the Austrian Government. That ostracism by the leaders of the European Union, which I support, is not of the Republic of Austria nor of its people, but of a particular Government which deliberately set out <Col N="27" /> through one of its constituent parts to mobilise the racist fears of a sector of the electorate. Those fears can also be found in every other part of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Unless we deal positively with the issue of immigration we will not be able to address other issues that will confront the European Union over the next 20 or 30 years. The issues that will affect the lives of those school children in the Visitors Gallery when they are adults include the deficiency in the social welfare fund for pensions, although good progress has been made in this country in that respect, and the decline in the working population both inside and outside the home. It is something the Government decided to do yesterday by seeking an extra 28,500 workers who will come here over the next five or six years. In embracing that necessity by opening up the doors of the European Union to people who wish to live here, we must realise that new immigrants bringing strange cultures threaten and frighten some people in every country of the European Union. It is the responsibility of both the Government and the European Union to lead in that area.</P>
      <P>I can see a new task in relation to racism, assimilation and integration becoming the responsibility of the Commission and not just that of the Council. These will flow naturally from the Lisbon summit. If everything set out in the conclusions of that summit are achieved, then the European Union will attract more and more economic migrants and asylum seekers who will want to become part of what will be the largest single legal market entity in the world, with approximately 500 million people.</P>
      <P>If we do not realise that is going to happen and if we do not prepare for it, we will have the sort of problems that characterised Europe in the last century. The history of Europe in the last century is one we can never repeat and we must learn the lessons that history teaches us. The success of the Lisbon conclusions will intensify the probability that more people will want to live not just in Ireland but across Europe and we will have to deal with them in a constructive, positive and inclusive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The theme of the Lisbon Special European Council was &ldquo;Employment, economic reform and social cohesion &ndash; for a Europe of innovation and knowledge.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach's statement showed that the European Council responded creatively to the new opportunities and challenges posed by the transition to an innovation and knowledge-based society. It responded by adopting a new strategic goal for the next decade, namely &ldquo;to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.&rdquo;  It also made clear that the European Council itself is to play a strong guiding and co-ordinating role to <Col N="28" /> ensure the overall coherence and effective monitoring of the work of the Council of Ministers in relation to the specific goals which were agreed at Lisbon and which the Taoiseach has set out comprehensively for the House.</P>
      <P>Looking at the results from Lisbon, we have every justification for taking satisfaction in the outcome. The national position paper which Ireland submitted highlighted five key areas which we felt should feature among the priority areas for attention &ndash; lifelong learning, education and training, the economic and social environment, IT access, research and development and benchmarking. It will be clear to Members that these key areas feature extensively in the Presidency's conclusions.</P>
      <P>Recent Irish experience validated a number of the key themes proposed for Lisbon. This applied to the pivotal role which social partnership has come to play over the years since the first national social partnership agreement was reached in 1987. It applied particularly to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in which the Government and the social partners identified lifelong learning and successful adaptation to the information society as priority challenges for the years ahead in Ireland. The suggestions which the Irish Government put forward were firmly rooted in our own recent experience.</P>

      <P>I must put various points that are important for my own sphere of interest on the record. If I get the opportunity without being interrupted I will deal with some of the issues mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It was gratifying and encouraging to find that these approaches commended themselves sufficiently to other member states to be strongly reflected in the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government as reflected in the Presidency's conclusions from Lisbon.</P>
      <P>While the European Council was devoted in the main to economic and social issues, it took account of a preliminary progress report by the Presidency on follow up to the Helsinki European Council conclusions on defence and security. The House will be aware that the question of European security and defence policy is the subject of continuing discussion within the EU on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The focus of these EU discussions is the Petersberg Tasks and not mutual defence commitments of the Article V type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council called for the creation of new interim bodies to enhance the EU's ability to take informed and effective <Col N="29" /> decisions in the area of Petersberg Tasks, and to assist in taking forward the EU discussions on these points. These bodies, and in particular the interim political and security committee foreseen at Helsinki, began to meet this month. The European Council welcomed that fact that these bodies have been established and are starting to function effectively.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a headline goal, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, is to be able to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo. What was agreed upon was a capabilities target and, as the Helsinki European Council conclusions make clear, this does not imply the creation of a European army, nor does it alter the fact that participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis, and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers, was mandated at Helsinki to take forward the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which this target could be met and progress reviewed. Member states will also use existing defence planning procedures which, in the case of Ireland and the other neutral and non-allied EU member states, would include the planning and review process of the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon European Council welcomed the fact that the General Affairs Council has identified a method for elaborating the headline goal and identifying possible contributions which member states could make in due course, without prejudice to the fact that participation in Petersberg Tasks is voluntary, for case by case decision and remains a sovereign matter for decision by the member state concerned. I am particularly glad to note the work that is also being done on non-military crisis management. Natural disasters, such as in Mozambique, and the fact that modern crisis management requires not only military peacekeepers, but also civilian and humanitarian relief assets, testify to the importance of progress on civil crisis management. The European Council has given further impetus to this work and has invited the General Affairs Council to establish by or at the June European Council an EU committee for civilian crisis management.</P>
    <P>Developments in the western Balkans were discussed by Heads of State or Government and Foreign Ministers at dinner on Thursday evening. The discussion took place on the basis of a report submitted by the Secretary-General/High Representative, Mr. Solana, together with the EU Commission. The European Council confirmed that its overall objective remains the fullest possible integration of the countries of the region into <Col N="30" /> the political and economic mainstream of Europe. The stabilisation and association process is the centrepiece of the EU's policy in the Balkans and the countries of the region are being encouraged to work together and with the EU to make a success of this process. The Commission is being urged to make proposals to ensure a fast-track procedure and speedy and effective assistance.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, especially Serbia, remains a major source of concern. The European Council agreed that the EU should maintain its action for democratic change in Serbia, and that selective sanctions aimed at the regime would remain in place as long as President Milosevic stayed in power. Those sanctions are directed against the regime. It is envisaged that NGOs will be used in the region to build up a civil society.</P>
    <P>We must continue with whatever efforts we can in the context of a regime that is oppressing its own people. The sanctions are being directed against the regime, although, obviously, great hardships are being imposed on Serbia as a result of the policies of the Serbian regime regarding its neighbours and the Western world. We must assist in changing this and in supporting democratic opposition to Serbia, which has had its own internal differences. It would be wrong to suggest there is a sanctions policy <i>simpliciter </i>against an individual called Milosevic; it is against Serbia and its regime. There are also other policies at that level to support the opposition and to bring about a position where Milosevic is no longer in power.</P>

      <P>Concern was expressed by member states about the stability of the area. It was agreed that Montenegro's efforts to achieve democratic reform and economic prosperity should be supported by substantial assistance, both to ensure the survival of democratic Government and to avoid another serious crisis in the region.</P>
      <P>Kosovo remains the focus of particular concern. The EU's special responsibility in the region means that it must play the central role in providing international support for Kosovo. The EU has already assumed the major role in contributing to reconstruction in Kosovo and has recognised the need to provide support in a much more co-ordinated, coherent fashion, and to ensure that the efforts of the EU receive appropriate recognition. The key issue currently is the achievement of Serb participation in the interim administration and the municipal elections to be held next autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These will be important steps towards the stabilisation of the situation in Kosovo. However, the European Council noted that lasting stability in the region could only be ensured taking into account the legitimate interests of the neighbouring coun<Col N="31" /> tries of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with full responsibility for territorial integrity and existing borders. There was considerable discussion of how a more coherent and action-oriented strategy could be developed to provide economic and political support to Kosovo and the region. The Stability Pact will make a vital contribution in this regard; in addition, to strengthen the central role of the EU, the Secretary-General/High Representative has been asked by the European Council to undertake, in association with the Commission, an enhanced co-ordination role. This issue will be discussed further at the next meeting of the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>At dinner there was also a discussion of developments in Russia. It was recognised that, on the eve of the presidential election, the EU should signal to Russia the importance of the development of a genuinely effective and working strategic partnership. In this context, it was agreed also that, in regard to Chechnya, Russia should abide by its commitments.</P>
    <P>East Timor remains the focus of attention and concern. The Taoiseach earlier reported to this House on his visit there in March and provided his European colleagues with an assessment of the situation. The President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, also availed of the occasion to spell out the various financial commitments of the Union as well as the other instruments intended to contribute to stability in the region.</P>
    <P>On the margins of the European Council, the EU-Mexico Joint Council met and approved the results of negotiations on a free trade area between the EU and Mexico which is scheduled to come into effect on 1 July.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This morning I have the privilege to present to the House, and to open the debate on a flagship Bill, the Children Bill, 1999. Not alone is it a flagship Bill, it is one of the most important and far-reaching Bills to have been brought before this House in many years. I make this point because the Bill is a blueprint for a new system of juvenile justice which will charter the course of that system for many years to come. The Bill will also affect the lives of many thousands of children and their parents and guardians in the coming decades of this new century. My wish is that it will affect their lives for the better.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill has been a long time in gestation but, as evidenced by the broad approval it received on its publication last autumn, the wait was worthwhile and well justified. We have used the time wisely to bring a balanced, comprehensive, innovative and imaginative Bill to fruition. I do not wish to unduly take up the time of the House to rehearse the many twists and turns over recent years that have eventually culminated in the Bill. However, it is fair to say that the Bill we are now debating is radically different to that which has gone before. Its underlying philosophy is radically different just as much as its provisions are the distillation of the accumulated wisdom and the best practice worldwide in the area of juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>I readily acknowledge that the previous Bill had some good features which I have incorporated into this Bill. I pay tribute to those both inside this House and outside of it who, with the best of motives, produced that Bill. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Austin Currie. Not for one moment do I doubt their commitment to overhaul our system of juvenile justice but I passionately believed that our generation of public representatives had realistically only one shot at the type of radical overhaul of the system which I had in mind. That is why I engaged in a deep analysis prior to producing this radically different and innovative Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My clear focus was to produce an enlightened, <Col N="33" /> enduring and forward thinking Bill. In that respect, I considered it an imperative during my watch, that the available opportunity be used to get it right. This Bill realises that goal. I ordered a thorough reappraisal of the 1996 Bill with the emphasis on introducing into our law, where appropriate, the most up-to-date and sophisticated measures for dealing with juvenile justice and associated child welfare, that took into account best international practice. I also wanted the Bill to deal more progressively with parental responsibility and to identify and correct the structural weaknesses in the way services are provided to young offenders and disturbed non-offending children. I was also unhappy with the way the age of criminal responsibility had been dealt with in the 1996 Bill.</P>
    <P>At first, I thought we might be able to amend the 1996 Bill but the examination of the Bill and a contemporaneous study of recent advances in dealing with juvenile crime identified the need for so many changes that the Government agreed to my request to prepare a totally new Bill. Had we stayed with the existing Bill we would have ended up with somewhere in the region of 400 amendments and that does not include the many other drafting and presentational changes that, while not essential, were highly desirable. I am sure Deputies will agree with me when I say that in the circumstances the 1996 Bill could not realistically be saved.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1999 covers four main areas of the law. First, and predominantly, it provides a modern statutory framework for the further development of the juvenile justice system. Second, it provides for family welfare conferences and other new provisions for dealing with out-of-control non-offending children. Third, it re-enacts and updates provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. It also provides for a special residential services board to advise the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children on policy matters relating to the remand and detention of children and to ensure the efficient, effective and coordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders have been made.</P>
    <P>The starting point for this Bill was the Children Act, 1908. That Act was the basis for the creation and development of a juvenile justice system that, in spite of its many weaknesses, served this country quite well throughout the greater part of the 20th century. However, it is clear that further development of the system would have been impossible without a new statutory framework to underpin it. That essentially is the purpose of the juvenile justice provisions of the Bill. When the Bill becomes law, our juvenile justice system will have the capacity to continue developing within the statutory framework of the most up-to-date thinking internationally on how to prevent juvenile offending or to prevent further offending by <Col N="34" /> juveniles who have already committed their first offence.</P>
    <P>I was well aware when preparing the legislation of mistakes made over many years by other countries when revising their juvenile justice systems. The main error, which was continually repeated, was probably the attempt to devise systems based exclusively on a particular approach to the problem of juvenile offending. In practical terms, this meant the system was more important than the needs and misdeeds of the offender who could only be dealt with within the narrow confines of the system in favour at a particular time. Deputies will notice that I am proposing in the Bill to supplement rather than supplant the provisions on which the present system is based, apart from the obviously archaic or unacceptable. It is essential in legislation such as this not to close off avenues for dealing with young offenders. At the same time, policy should not be dictated by hard cases. That approach has underpinned the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage debate will afford an opportunity to examine the provisions of the Bill in a detailed manner. In my speech today, I will outline the major policy areas of the Bill rather than go through it in a sequential manner.</P>
    <P>An unusual feature of the Bill is that many of its constituent parts are supported by a set of principles or objectives. The importance of this feature should not be underestimated. It will become more apparent when the Bill is enacted and implemented. Thus, Part 4, which places the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis, is supported by a new principle that obliges the gardaí to consider for admission to the programme children who have accepted responsibility for their criminal behaviour. Part 6, which deals with the treatment of child suspects, obliges the gardaí to have due regard to the dignity of children as human persons and to their vulnerability owing to their age and level of maturity. Part 8 establishes the rights of children before the court charged with criminal offences. These include an important new right, not in the 1996 Bill, that is, the principle that criminal proceedings will not be used solely to provide assistance or services needed to care for or protect a child.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Bill, which sets out the powers of the courts in relation to child offenders, includes a comprehensive list of principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children. These have been strengthened since they first appeared in the 1996 Bill. Part 10 establishes the principal object of child detention schools. These are the schools that will provide for the detention of children aged between 12 and 16 years who have been found guilty of offences and in respect of whom the courts deem no option other than detention as appropriate. It emphasises the role of the schools in promoting the reintegration of the children referred to them back into society. This will be done mainly through the provision of <Col N="35" /> appropriate educational and training programmes and facilities.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill that has probably attracted most comment is the one that proposes to raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven years to 12 years. This represents a radical departure from previous policy on how young children whose actions would, but for their ages, constitute offences should be dealt with. It means that children under the age of 12 years will no longer have the capacity to commit offences. The question of raising the age to 12 years was one that exercised my mind for some time but I made the decision based on my belief, first, that as a society we should not criminalise children under 12 years of age, second, that the alternative policy for intervening with such children, that is, by the health boards, often in concert with other agencies, was credible and, third, that health board personnel would deal with these children in their usual professional manner. I was also concerned that of the relatively small number of children under 12 years of age who appear in court on criminal charges some may have been criminalised for the wrong reason, however well meant. There may be a temptation to bring charges for the sole purpose of ensuring that the child received care and protection in an institutional setting. That cannot happen under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is relevant that 12 years was the age recommended by the former Dáil select committee on crime in its first report and that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child criticised our age in the context of the proposal to raise it to ten years in the 1996 Bill. I was unhappy, and said so in my Second Stage contribution to the 1996 Bill, when I was in Opposition, with the proposal in that Bill to raise the age to ten years and to provide for its eventual raising to 12 years by regulations following reviews at regular intervals. I argued then and I repeat now that this was far too important an issue to be left to regulations. It is an area where we have to make up our minds and act decisively. That is what I have done and I am proud to be the Minister who has made this decision.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Bill dipped its toes into the area of restorative justice. Admittedly, at the time the 1996 Bill was being prepared restorative justice was a relatively new concept and few studies had been done on its efficacy. It seemed to be a concept that had real possibilities and I, therefore, asked my officials to thoroughly research how restorative justice provisions were operating in other jurisdictions. The outcome was encouraging and the result can now be seen in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The decision to place the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis has been retained but the family conference which was to have been an integral part of that programme has been greatly expanded so that it now incorporates within its parameters modern restorative justice measures. The primary focus of the conference <Col N="36" /> will be on issues of accountability rather than welfare. It will be convened by the Garda Síochána and will formulate an action plan for the child in respect of whom it has been convened. The action plan may include provision for many matters, including the making of an apology or financial or other reparation to the victim. It can also include provisions relating to the child's lifestyle such as his or her attendance at school or participation in appropriate sporting or recreational activities. In practical terms the range of possibilities is almost limitless, as long as they are agreed to by the persons present at the conference. The action plan is no easy option but it has the advantage of involving the child and his or her family in the decision making process and of being a party to the decision. This will increase the likelihood of compliance.</P>
    <P>The victim of the child's offending may be invited to attend the conference and, if the victim does attend, the child will be confronted by the consequences of his or her criminal behaviour. Experience abroad suggests that the victim usually welcomes the opportunity of being present at the conference, and that is borne out in the pilot schemes being operated by the gardaí in preparation for the implementation of this legislation. Some victims will stress the value of expressing their feelings to the young offender and ensuring that the offender learns from the experience. Other victims will want to contribute to the offender's rehabilitation or to show their support for the process. Yet other victims will emphasise their own interests. They may want to make sure that things are done properly and to get reparation. They are all understandable and valid reactions. To underline the seriousness with which the action plan must be taken, it will be in the form of a contract. The facilitator for the Garda convened conference will always be a member of the Garda Síochána, usually a juvenile liaison officer or a community garda but, in a new approach in the Bill to conferencing, it will be possible in appropriate circumstances for the chairperson of the conference to be somebody other than a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Another innovation is a provision which will allow the victim to be present at the administration by the Garda Síochána of a formal caution. This is known as restorative cautioning and will be a suitable mini-conference type response in circumstances where a full conference is not warranted. It means that the child offender can be confronted with the consequences of his or her offending and be invited to apologise or make some form of reparation to the victim in a low key atmosphere. The Children Court is also being given a totally new role in implementing the restorative justice provisions in the Bill. The court will have the power to adjourn appropriate cases and direct the Probation and Welfare Service to convene family conferences as an alternative at that point to proceeding to a finding. An action plan formulated by the family conference will remain under court supervision and, for that <Col N="37" /> reason, will be enforceable. The court will, on the resumption of the case following completion of the plan, have the discretion to decide whether to proceed to a finding. Compliance by the child with the terms of the action plan will obviously be an important factor in the court's decision.</P>
    <P>To sum up on conferencing, children tend to be more open emotionally than adults, more quickly prepared to say sorry and mean it and less likely to stand on ceremony, attributes that make children particularly amenable to conferencing. It is also a particularly suitable way of dealing with the irritating anti-social behaviour exhibited by some young persons and, again, this is borne out in the pilot schemes. The court will also have the power to adjourn cases where it considers that a child's real problem is a need of care or protection, even though the child is before the court on a criminal charge. In such cases the relevant health board will be directed by the court to convene a family welfare conference in respect of the child. The health board will have to report back to the court on what action, if any, it intends to take, for example, it may apply for a care order, a supervision order or a special care order for the child or inform the court of any services or assistance which it intends to provide for the child and his or her family. As with the provision for family conferencing, the court will have the discretion as to whether it should proceed to a finding.</P>
    <P>The new powers I have just mentioned will enable the court to deal with children before it on criminal charges without proceeding to a finding, and where the finding would have been one of guilt the consequences of that will be avoided. Where the court proceeds to a finding of guilt, it is being given an array of new imaginative community sanctions which it may impose. Of the ten community sanctions provided in the Bill, eight are new. It is unnecessary at this stage to give details of those sanctions other than to say that their purpose is to ensure an appropriate and suitable sanction for each child whatever the child's needs or misdeeds. These sanctions are of the utmost importance in that they give tangible effect to the principle in the Bill that detention will be an option of absolute last resort.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing the debate and the Government and Opposition Whips for arranging the debate in an orderly manner.</P>
      <P>We are in the midst of the worst public transport dispute for more than 30 years. Dublin commuters are in the second day of a three day dispute, already having been deprived of buses on three days in the past few weeks. Today Bus Éireann services throughout the country have been withdrawn and mainline and DART services are virtually non-existent. Given the state of industrial relations within the CIE group, no one can be assured the buses will be back on the streets when the formal three day strike ends tomorrow. Whatever happens, we know that unless the Dublin Bus dispute is settled the buses will not operate for four days next week and that there will be an all-out strike shortly after that. I am anxious that we are not seen to make a political football of this issue. The purpose of the debate should be to seek a means of finding a resolution.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hardship and inconvenience to those dependent on public transport has been immense. Some people are forced to walk to work while others are unable to get to work at all. Children, including those in examination years, are unable to get to school, those with medical appointments are unable to get to a hospital or a doctor, people are unable to visit relatives in hospital and there is huge disruption to economic and business life. It is clear that unless action is taken to secure an early settlement to the dispute, enormous damage will be done and hardship caused. It is evident by the empty streets in Dublin this morning that large numbers of people were unable to get to their places of work. While the situation has been spiralling downwards into chaos, the responsible <Col N="39" /> Government Ministers have been content to play the role of spectators, content to do nothing other than tut-tut about the consequences of the dispute and, in some cases, send their political stalking horses out to make unhelpful and inflammatory statements.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who has overall responsibility for public transport and who is the shareholder, on behalf of the public, in CIE seems more interested in waging a political battle against perceived opponents on the board of the company than in restoring morale in the company and creating an atmosphere conducive to a settlement. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has overall responsibility for industrial relations issues, has shown not one whit of interest in the dispute. This strike could be happening in Timbuktu for all the Tánaiste appears to care.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Public Enterprise were elected to govern. That involves dealing with difficult issues like transport disputes, as well as making the good news announcements of new projects and more spending. Where has the Taoiseach been while thousands of commuters are unceremoniously dumped on the roads? This is a politician who cut his teeth and largely built his political reputation as a fixer of difficult disputes when he was Minister for Labour. The Taoiseach makes himself available for innumerable photo opportunities, but the public, including Fianna Fáil voters, might be more impressed if he devoted his considerable skills to finding a solution to this dispute.</P>
    <P>While the Government may be able to claim it was taken by surprise by the sudden unofficial dispute involving engineering staff in Irish Rail, it had plenty of advance notice of the Dublin Bus dispute. This dispute has been simmering for months. The claim was first lodged last August and the buses were first taken off in February. A month's grace was secured to try to resolve the difficulties. Nothing happened and it was entirely predictable, given the anger among members of the NBRU, that the dispute would escalate. I uphold the right of NBRU members to take official industrial action in pursuit of their claim. The right to strike and the right to withdraw labour is an essential component in any democratic society. I do not believe it is in anyone's interest for workers to take unofficial action. These actions simply add to the complexity of disputes and make settlements even more difficult. However, I am not going to join in the sanctimonious denunciations of low paid public transport workers by commentators who probably spend more in a week on expenses than CIE workers get in the weekly pay packets.</P>
    <P>Transport workers must also consider the long-term impact of prolonged disputes, especially unofficial actions. During the 1970s and 1980s, the image of public transport suffered greatly from repeated industrial disputes. In recent years, <Col N="40" /> it has managed to remain largely strike free and with the introduction of additional vehicles and welcome innovations like the Quality Bus Corridors, confidence in public transport is recovering and more and more commuters are using buses. Against this background, what has happened in recent weeks has been a serious setback.</P>
    <P>Driving large buses in Dublin traffic conditions is a demanding and stressful occupation. The wage structure should reflect this. A basic starting salary of £207 per week, which is approximately £30 more than the statutory minimum wage that will apply from 1 April, going up to £273, does not reflect this. It is clear that part of the reason for this dispute is that bus workers do not believe the work they do is reflected in the current wage scales. The result of the low basic pay is that drivers must work many hours overtime to earn a decent wage. Apart from the safety aspects of drivers working 60 or 70 hours per week, it is likely that the extension of the EU Working Time Directive to the transport sector in the near future will limit the maximum working week to around 48 hours, resulting in reduced overtime working. Working patterns based on an overtime culture have had their day.</P>
    <P>Ironically, there seems to be a general consensus that the basic pay of bus drivers is too low. The issue is how to deal with it. It has to be accepted that in this day and age, wage increases over and above those provided for in national agreements, have to be paid for through productivity improvements. Much progress has been made in this area and the drivers seem to have got little credit for it. It is important for instance to remember that ten years ago there were two workers &ndash; a driver and conductor &ndash; doing the work now done by a single driver. There are not many sectors of which this can be said.</P>
    <P>The General Secretary of the NBRU has already said that he has identified savings of up to £2 million which, if matched by Dublin Bus, might provide a basis for re-opening discussions. This position has been supported by SIPTU. Why can negotiations not be re-opened on this basis? Goodwill is required on both sides. A commitment by Dublin Bus to pay, as an interim increase for a further six months, the £15 which has been paid for the past four weeks, would be helpful. There is clearly a need for outside intervention to bring the parties together to prepare a productivity package, based not just on concessions by the workers, but also on substantially increased investment in the company.</P>
    <P>Workers also believe the culture of low pay in the company arises from the very low subsidy received from the Exchequer, one of the lowest for any public transport system for a European city of comparable size. The level of subsidy amounts to no more than around 4p per passenger journey. I appeal to the Minister and to her fellow Ministers in Government to govern and to find a mechanism now to bring the parties to this dispute back to the table. If the dispute is allowed to continue and fester, it will put the newly nego<Col N="41" /> tiated national wage agreement at serious risk. I do not believe we can afford this. Neither can we afford a situation where drivers of complex machines, that have to carry up to 70 passengers around our congested city, are asked to work on the basis that they must work 70 to 80 hours per week to achieve a living wage. Right across the board from the Taoiseach to the Minister to commentators and unions everybody says that wage rate is not adequate. A mechanism must be found and the Minister must put policies and funding in place to ensure a solution is found. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the measured way in which Deputy Stagg has addressed the issue and the way in which it was addressed yesterday. He said he did not wish to make the issue a political football and that is the best approach. He said nothing had happened since last August when the NBRU tabled its first claim for a 20% pay claim. In fact a study had been agreed by Mr. Healy of the NBRU. When he produced his study the union did not accept it as suitable for further discussion. The bottom two rungs have been taken away. On a point of clarification, 1,600 out of 2,000 drivers have minimum guaranteed earnings of £341 for a 38 hour shift, excluding overtime. That is a fact and not a drummed up statistic. The debate could still centre around whether that is too low.</P>
      <P>Virtually all the public transport system is at a standstill today. The result is that more than 400,000, perhaps 500,000, public transport users have been severely inconvenienced, something everybody regrets and for which I extend my apologies.</P>
      <P>The disruption today arises from three separate sources. Dublin Bus drivers are on official strike in support of their 20% pay claim. Other public transport workers have taken unofficial secondary action in support of the Dublin Bus claim. Iarnród Éireann permanent way staff have taken unofficial strike action in a separate dispute.</P>
      <P>The unofficial and secondary industrial action is a matter of grave concern. It will do nothing to help resolve the disputes. In fact it is hindering their resolution. It is also resulting in severe inconvenience to the travelling public and disruption to the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on the Dublin Bus dispute has not changed. We believe agreement is possible. We believe there is scope for more pay provided it has its basis in genuine productivity and restructuring measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the earlier negotiations, the NBRU proposed measures which, if agreed and fully implemented, would generate savings of about £2 million. This is out of the total of more than £9 million which would be required to meet their 20% pay claim in full. At the same talks, Dublin Bus made it clear that it was prepared to seriously address the pay claim. It tabled productivity proposals which would generate cost savings in <Col N="42" /> excess of the required £9 million, without the need for any job losses or any impact on earnings.</P>
    <P>The proposals tabled by both the NBRU and Dublin Bus can provide a basis for the resumption of negotiations. The State's industrial relations machinery remains available to assist. However, it only makes sense for it to become involved when it is satisfied that a basis exists for resumed negotiations.</P>
    <P>The secondary action which has been taken in support of the Dublin Bus claim is not helpful. It will do nothing to advance the resolution of the dispute. It is involving the staff of both Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann who are not in dispute with their companies. It has disrupted the lives of many thousands of public transport users and has created serious difficulties for their colleague workers across the country.</P>
    <P>The message on the Dublin Bus dispute is suspend the strike and resume negotiations. There are both union and management proposals already on the table which can form the basis for serious negotiations, provided there is a willingness to negotiate. If these negotiations can make real progress in addressing the basic pay aspirations of the Dublin Bus drivers, wider issues can be considered. The starting point for these negotiations has to be a serious and sustained review of all the options for efficiencies and cost reductions. The scope exists to generate substantial cost savings which can be used to finance an increase in basic pay without the need for job losses or any impact on earnings.</P>
    <P>Permanent way staff in Iarnród Éireann have also gone on unofficial strike. They placed pickets on a number of depots across the country which led to the cancellation and curtailment of both mainline and suburban rail services yesterday. Today it has been subsumed in the wider disruption of services.</P>
    <P>One of the jobs which the permanent way staff carry out is the regular patrolling of track. These patrols are necessary to ensure the safe operation of rail services and are most frequent on the older jointed track. One of the first effects of this unofficial action was that Iarnród Éireann had to introduce speed restrictions for safety reasons where safety patrols of the track were not being undertaken. Speed restrictions of 30 m.p.h. were applied yesterday to uninspected jointed track to ensure continued safe operation. If this dispute continues it will quickly become impossible, for safety reasons, to run services on uninspected track. This will most immediately impact on jointed tracks but continuous welded rail track would also be affected if the dispute lasted.</P>
    <P>The dispute, as mentioned by Deputy Stagg and Deputy Bruton earlier, arises from the rejection, without a ballot, of a restructuring package for permanent way staff which was the subject of a recent Labour Court recommendation. In return for changes in working practices, the package would have given a 12.5% increase now, with a further 7.5% increase nine months later.</P>
    <P>If this unofficial action is ended, negotiations <Col N="43" /> can begin immediately to find a resolution to the issues in dispute. I am aware that in those circumstances the Labour Court would also be available to clarify any matters arising from its original recommendation.</P>
    <P>The current disruption is contrary to the partnership process which Government and the social partners have built up over the past decade and which has provided the platform for the economic success enjoyed today. The Government cannot countenance measures which are contrary to the partnership agreements which everyone has so painstakingly negotiated.</P>

      <P>We are facing the worst public transport crisis in living memory. Today there is total paralysis of Dublin Bus, DART, inter-city bus and rail services, in other words, a complete shutdown. This, in an advanced economy, is simply intolerable and unacceptable. I call on the Minister and the Government to set aside, for the duration of the dispute, a position where CIE's monopoly would no longer pertain and other essential services would be put in place. It is not enough to articulate the hardship caused to students, commuters generally, those getting to health appointments and other critical services. If CIE cannot do the job there is an obligation to let others do it. The Minister's position is untenable. Her position, as articulated yesterday, is that she will not intervene in the dispute and she is opposed to introducing alternative contingency measures. If she is opposed to either of those, I can only categorise hers as a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; position which has led to total paralysis.</P>
      <P>It is important to look for the seeds of this dispute. I have said repeatedly that they lie in the situation of July 1997 when the Imp bus dispute in Bus Éireann resulted in ministerial political intervention. This said to CIE workers that in the case of a serious industrial relations dispute they should not go to management or use the industrial relations procedures because the Minister is boss and will settle all disputes. The resulting raised expectations has led to in today's woe. The current dispute has developed into one between the NBRU, led by Peter Bunting, and the Government. The union is confronting the Government head on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that NBRU workers in Dublin Bus were led to believe that in the introductory phase of competition, public service contracts would be introduced to give a comfort zone of two or three years to Dublin Bus. I am told that in the last few weeks, perhaps because of Progressive Democrat pressure in Cabinet or on the Attorney General's advice, this plan has been <Col N="44" /> scrapped and public service contacts ripped up. This has been a contributory factor to this dispute.</P>
    <P>At every conceivable opportunity in Dáil debates and at meetings of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, I have said what the Minister should do. She should publish a White Paper on transport setting out a reform of the 1932 Act. For intercity and rural services the Minister should set up the equivalent of the Independent Radio and Television Commission which has successfully re-regulated independent radio which was also chaotic. In Dublin a franchise system of competition is needed similar to that in London. Dublin Bus would be similar to the red bus company in London under whose bonnet 11 different companies have successfully tendered for different routes. The advent of competition has been dealt with well in some countries and poorly in others.</P>
    <P>A menu has been facing the Minister and the Government for the past two and a half years from which they must select the optimum method of competition. The fact that we have not progressed the introduction of competition has allowed a position to develop where the country can be held to ransom by a relatively small group of people. Those are the contributory reasons for the dispute and those fundamental policy questions will not go away.</P>
    <P>There is a clear solution to the dispute. I was told that if First Bus or Stagecoach began to operate in Dublin they would deal with Peter Bunting by offering a good flat rate of basic pay for a 30 hour week and abolishing Sunday and shift bonuses, the daily allowance, the car differential and all the incremental payments. That is how the dispute will be solved. The pay structure in Dublin Bus must be sorted out on a modern, competitive, flat rate basis. This will improve pay and conditions for workers but it will do so on the basis of removing some of the restrictive practices, inflexibilities and demarcations which currently exist. The Minister should be pushing in this direction at a policy level if the dispute is to be resolved.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the permanent way dispute is that it arises because people are not prepared to work beside sub-contractors who are carrying out the rail safety programme. I am told CIE does not have the plant and equipment to carry out much of this work. Once the Government accepted the IRMS safety report, it was inevitable that specialists would have to be used.</P>
    <P>Only last Friday 550,000 workers and IBEC endorsed the Programme for Productivity and Fairness. On page 35 of the agreement provides, &ldquo;that no cost increasing claims by trade unions or employees for improvements in pay or conditions of employment other than those provided in clauses 3 and 5 will be made or processed during the currency of this agreement&rdquo;. Later the document says the agreement, &ldquo;precludes strikes or other forms of industrial action by trade unions, employees or employers in respect of any matters <Col N="45" /> covered by this agreement where the employer or trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of this agreement&rdquo;. This dispute was referred to the Labour Relations Commission, a pay increase of 20% has been put forward and there has not even been a ballot on the claim. The authority of SIPTU and the ICTU is being overtly challenged. We must adhere to agreements. If the Government or CIE were in breach of an agreement I would be equally critical. Those agreements must be honoured.</P>
    <P>This dispute shows a laxity in the rigour and discipline of industrial relations in CIE. Secondary picketing and unofficial action have led to a total paralysis of the railways. The majority of people who are in dispute today have no grievance with CIE. The rail drivers and Bus Éireann drivers have no grievance with CIE yet they are not driving their trains or buses today. If this pay increase of 20% is conceded in a straightforward fashion it is inevitable that other bus and rail drivers will seek an equal increase because the stress and pressure which is suffered by Dublin Bus drivers is also suffered by other bus and train drivers.</P>
    <P>I am utterly confused. When Mr. Joyce resigned I read in a Sunday newspaper that the Minister planned to split up CIE. In another newspaper I read that officials were in discussion with a UK company to privatise CIE. I read that the Government had made a decision to look again at the previous Government's decision on Luas. In May 1998 the Minister decided to go ahead with Luas and I now read that Luas will not proceed within the family of CIE. I have read of a £4 billion metro plan for Dublin. I do not know where we are going on a project or policy basis. We also have leaks and rumours but I will not discuss those.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's job to provide the resources, the investment, the policy context and a clear sense of direction. I want the same modern public transport system which the rest of Europe enjoys and EU directives will soon make this obligatory in many cases. The Government should immediately provide the basis of some independent productivity expertise to trade off all the premia allowances and bonus payments for a proper flat rate of pay to deal with the Dublin Bus situation. The PPF must be honoured and, in relation to the permanent way dispute, procedures in essential services must be honoured.</P>
    <P>The Government has an obligation to govern. If there is an attempt to blackmail the country and bring it to a standstill the Government should suspend the 1932 Act and allow other bus providers to carry out some essential services on a stop gap basis as a prelude to a proper introduction of competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I place the entire responsibility for this strike in the hands of the Minister. She has single-handedly brought the country to a standstill. We call for contingency plans but it is <Col N="46" /> fanciful to expect a contingency plan when we do not have a mainstream transport plan.</P>
      <P>This strike will be resolved but not without a great deal of inconvenience and hardship to the public and incalculable cost to business and the economy. Resolving this strike, urgent though that is, will only treat a symptom of a much deeper problem which will continue to manifest itself in industrial action unless the Minister tackles its root causes.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have failed to make decisions about the future of CIE and transport delivery. The Minister has been warned in this House, in other fora and by other agencies of the growth in transport needs and of the total inadequacy of the institutional and structural arrangements to deliver a transport plan. Due to under-investment and the Minister's failure to give it any direction, CIE is incapable of delivering a transport plan. Of course, we do not have a transport plan and if we had one we have no agency to deliver it. CIE is effectively in the throes of death, murdered by abuse and neglect on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Over £2 billion has been put aside for public transport in the national development plan but not a single decision has been made on how and by whom it is to be spent. For over three years the Minister has engaged in diversionary tactics and play acting with Deputies, alternatively expressing herself in favour of public enterprise, privatisation, competition, public-private partnerships and, most recently, breaking the company into its constituent parts. Any decision or direction would be welcome at this stage. Is it any wonder that CIE is on its knees with no direction or certainty about its future and that morale is at an all time low having lost workers, management and chairmen? Is it any wonder that we are dealing with not one but a series of strikes which are taking place in only one sector of the economy &ndash; the transport sector &ndash; and entirely due to ministerial failure? Meanwhile the Minister has established quangos and appointed consultants and advisers who are leaking conflicting transport plans. There is a plan virtually every week designed to mask the reality that the Minister is incapable of making a decision. She has no strategy or plan and, even if she had, there is no one available to implement it.</P>
      <P>This dispute will be resolved but not without much inconvenience to the public. Will the Minister start by making short-term decisions to allow competition on the streets? The buses operating to Dublin Airport and Leopardstown &ndash; the Icon service &ndash; are empty because of the ludicrous and oudated rule that they are not allowed to pick up and drop off passengers. This rule should be changed, at least for the duration of the strike, which proves, if proof were needed, the need for competition in public transport services. This should the last occasion on which citizens are left completely dependent on the uncertain services of a monopoly transport provider.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The low wage regime which successive Governments have used to subsidise the public transport system has finally and inevitably blown up in the face of the Government. The patience of bus drivers and other workers in the public transport system has finally run out. The Government is totally responsible for the strike and the acute inconvenience to hundreds of thousands of public transport users.</P>
      <P>The strike breaking call this morning by IBEC that the Army and private bus operators be used to break the strike expresses the breathtaking arrogance of the captains of industry. For 13 years of so-called social partnership they have grown fat on massive profits while wage increases for low paid workers, including transport workers, have been pegged to the absolute minimum. IBEC represents the speculators who in four short years have put a modest home out of the reach of virtually every public transport worker who is unlucky enough to be a first time house buyer or starting a family. IBEC also represents private landlords who rack-rent to the point where the rent on a modest bedsitter in Dublin accounts for half the weekly wages of a transport worker.</P>
      <P>Did the Government and IBEC seriously expect low paid workers to go on having their economic lifeblood sucked out of them in this way without a response? Farmers were right to take on the greedy beef barons who were abusing them and there were no half measures. The iron is now in the fire and it should stay there until a solution is found to the problem of low pay in the public transport system which should be adequately subsidised by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what Fine Gael said this morning that politicians are one million years removed from the suffering of low paid workers. It is also seeking strike breaking measures. An all out transport strike is the quickest way to make politicians and the Minister in particular realise the seriousness of the situation and force the Government and CIE management to provide a decent and just wage for bus drivers who are among the most exploited in the economy. They should also demand the introduction of a realistic long-term public transport investment programme.</P>
      <P>IBEC's strike breaking call should be treated with contempt. How dare it try to use rank and file soldiers who are low paid workers in uniform as its door mats to impose a low wage regime on public transport workers? Soldiers should greet any such cynical attempt with a massive go sick protest. They should not allow themselves to be used in such a cynical way. It is in the interests of suffering public transport users and low paid public transport workers who depend on each other that bus drivers win a decent wage, that other low paid public transport workers are also adequately paid and that there is a long-term investment public transport programme providing for the introduction of new rail services and proper and decent wages for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Will the Minister please stop misrepresenting the position on bus drivers' pay? It is not true that they can earn £341 for a 38 hour week. They start on a basic of £207 per week which, with a shift bonus for working unsocial hours, including Sundays, rises to £276. After six years service the basic is £273 which with a shift bonus rises to a maxium of £322. The Minister is involved in a propaganda war to make people believe that the workers concerned are not low paid and are not being exploited. The reality is that bus drivers perform an enormously difficult and responsible task for derisory wages which Ministers spend at lunchtime with a few of their guests. This system has to be rooted out and that is the only way the dispute will be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who do not depend on public transport do not understand the severity of the crisis. Many students, workers, hospital outpatients and shoppers are at home awaiting a resolution of this dispute. As I cycled past the Taoiseach's office in Drumcondra where his car was parked on the footpath I wondered from where the vision and leadership would come in providing a proper level of pay in the public transport sector.</P>
      <P>It is agreed that bus drivers are poorly paid. CIE management informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that it cannot afford to provide the proper level of pay because it does not receive the necessary funding from the Government. As a consequence, industrial relations are unstable and work practices which are based on overtime present dangers for bus drivers as they lead to tiredness.</P>
      <P>The public will not wear increased fares, which are already high by international comparisons, for a service that is inadequate. The alternative is to increase the subvention of £100 million which has been declining in real terms since 1985. As was  stated earlier, only 4% of the fare comes from the Government. The cost of congestion is rated at £2 billion. Therefore, a sum comparable with 5% of the cost of the annual congestion is going on the subvention. It does not sound like economic sense to starve the public transport sector in this way.</P>
      <P>There is £2 billion for public transport and £6 billion for the NRA for the next six years, which is more than the authority wanted in the national development plan &ndash; it had in mind a 20 year plan rather than a six year plan. The Government is failing and neglecting public transport. It is causing this strike by its lack of vision in public transport. There is no leadership and no vision of what is needed either from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, or the management, which was asked to provide that prior to the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Trasportation Office report, which has not been published but certainly has been leaked, estimates that by 2016 there will be a <Col N="49" /> need for five times the capacity which is being planned for in public transport. Clearly this is the tip of a huge problem but it is, in itself, causing chaos.</P>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise is only now conducting a national rail needs study whereas the NRA had its study done before the national development plan. There is a catch-up game going on and Deputy O'Rourke, as Minister, is responsible for the appalling neglect which is causing the strike and giving rise to greater problems down the road.</P>
    <P>The private sector is paying far more for drivers and, therefore, naturally there will be a continuing crisis in CIE. Bus capacity, the provision in the plans for which, as I said, will need to be increased approximately fivefold, will mean that CIE will not be able to get drivers. Whatever about the drivers who are currently being lowly paid, there will be no drivers available to cater for that extra capacity because there is a problem getting drivers at present.</P>
    <P>I want to bring home to the Minister that this is not just a question of low pay. It is a question of an overtime culture giving rise to tiredness, truculence in industrial relations and a situation where the public is being forced to stay at home, the economy is losing £2 billion a year due to congestion and the Minister has a considerable amount of work to do. I ask the Minister to back off the telecommunications sector, which has preoccupied her mind for a while, and put her efforts solidly behind the vision and leadership which is needed in the public transport sector, primarily to lift the lowly paid workers out of the abyss of misery in which they find themselves. They cannot afford to raise a family, purchase a home or lead a normal life. They are subjected to work which gives rise to enormous tiredness that endangers both them and the public. Unless this matter is resolved, ultimately it will bring down the Government.</P>

There is scope for considerable enhancement of employees' wages and salaries if we go the route of productivity. That is the route which we must go. Therein lies, in my estimation and in the belief of the Government, the way to enhancing the basic salary.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Higgins, I am telling the truth because this information has been given to me by Dublin Bus. I am not saying that it is a wonderful wage &ndash; far from it &ndash; but I am stating the facts, that 1,600 of 2,000 drivers have minimum guaranteed earnings of £341 for a standard 38 hour shift excluding overtime and of course working five days out of seven because it is a seven day operation.</P>

Will she confirm or deny that the measures, or the strings attached as she later mentioned, would include acceptance of the changes she is proposing to the 1932 Act and that that is part of the package which she is effectively holding over the head of the union?

We followed this with public advertising in the newspapers asking for submissions which were received. The Department is engaged in consultations with the unions on their submissions. I met the unions two weeks ago and we talked about competition. There is nothing covert about this &ndash; it is quite open.

I cannot understand an ideology which prefers to have the public walking beside empty buses rather than using them. Private bus services, such as Icon and Aircoach, are on the streets but are not allowed pick up passengers. Allowing them do so would lessen in some small way the inconvenience and genuine hardship being experienced by the public.</P>

Will the Minister agree that permanent staff in Iarnróid Éireann have a basic wage of between £210 and £227 per week? Does the Minister for Finance agree with the Minister that a 20% increase for these low paid workers would be unjustified when last summer he believed that Deputies should get an increase of 25%, starting from a much higher level than very low paid bus workers?</P>

In light of this will the Minister examine the policy on State subvention for public transport and look at other European countries to see how they subvent public transport services? Will she implement as quickly as possible the long promised social contracts for CIE to operate the social routes?</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Wall has tabled a question today about this. Three months ago I asked the Department to engage somebody to examine the policy on subvention. It engaged a person from UCD. When the report is given to me we will debate it, I hope, in the House. The effect of giving 20% without any strings or productivity talks would have huge repercussions right across the public and every other sector. It is not tenable for this or any Government to hand out 20% without engaging in productivity talks. The people who have been hugely inconvenienced would not thank a Government that went down the path of giving huge increases without any return in productivity. I have put the study in train and when I receive the report I will discuss it in the House.</P>

Does she know that many people working in the Houses of the Oireachtas do not know how they will travel home tonight or travel to and from work tomorrow because trains and buses will not run for safety and other reasons? When she says that she is keeping alternative measures under review, what level of hardship will make her change her stance? She made it quite clear that she will not concede the pay demand and she has been absolutely straight about that. At what point will she alleviate the hardship caused? Will it be after a three or four day strike or an all out strike? We have surely reached the point where <Col N="55" /> the level of hardship is so intolerable that alternatives must be found.</P>

      <P>This morning I gave a lift to a number of people who were trying to get to work. I also spoke to some strikers outside a bus garage in Dublin, one of whom is in receipt of family income supplement. None of them wanted to be on strike and they wanted this issue brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Will the Minister, in the context of a tripartite agreement between the workers, the company and herself, on behalf of the Government, confirm whether the low subsidy which the company receives from the Exchequer can form part of the resolution to the dispute? If so, will she make the negotiators aware of her position in this?</P>
      <P>If this House is to be relevant in regard to what is happening whereby people are unable to travel to work or get home in the evening, will the Minister give a commitment to arrange for negotiations, which at the end of the day will resolve the dispute, to commence before the dispute gets out of control completely? While the Minister is prepared to enjoy the positive aspects of transport policy, the ball is in her court and she must accept her role in this and get negotiations under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission, which comprises professional negotiators, has stated that it is willing to resume negotiations. I stated clearly that the figure of £2 million already put forward by the NBRU can form the basis for such negotiations. I understand that the low subsidy has already been discussed in the context of the earlier negotiations. The study that was carried out by Mr. Healy under the aegis of the Labour Court dwelt on that subject while the study being undertaken by UCD for the Department, which is focusing on comparable levels of subsidy across Europe will tell its story when it is published. I have not even received a draft of it and, therefore, cannot comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive the study yet. Apart from subsidising the employees of the company, there is also a need to upgrade the services for commuters and, therefore, the subsidy can be used in many ways. There is a need to examine different routes operated by Dublin Bus because <Col N="56" /> many of them are based on outdated demographic figures and many new towns are within the company's scope. That would also form part of the examination of the subsidy. The subsidy was £3.6 million when the rainbow coalition left office and it is currently £13.4 million. It increased by 43% this year in comparison to last year. It is obviously still not enough.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that many parents of difficult and out-of-control children are devastated and often bewildered by their children's anti-social behaviour. They do their best as parents, however inadequate that might be, but most people are also aware that some parents have a totally irresponsible attitude towards controlling their children. Effectively, they opt out of their responsibilities, sometimes to indulge their own ill-disciplined lifestyles. The Bill has three provisions dealing specifically with such parents. First, the parents can be bound over to exercise proper and adequate control over their child where that child has been found guilty of an offence. Second, the parents can be ordered to pay compensation. Before making a compensation order the court must be satisfied of the parents' ability to pay and that there was a wilful failure on the part of the parents to take care of or to control the child that contributed to the child's behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third and new provision is one under which the court can make a parental supervision order. As with the compensation order, this order can only be imposed on parents where their child is found guilty of an offence and where the court is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or to control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour. This order provides the court with a carrot and stick option for dealing with such parents. For example, if the court is of the opinion that the parents lack the necessary skills to properly look after their child, it can order the parents to undergo a parenting skills course. Similarly, if the problem is one of substance abuse, the court can order the parents to seek treatment for that abuse. As with all the other orders and powers of the court in the Bill, this order will not be suitable in all circumstances &ndash; it might be a suitable response in a relatively small number of cases. It is important, however, <Col N="57" /> to give the courts power to deal with whatever situation confronts them.</P>
    <P>In formulating the policy on which the Bill is based, I have had to strike a fair balance between the needs and interests of the child offender with the protection of the community and what is good generally for society. I have already spoken of victims in the context of the conference. Their position is highlighted and protected throughout the Bill. The principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children specifically protect the interests of victims of child offending and both the Garda convened conference and the family conference which will be convened by the Probation and Welfare Service will be obliged to uphold the concerns of the victim and to have due regard to his or her rights.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the three Parts of the Bill which specifically relate to the health area. These are Part 2, which is completely new and establishes for the first time on a statutory basis the family welfare conference, which will enable health boards to intervene with other agencies at an early stage in relation to children who need special care and protection.</P>
    <P>The second is Part 3, which amends the Child Care Act, 1991, to impose a duty on health boards to apply for a special care order or an interim special care order in relation to a child residing or found in its area who is in need of special care and protection which he or she is not likely to receive unless the court grants such an order.</P>
    <P>The third is Part 11, which provides for the establishment of a special residential services board to co-ordinate residential services for children detained in detention schools and in special care units. I am particularly pleased that the Bill will establish family welfare conferences on a statutory basis to deal with those children who have been charged with an offence and referred to the health boards by the courts, and those children who are the subject of applications for special care orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited East Timor on Thursday, 9 March. I met Mr. Sergio de Mello, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and head of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET. I also met CNRT leaders, Mr. Xanana Gusmao and Mr. José Ramos Horta, as well as the deputy commander of the UN peacekeeping force, the local commander in the south-west border region where the Irish troops are based, and some of the Irish troops.</P>
      <P>A recurring theme throughout my meetings in East Timor was concern at the security situation. In recent times, especially since the beginning of this month, there has been a marked increase in the number of armed incursions by pro-integration militias based in West Timor. UN peacekeeping troops have come under increasing attack from these elements. These attacks seem to be intended to undermine UNTAET and to intimidate the East Timorese people. All my interlocutors were in agreement that these operations are taking place with the complicity of local units of the Indonesian army in West Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently wrote to President Wahid of Indonesia to express to him my concerns, and those of the Government, at the renewed attacks, and to convey the concerns of those to whom I had spoken in East Timor. I requested him to take urgent action to halt the incursions. I am satisfied as to the President's goodwill in relation to bringing about a reconciliation between the peoples of the region, and made my request to him in that context. I also raised the matter with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whom I met in Washington on St. Patrick's Day, and the matter was brought to the attention of our EU partners by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday 20 March. I hope the Indonesian Government will not waste any time in putting a stop to these incursions. In this context, recent Indonesian press reports indicate that <Col N="60" /> the military, on the instructions of President Wahid, have already promised tightened security in the border region.</P>
    <P>During my meeting with Mr. Xanana Gusmao and Mr. José Ramos Horta, they expressed their great appreciation for Ireland's support, both now and in the past. They paid tribute, in particular, to the work of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. The House will recall that Ireland was one of a few countries visited by Mr. Gusmao last October, within a short time after his release from house arrest in Jakarta and before his return to East Timor. Both he and Mr. Horta were particularly pleased with my visit now, as it was the first visit at prime ministerial level from any country from outside the region to a free East Timor.</P>
    <P>I visited the members of the Defence Forces serving with the UN peacekeeping force. These are stationed in the south-west of the territory, close to the border with West Timor, and they gave a first hand account of the militia incursions. They are doing an excellent job in difficult conditions. Both the local UN commander, Brigadier General Lewis, and the Deputy Force Commander, General Mike Smith, were highly complimentary about the Irish troops.</P>
    <P>While I was in East Timor, I announced that the Irish Government has decided to open an aid office in Dili, to manage our programme of assistance and to support the East Timorese people to make a successful transition to full independence. This announcement was welcomed by everyone with whom I spoke in Dili.</P>
    <P>During my visit, I was struck by the total devastation of the territory. This seems to have been done in a deliberate and orchestrated manner. I pay tribute to the efforts which the non-governmental organisations, including our own GOAL and Concern, are making to provide the people of East Timor with the basic necessities of life and to help them with the enormous task of reconstruction. I was pleased to be able to meet representatives of the Irish NGOs working in East Timor and Irish nationals working with the UN and other bodies.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Australia, I met the Prime Minister Mr. John Howard. We discussed matters of mutual interest, including the ongoing response of the international community to the situation in East Timor, economic and cultural ties between Ireland and Australia, Australian relations with the EU and the status of the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also had a brief meeting with the Governor General, Sir William Deane, and we exchanged views on relations between Ireland and Australia. I met the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Kim Beazley, and shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr. Laurie Brereton. In the course of our discussions they expressed their support for and interest in the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>My visit also included meetings with the Premiers of the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Mr. Steve Bracks and Mr. Bob Carr, and <Col N="61" /> with the Chief Minister and the Administrator of the Northern Territories, Mr. Denis Burke and Dr. Neil Conn. In all these meetings I was impressed, both by the level of awareness of Irish affairs and the continuing Australian interest in the maintenance and development of the traditional links, both cultural and economic, between Ireland and Australia. All those with whom I met appreciated the positive contribution which Irish people have made to Australian society.</P>
    <P>In addition to these meetings, I had the opportunity to address and meet business leaders and community representatives at a range of functions. In Canberra, I attended a parliamentary dinner hosted by the Prime Minister, Mr. Howard. I took this opportunity to renew my thanks for the support given by Australia to the peace process. I also delivered an address &ndash; Prosperity and Fairness: An Irish vision for the 21st Century &ndash; at the National Press Club.</P>
    <P>In Melbourne, I launched the Bord Fáilte travel trade manual for Australia and addressed the Australia-Ireland chamber of commerce and industry. In Sydney, I inaugurated the premises of the new Ireland House, which will accommodate the consulate, Enterprise Ireland and IDA representatives. I also addressed a large group of business leaders at a business breakfast hosted by the Lansdowne Club and, together with many representatives of the Irish community, I attended a peace mass at St. Mary's Cathedral.</P>
    <P>Throughout the visit, I had the opportunity to view at first hand a number of Australian projects which are of interest in an Irish context. These included, as the first engagement in my programme, Kormilda College in Darwin, which is an exemplary school, not only as a model of racial integration and reconciliation, but also in the teaching of children with special needs, especially as regards literacy. In Melbourne, I visited an Irish welfare bureau, which is part-funded by the Irish Government and has a proud tradition over many years of assisting Irish people in Australia.</P>
    <P>Finally, in Sydney, I visited a migrant resource centre in Campsie. I take the opportunity to clarify again that, contrary to what was said in the media here, I did not visit a detention centre. The regrettable confusion over this has now been cleared up, and I am happy to note that spokesmen for both the UNHCR and the Refugee Council have expressed themselves happy with the clarification they have received. What I visited was a migrant resource centre, which is devoted to settling and integrating refugees and immigrants. The centre is run by the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and it provides newly arrived migrants with information on their rights and with support. It helps them to settle into their new communities and to participate in an equitable manner in society. It provides assistance in finding employment, including through the provision of language tuition and child care facilities. Interpretation and translation services are provided to help migrants with limited English language skills to gain access <Col N="62" /> to social, medical and community services. I was most impressed with what I saw at the centre, particularly the close degree of co-ordination and co-operation between different agencies and the progressive approach towards settlement and integration. We all recognise that taking people in and sending them out into a new society without integration supports is a poor policy, and Deputies will agree that this type of facility is one from which we can learn in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I visited the Olympic Stadium in Sydney in the company of the chief executive of the Irish Sports Council, Mr. John Treacy, and the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Paddy Teahon, who will be the executive chair of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited. It is a most impressive facility and I hope our athletes will distinguish themselves there in September. During my visit we were briefed on the planning and funding of the stadium project and on the facilities which have been put in place, both for the Olympics and for the continuing use of the stadium. In addition to my own briefing, further meetings took place at official level in the days following my visit.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I also met many members of the Irish community in the four cities which I visited in Australia.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach still be of the opinion that the Australian immigration system is, as he said in Australia, the best in the world? Did he say, in reference to centres which are part of the Australian system, to a journalist from <i>The Examiner</i> newspaper that in part of some of the centres at least, there is no question of anybody getting away from the centres until all processes are gone through? Would the Taoiseach agree that the assumption one would make about a place from which there is no possibility of getting away would normally be that that is a place in which one is detained?</P>

Has he withdrawn them, in the sense that he followed those words with words of approval when he said &ldquo;it is something you have to look at. You have to look very hard at the system&rdquo;? He used those two sentences immediately after his reference to a centre&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about this. I do not intend entering into another argument about it. In a question here on 29 February Deputy Quinn sensibly suggested that the Australian authorities had long experience in managing immigration policy to address skill shortages <Col N="63" /> in the domestic labour market, especially in the light of the multicultural programme in the area. I responded to that by saying I had included a number of matters related to that in my programme because I was interested to see how the integration system works. Deputy Bruton knows of my involvement in a number of projects in the city for the past four or five years with Vincentian groups and other groups who are trying to integrate asylum seekers and non-asylum seekers into life here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach misquoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Let me explain, it will only take a few moments. I looked at integrating immigrants and promoting multiculturalism. I looked at a unit that had been recommended to me both by the ambassador in Australia and also by a Dublin couple who were involved in setting up the centre. They spent their holidays here last year visiting FÁS, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Eastern Health Board setting out the benefits of the centre. They wrote a long letter to me saying that I should go to the centre. For both those reasons I did. Migrants are legally allowed into Australia under two streams. I went to see these settlement services and the range of services there. During the presentation of that, it was made clear to me by Senator Patterson that she believed the success of their integration system was because of the way in which they filtered people through it which is, in our definition, through the reception centres. Some people somewhere apparently called them detention centres but&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was on the other side of the world, I was accused of having a photo opportunity at a facility run by the Australian correction service, that I was in a detention location, that the prison services is the sponsor of <Col N="64" /> this service and I was accused of everything under the sun&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To this day I do not know much about the Australian detention service system. I did not see it but Senator Patterson in her presentation made a point that the success of their integration system owes much to the fact that it is streamlined in the way that it helps people get there. I said that was interesting, that it was food for thought and that we would look at it. I said we would take the manuals and examine it. I did that and if anyone wants to look at the manuals, they are in my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I corrected Deputy Bruton on his first point. I was not in a detention centre. Some of the Irish media followed him on that, not those travelling with me. They will know in future not to take their information from Fine Gael press statements because they know now that that was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which Deputy Bruton has being making in the past few weeks even since I came back is that I was at a press conference with the Irish journalists when I met the Prime Minister and that I was at a national press function and I should have clarified remarks made at home. Unfortunately that would have been difficult because both those events took place before the first reports in the media here. The criticism <Col N="65" /> from Opposition Members came afterwards. It would have been very hard for me to respond to comments made in the newspapers because when I gave those two interviews in Australia at those two events, one a press conference and the other a lunch, at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on 14 March, Australian time, which is midnight on 13 March and 3 a.m. here respectively. It was very difficult for me to clarify remarks reported in the morning papers several hours before the morning papers hit the streets which is the other point on which the Deputy is wrong.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of personal importance because I have been involved in several centres with regard to integration. The highest number of asylum seekers in this country is in my own constituency. For the past four years I have worked with all of the centres doing my utmost to convince people to integrate into the communities. I have been involved in most of the schools which are well known and have been well publicised. I have been involved in this not only in my own constituency but also south of the Liffey. I have been involved in the housing projects.</P>

The remarks were made, I said it was food for thought and that I would look at it. I said I would take the briefings and examine it and that we would make no decisions in this country.

      <P>On another matter, when the Taoiseach looked at the devastation in East Timor, which has been sponsored to such an extent by Ireland, did he feel embarrassed by the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, admitted that the Government will not meet its reduced target of 0.45% of GDP for overseas development aid? Now that we are a rich country, we are hopelessly behind in meeting the UN target of 0.7%. Bearing in mind the number of photo opportunities the Taoiseach has had in Third World countries, does he not feel slightly embarrassed, as the representative of a rich country, that we are not meeting the targets when we can afford it? Does that register with the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt immensely proud in East Timor. Everybody there, including the political leaders, are extremely grateful for the involvement of this country and the fact that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, from a country that is so far away, led the European case on this matter. He travelled twice to East Timor when it was most in need. He was there the week before the previous regime collapsed. We are opening an office in Dili and have already put in a substantial amount of resources. A further £2 million is being considered for the overseas development aid programme. On two other occasions an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been in East Timor concentrating on how the aid programme is working. I met representatives of the NGOs there who are extremely happy with the performance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the overseas development aid programme. My remarks about the ODA programme are on the record and we must continue to work on that. This country can be immensely proud of what we are doing through charitable and governmental organisations and through our UN peacekeeping force. This is also the case for what individuals do, whether religious or, in the case of East Timor, NGOs. Anyone would feel immensely proud of their role.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree we are doing less than was promised even though we have far more money with which to do it? All the organisations to which the Taoiseach just referred <Col N="69" /> are looking for extra resources. The Taoiseach could write a cheque for them in the morning. The Minister for Finance has written off £50 million for the horse racing industry. Did the Taoiseach not feel a little embarrassment on behalf of all those organisations which are doing so much in that we could give so much more so easily and effortlessly?</P>

Today, those areas look like Ireland did 100 years ago, as depicted in old photographs. An extraordinary input has been made by Irish people and of course they need resources. The assessment of the Department of Foreign Affairs was to set up an office in Dili to fund the NGOs, and that should be done.</P>

It is rather pathetic. Taking into account that the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Howard, was present on one occasion, the implication was that the Taoiseach could not disagree with aspects of Australia's immigration policy.

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach accept that his words could have been seen as grist to the mill for a backward minority in this country, appealing to a racist minority for votes in a very cynical way? Did the Taoiseach raise <Col N="70" /> with the Australian Government the recompense it is making to East Timor in view of the fact that that state colluded with the Indonesian regime for 25 years in the occupation of the country and in the repression of the East Timorese people in order to benefit from the massive oil bonanza in East Timor?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is no. That is not a fair assessment of those matters. Regarding the  second part of the Deputy's question, the Australian Government and Opposition have been very conscious of their country's relationship with East Timor for many years. They are doing all they can and that is why they made the decision to lead and go in very quickly to alleviate the plight of East Timor, though it was not easy for them. That was a change from a position they have held for a long time, but they did it. Whatever about the past, they made a brave decision when it was most needed and they will now continue as they plan to work on the economic regeneration and rehabilitation of East Timor, which is badly needed.</P>
      <P>The devastation in East Timor was worse than what I saw last year in Kosovo, though the latter was shelled. The difference was that every building was destroyed in Dili and into the countryside. East Timor will not be able to pick itself up with limited resources. It is a beautiful place but it is not developed because of the years of hardship it has endured and the pressure from Indonesia. I hope Australia will now be a friend to East Timor and will assist it in developing. There are important mineral reserves close by which could be of enormous assistance to the East Timorese, but that will only happen if Australia works with them. Already Darwin is becoming the centre of activity for much of the redevelopment of Dili and East Timor generally, whatever about the difficulties of the past. I do not think Australia will run away from those difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is well aware of the plight of Irish farmers. Did he say anything about the new round of GATT talks?

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that largely due to the activity of Tom Hyland and others during several Administrations and notwithstanding the extraordinary distance between the two countries, a bond of solidarity has grown <Col N="73" /> between the Irish and East Timorese peoples? If he accepts that, first, does he accept that East Timor will, sooner rather than later, become an independent state and a member of the United Nations and that Ireland should be to the fore of advocating that? Second, does he accept that we should include the Republic of East Timor as one of our preferred states for bilateral aid? Third, does he accept that we should elevate our office there sooner rather than later to embassy status? Fourth, does he accept that we should have a comprehensive and developed long-term &ndash; by which I mean a five to ten year &ndash; programme of support and solidarity with the East Timorese? Such a programme would fulfil the logic of the Taoiseach's visit to that soon to be declared state and the position adopted by my colleague and former leader, Deputy Spring, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, which was pursued very generously by Deputy Andrews, and would give to the East Timorese on the one hand and the Irish people on the other an expectation that our relationship should be consolidated and developed. Will the Government commit itself to that type of programme on foot of this opportunity or will the Taoiseach return to the House and comprehensively map out the intended relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the soon to be declared Republic of East Timor?</P>

        <b>:</b> In regard to his visit to East Timor and the other countries, will the Taoiseach ensure that any future Government policy will enunciate, as its first principle, the right of nations to self-determination and freedom from oppression? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that there are separate nationalities in Aceh, for example, which are still being hugely oppressed by Indonesia, the same regime to which Deputy Bruton wants us to be so sensitive? Does he agree that in our policy regarding that part of the world, the neo-imperialist doctrine enunciated by Deputy Bruton to the effect that we should be considerate to the Indonesian regime, which is repressing the nationality of Aceh having crushed the people of East Timor for 25 years, should not have any part in any policy drawn up by this State?</P>

      <P>I seem to be wasting my time trying to explain matters to Deputy Finucane. I visited a centre for people who were seeking to be integrated, by way of training, education, IT skills, child care skills and so on, into the Australian community. All these people were asylum seekers and had been accepted into the system. Nobody was detained anywhere. People were coming and going to the centres on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis, as would happen here in regard to FÁS training centres.</P>
      <P>The migrant resource centre incorporated the Australian Centre for Languages, one of Sydney's quality education and training organisations which is committed to facilitating cross-cultural international communications within communities and workplaces. In recent years, the adult migrant English programme has been the largest federally-funded English programme in the world for migrants and refugees. The programme provides language, literacy, numeracy, labour market and workforce training. It also provides a job network service which is designed to provide intensive assistance to people from non-English speaking backgrounds who are long-term unemployed. Services are provided for approximately 30 countries. The migrant resource centre provides child care and counselling services. Last year it was invited by the Australian department of immigration and multi-culturalism to plan the delivery of English and education services.</P>

      <P>To date I have granted light railway orders to CIE for the Tallaght to Abbey Street, Line A, and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green, Line B, lines. Preparatory work is continuing on these lines and both are on target for completion in 2002 and 2003 respectively.</P>
      <P>I have also approved CIE's proposal to extend Line A to Connolly Station in so far as it relates to the development from Abbey Street to Store Street. It is my intention to make the required light railway order for this section of the line when an acceptable proposal for a link between the Store Street stop and Connolly Station has been received. In addition, a geo-technical feasibility study of the city centre underground section has been completed and the technical feasibility of constructing it has been confirmed.</P>
      <P>The Government confirmed its commitment to Dublin light rail in a decision of 21 March when it approved a firm budget estimate of £185 million for the capital costs of the Tallaght to Abbey Street line and approved, in principle, the provision of £24 million for the extension of this line to Connolly Station. The Government also decided that a public private partnership approach should be adopted for the operation of the Tallaght to Connolly Station line. This will involve the award of an operating franchise to a private operator following a competitive tendering process.</P>
      <P>At its forthcoming meetings, the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development and PPP will discuss the issue of light rail in the wider context of the future public transport requirements in the Dublin area. Following these discussions, I will submit specific proposals to the Government.</P>

In May 1998, this was changed to an option costing more than £400 million. In his letter of resignation, Mr. Joyce said Luas will cost £1 billion. Now we hear that Luas will not be implemented by CIE but under the PPF. I then read that there are plans to axe Luas for a radical £4 billion metro line. Will the Minister clarify whether we will get phase one or two <Col N="77" /> of Luas or will it be privatised? Given that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, now says he is deeply uneasy about the Luas project, will we get a new metro line? There are also reports of an underground line from Ranelagh to Broadstone and a further line to Cabra, Mulhuddart and Blanchardstown. What line will we get?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 51 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 March I met UK Minister for Energy, Ms Helen Liddell, to call for the closure of Sellafield. While both Ms Liddell and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, have emphasised that current operations at the Sellafield plant were safe, I reiterated the Government's demand that the Sellafield reprocessing plant be closed immediately. I pointed out to Ms Liddell that in the light of the devastating criticism of Sellafield contained in the NII reports, the only satisfactory outcome for the Irish public would be closure of the plant. I also informed Ms Liddell of the Government's intention to re-examine the issue of litigation against Sellafield in the light of the NII reports. The Taoiseach has also raised Ireland's concerns about Sellafield with the Brit<Col N="79" /> ish Prime Minster on a number of occasions, most recently at last week's EU Summit in Lisbon.</P>
    <P>The impact of the NII reports on BNFL's major markets in Japan and Germany raise serious doubts about Sellafield's future. Recent announcements made about Swiss and Swedish dealings with BNFL have also shown the extent of the commercial damage to the company. In particular the falsification of records in regard to safety checks at the MOX demonstration plant has been a serious blow to the claimed economic viability of the proposed MOX fuel production plant and the existing THORP plant.</P>
    <P>As to the support of other Governments, I met the Danish Minister for Environment and Energy, Mr. Auken, on 27 March last to discuss what amounts to a joint attempt by Ireland and Denmark with, I hope, the support of the Nordic countries to seek the ending of reprocessing activities at Sellafield. Both the Irish Government and the Danish Government believe it is opportune to table a proposal of this nature. Accordingly, there are two draft decisions going forward for the Commission meeting in Copenhagen which will be hosted by Denmark. Tabling of these draft decisions underlines dramatically the view of both Governments that it is now time to call a halt to reprocessing. We believe that this is an outmoded and unduly hazardous activity. We also consider that its impact on our seas and sea-based livelihoods, such as fisheries, is totally unacceptable. We were therefore happy to share in a joint approach which will send out a very clear message that reprocessing should end and that unacceptable discharges into our seas should be stopped.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Mr. Auken, is exploring the possibility of a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen as part of the Commission meeting hosted by him. However, this requires further consultation with other Ministers. I will maintain close contact with my Nordic colleagues in the run-up to the OSPAR Commission meeting to ensure that the maximum pressure is put on the UK to end reprocessing operations at Sellafield. The Attorney General is currently examining the prospects for litigation against Sellafield following the publication of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate's report of 18 February last. The issue of litigation is complex and I await with interest the Attorney General's conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the progress to date. However, I note that Mr. Sven Auken seems to have taken the initiative. Does the Minister of State agree that British Nuclear Fuels are now on the run and they should be harassed at every opportunity, which will entail a pro-active role to be taken by him and the Government? The Minister of State should take the initiative and launch a legal, diplomatic and political offensive against Sellafield. When will the Minister of State, on foot of the Attorney General's report, launch a case against Sellafield <Col N="80" /> in the European courts? Does he agree the Government should launch a diplomatic offensive in every capital in Europe, particularly those whose Governments are customers of BNFL or whose countries are affected by emissions from Sellafield? Does he agree he should launch a political offensive by directly visiting supplying and affected European Governments and that he should arrange a special ministerial conference to gain support for the closure of Sellafield? Will the Minister of State press for bilateral talks solely on this issue between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister so we can make our case and emphasise that as long as Sellafield remains open, it will be a permanent bone of contention between our two countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's comments and support. Minister Auken has taken an initiative but he was gracious enough to comment at the recent press reception that Ireland was the one taking the initiative on this issue. I am not taking personal credit for this. The Taoiseach and I have said repeatedly, particularly in recent times, that successive Irish Governments have gone forward on this issue. The British authorities are under no illusions as to the feelings of successive Irish Governments and the Irish people. However, I agree with Deputy Stagg that we should press home our advantage at this time given that BNFL and the malaise it represents is under extreme pressure from all parts of the world, particularly from its main markets such as Japan, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and within its own shores. The time is now right for us to deal with this issue. We have already embarked upon the diplomatic approach for which the Deputy has called and I hope to meet with representatives of the other Nordic countries during the next couple of weeks with a view to repeating what we have already achieved with Denmark. My senior colleague has been extremely supportive in this regard, as has the entire Government. As far as the Taoiseach is concerned, I am pushing an open door in terms of his support on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I put down this question, progress has been made along the lines I suggested, particularly on the involvement of foreign countries. Does the Minister of State agree there is a high level of expectation that the campaign to have Sellafield closed down will be successful? Does he agree that discovery of the fabrication of quality control figures, the threat by the British nuclear installation chief inspector to close down the plant within two months, the suspension of MOX shipments to Japan, followed by Germany and Switzerland, the safety inquiry announced by the US Secretary for Energy because of fears for operations of the United States and, most recently, the involvement of the Nordic countries and the OSPAR meeting at the end of June were important? Does he agree that these events taking place so closely together gives us a reasonably <Col N="81" /> high expectation that our demands will be successful and that the Minister should use every means at his disposal to ensure this is the case?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider, as I suggested previously, harnessing opinion north of the Border, given that there have been acute concerns for a long time along the Down and Antrim coasts, often articulated by Eddie McGraddy M.P.? These concerns cross the political spectrum and what better way to symbolise common concern than concerted action on an issue which threatens the lives of men, women and children on this island? Will the Minister of State, in the spirit in which I make the suggestion, contact all the political parties north of the Border to have a co-ordinated approach on this vital issue?</P>

      <P>I agree with the list of aspects the Deputy mentioned, which are unacceptable. In addition, within 24 hours of publication of the reports, I instructed senior personnel of the RPII to meet representatives of the NII in the UK to discuss the reports. They reported back to me that night on what had taken place at the meeting. One of the appalling aspects was that not only had there been severe management shortcomings from corporate management right down through the whole management structure and severe lapses in safety management, but by their own revelations these shortcomings had obtained since the early 1990s under the noses of their own inspectorate. This is of great concern to me and it makes it very difficult for any of us, particularly the Irish people, to have confidence in any reassurances that may be forthcoming. We will use the OSPAR meeting in June as the vehicle to progress this issue. Our motion uses terminology such as &ldquo;terminate&rdquo; and &ldquo;cessation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;, which is included in the Danish motion, which is of a similar spirit to our motion. &ldquo;Suspension&rdquo; has a temporary literal meaning. I would like to include our colleagues north of the Border. I am addressing a meeting on the subject in a few weeks' time when I intend to meet certain people in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to alter my approach to day to day management issues in CIE. As I made clear to this House on 7 March, I do not interfere in the day to day running of the company. However, I have a responsibility to ensure that the company pursues policies which are in the broad national interest and that the considerable public funding provided for the company is used effectively.</P>
      <P>In my reply to questions on 15 February last, I confirmed that it was time for a fundamental rethink about how we deliver public transport services. In the course of my reply I indicated that this included examining the existing institutional arrangements and the relationship between CIE and its subsidiary companies. I subsequently indicated a personal preference for the establishment of the three CIE subsidiaries as independent companies.</P>
      <P>This is a time of immense change in public transport. National economic development is in part dependent on the efficient and effective delivery of public transport services. The need to do this is all the more pressing, given the billions of pounds that will be invested in public transport over the coming few years. I am determined to ensure that significantly improved services are provided. I have asked officials in my Department to consider the issue and to identify and evaluate the options for institutional reform.</P>

      <P>I am bamboozled with the number of leaks, comments and press reports regarding the Minister's future intentions for CIE. Will she clarify whether it is her intention, as reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, to split CIE into three separate companies? Will this involve three separate chief executives, boards, chairpersons and so on and does she intend to appoint them? Where will that leave integrated ticketing? Has the Minister or her Department been involved in talks with either Stage Coach or First Bus in relation to the sale or purchase of Dublin Bus or any part of Bus Éireann or is it intended to introduce them into Ireland in any form? Does she agree that these daily conflicting rumours, leaks and so on are creating a climate of uncertainty and are demoralising CIE from top to bottom and that there is a clear-cut need for a comprehensive singular Government statement as to the future of that organisation?</P>

I have no responsibility or inclination to try to pin down who led with that amazing story except to tell everybody that I never met them, never heard from them, did not intend to hear from them and neither did the Department. Why would I allow a story to go out that I met someone when I did not? That would be ridiculous. I have no intention of meeting them. Clearly there was an attempt by somebody &ndash; I wonder who it was &ndash; to initiate a programme of selective type leaks. That was the week I met the unions and I gave them all that answer. The Deputy asked if I intend to split CIE into three separate companies. It is already split into three separate companies but I intend to put forward to the Cabinet infrastructural committee a proposal for three separate boards. Integrated ticketing has not begun, although the money has been provided for it. It will be possible to have integrated ticketing among the three companies.</P>

Is there not a point at which one has to move from thinking to doing and decisions have to be made? Does the Minister disagree with her Government colleagues who say the company should be privatised? In view of the latest figures available from the Dublin transportation office that our public transport needs are four and a half times greater <Col N="85" /> than anything in the pipeline it would be folly to dispose of any aspect of our transport related infrastructure simply because we need the funding.

      <P>There have been no decisions taken by the EU specifically in relation to the postal service since the adoption over three years ago of Directive 97/67/EC on Common Rules for the Development of the Internal Market of Community Postal Services and the Improvement of Quality of Service.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy has in mind the subject matter of a recent press report regarding a proposal by the European Commission to request member states to supply details of the accounts of their national postal operators in order that it may evaluate the extent of cross-subsidisation, if any, between the monopoly and competitive areas of their activities. The press report in question, which I have seen, also refers to the possibility of VAT being applied to the competitive part of the postal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Commission expects to submit a proposal for a further directive on the deregu<Col N="86" /> lation of the market in postal services for consideration by the member states later this year.

The rural post office network, which the previous Government and this Government have endeavoured to sustain, would be in a precarious position if the newspaper indications came to pass.

      <P>The Government is totally committed to the rural post office network. The proposed directive which was the subject of the newspaper article has not yet come to us in any form. In the newspaper yesterday I read that An Post is finding it difficult to fill vacancies.

Does she agree that when 113 sub-post offices account for only 9% of An Post's business, the position is highly precarious? Regardless of whether a new regulation comes into effect, this group of post offices is doomed if the Government does not take steps to provide income for them.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's premise as he outlines it. However, the process by which the contract for a service is allocated is more and more subject to EU scrutiny. The EU is looking at these matters and I think that is the background to the newspaper article to which we have been referring. An Post has put forward £5 million from the sale of An Post On Line and the Government is committed to contributing towards that to enable the post office network to achieve new technology. More and more, the allocation of extra services must be the subject of competition. That is the way things are going.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State press the Taoiseach to seek a special bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister to emphasise that the <Col N="91" /> Sellafield nuclear plant will be a permanent bone of contention between the two Governments as long as it remains open? Will the Minister of State take into consideration the effect of closure of the Sellafield nuclear plant on workers in Cumbria and offer the Government's support for measures to be taken by the European Union to ease the effect of job losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has raised this matter on a number of occasions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. He also met the Danish Minister for the Environment and Energy earlier this week immediately following his meeting with me. Every Member of this House can emphathise with the people of Cumbria who are concerned about job losses. As Deputy Yates is aware, thousands of jobs were lost within a very short period in the fertiliser and pottery industries in south Wicklow and north Wexford. We are aware, therefore, of the hardship job losses can cause. While I agree that we should be as helpful as we possibly can at EU level, the safety and well being of our seas and the nations and peoples which could be affected by their contamination cannot be subservient to the jobs of any group of workers or nation. The experience and expertise gained by the people concerned in the nuclear industry could be availed of in clean-up operations in the United Kingdom and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the Minister of State's sentiments that the safety of our people and that of our neighbours in a country which has also long been used to unemployment is paramount, we should be prepared to do anything we could to help those who may find themselves unemployed in Cumbria. Does the Minister of State recall the paper presented at a meeting of the committee of which I am a member by Dr. Thompson, entitled The Grand Bargain, in which he suggests that the expertise of the people concerned could be brought to bear in clean-up operations in nuclear installations throughout Europe and Russia in particular? This aspect should be given serious consideration to provide employment for those who may lose their jobs in Cumbria, which must be secondary to the safety of our people, the food they eat and the air they breathe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the health and safety of our people must take priority; all other considerations are secondary. Professor Gordon Thompson's theory presented in the paper, The Grand Bargain, is an interesting one and makes much sense. He has made presentations to us from time to time and I have read his papers. The expertise gained could be availed of in clean-up operations in some of the less sophisticated plants in eastern Europe which may in time, like Chernobyl, have devastating effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State seems to be <Col N="92" /> less than enthusiastic about my suggestion of a special well flagged bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. I understand the reasons for this. If there is an opportunity to score a goal there is no point in passing the ball to somebody else. However, I am sure the Minister of State will actively deny this. Will he look at the possibility of organising and chairing a special conference to be attended by Ministers of the countries supplying and affected by the Sellafield nuclear plant? This would have the effect of increasing pressure on the British Government and on British Nuclear Fuels. The British Minister should be included in the conference with a view to forcing the early ending of reprocessing, the current worthy target.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to lose sight of the other dangers there, particularly the highly radioactive liquid waste which is stored there. We know they told lies about the other issues and they might be telling us lies about the safety of that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Mindful of Deputy Stagg's experience in this portfolio and the work he has put into it, I would not be unenthusiastic about anything he proposes. The suggestion of a special conference may well be a good one and we will give that positive consideration.</P>
      <P>Of course we will continue to press home our serious concerns about many other things, including the storage of high level waste. The Deputy kept pressing that matter when he was Minister of State and I have been pressing it since I came into office. That high level waste is highly dangerous. It is a highly volatile material. The speed at which it is being handled and dealt with through the vitrification process is not in keeping with our demands. Clearing the problem by 2015 is not soon enough.</P>
      <P>That and other concerns are underlined by the Government's policy. While we are dealing with the OSPAR Convention as the vehicle to deal with discharges at present, the Government's overall call is for the total cessation of activities at Sellafield. This is just one aspect of it which we are pursuing now. We will endeavour to keep on this particular road at this time.</P>

As stated in the reply to a question from Deputy Yates today or yesterday on the stage of the tenders which had been reached, the Sandyford line is approved. The next matter will be the funding for that.</P>
      <P>In the next month or two, I intend to find out what system is in use in all the other cities &ndash; I will not visit them because I will not have the time. The Government is determined that there will be a much more comprehensive underground system, embracing all the city and involving many spurs from it. Clearly it is needed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the current. Has there been any assessment of what the subsidy will be?</P>
      <P>Second, if one looks at the Ove Arup report undertaken by CIE and the DTO plan, that is, what is called the Metro-style £4 billion plan, there are clearly elements which contradict the Luas proposal. If one leaves aside the Tallaght line and the Sandyford line, it is a case of choosing one or the other. One does not choose a system with overground and underground elements. Therefore, will the Minister confirm that an adoption by the Government on the 11th or 18th of the bigger, £4 billion Metro-style plan will mean alterations to the previous Luas plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That may not necessarily arise. Certainly the Luas line from Tallaght to Dublin and Dublin to Connolly Station will be an on street system. The capital has been approved. The ancillary services are contracted and working. Next month it goes out to combined tender.</P>
      <P>When we get the presentation on either the 11th or the 18th, we will then be in a position to know exactly the size and nature of, and be able to take decisions on, the comprehensive underground system which clearly the city needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the debate has moved from statements that we should not have an underground to a realisation and acceptance, if only a partial acceptance, that Dublin would be about <Col N="94" /> the only large metropolitan city which does not have an underground public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me about the subsidy. A year ago the Government decided that this would be a public/private partnership construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>The principles underlying the conferences are that the child's interests are paramount and that in so far as is possible the child is best looked after within his or her own family. This is in line with the principles underlying the Child Care Act, 1991. One of the issues explored by an Irish delegation on a visit to New Zealand a little over a year ago was the applicability of this concept to the Irish context. To this end a pilot project has already been established in the Eastern Health Board area with a view to extending the system nationally.</P>
      <P>Part III amends the Child Care Act, 1991, and imposes a duty on health boards to seek a special care order or an interim special care order in relation to a child in its area who requires special care and protection which he or she is not likely to receive unless the court makes such an order. This provides an additional range of powers for boards to intervene to ensure that non-offending children with behavioural problems receive proper care, protection and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court has held that the 1991 Act does not empower a health board to detain a child. It also held that the State is under a constitutional duty to provide suitable secure accommodation for children who need to be detained for their safety and welfare. There are a small number of children who require this type of secure accommodation as their behavioural difficulties are such that they cannot be catered for in <Col N="96" /> the general residential care system. Under this Part of the Bill the boards will have responsibility for ensuring the provision and operation of appropriate services and facilities for children who need to be detained in their own interests and the Bill will give health boards the power to detain such children on receipt of a court order.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Bill is drafted in such a way as to make clear that a child would, except in emergencies, only be detained in such a unit as a last resort. Under the proposals in the Bill a health board would have to convene a family welfare conference in relation to any child in respect of whom it intended to make an application for a special care order. The Bill also provides that boards can provide alternative arrangements or other accommodation for the child who is the subject of such an order as part of the programme for the care, education and treatment of the child. This is fully in line with the philosophy underpinning our child care services which emphasises the need to provide a continuum of services for such children from family support services to special fostering arrangements to residential care.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to tackling the problems of children in need of special care and protection is demonstrated by the launch of the Springboard initiative. Under this initiative 15 pilot projects have been set up across the country. The objective of the pilot projects is to prevent at risk children and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a proactive, inter-agency response to support these young people and their families. There are two key elements to this approach. The first element is the establishment of formal collaborative structures involving relevant State agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community. The second key element is the identification or establishment of a local centre which will act as a focal point for the delivery of services to young people and children. The centres will be a resource for parents and children. I believe these projects will provide a model for helping families with multiple problems and the wider communities living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Another major innovation in the Bill is the establishment of the special residential services board. The board is designed to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services for children placed in special care units under Part III of the Bill or placed in detention schools under Part X. Non-offending children with behavioural difficulties who are the subject of special care orders and child offenders will be kept in separate residential accommodation. However, it is acknowledged that they regularly present with similar problems, require similar care and treatment and benefit from similar types of services.</P>
    <P>The board will have a wide remit in relation to the co-ordination of such services, ensuring the appropriate use of them, liaising with the courts in relation to the level and nature of these ser<Col N="97" /> vices and advising the Minister in relation to any adjustments in the provision of accommodation or services for young offenders or children with behavioural difficulties. The board will also have a function in research and evaluation relating to the detention of children. I am convinced that this board will enable the services to be delivered in a more co-ordinated manner. Indicative of the Government's commitment to the board and its confidence in the important role envisaged for it, the board is at present being established on an interim administrative basis pending the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part X establishes children detention schools which will be under the aegis of the Minister for Education and Science. These schools will provide for the detention of children aged between 12 and 16 years who have been found guilty of offences and in respect of whom no option other than detention is deemed appropriate. It emphasises the role of schools in promoting the reintegration of the children referred to them back into society. This will be done through the provision of appropriate educational and training programmes and appropriate facilities in which to deliver these programmes. While the Bill is founded on the principle that the imposition of a custodial sentence should be a matter of last resort, it recognises the reality that there will continue to be a need for custodial centres to accommodate the most serious cases.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is embarking on a major development programme to enable it meet its obligations under the Bill and also to address deficiencies and weaknesses in existing facilities. These plans, when completed, will fully equip the children detention schools to meet their obligations under the Bill, including the obligation to provide for the most difficult, unruly or depraved children who heretofore would have been transferred to the adult prison system and also those children convicted of offences who have serious therapeutic needs.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part XII of the Bill updates the child protection provisions of the 1908 Act, thus allowing that Act to be totally repealed. An important addition to this Part arises from my acceptance of a recommendation of the then Select Committee on Social Affairs in their 1997 report on non-fatal offences against the person in respect of children. The effect of the change is that the meaning of a child's well being in the section on cruelty is expanded to include mental and emotional well being, and the expression &ldquo;ill-treat&rdquo; will include frightening, bullying of threatening a child. The legislation will now give out a clear message that cruelty can mean more than physical cruelty or neglect.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this is a balanced and fully comprehensive Bill. It balances the needs, rights and interests of the child offender, the vulnerable child, families and communities, the victim and society in general. Also, from the start of the preparation of the Bill and its predecessor there has been a high level of co-operation between <Col N="98" /> officials from the three Departments concerned. The results of that co-operation are clearly seen throughout the Bill. That co-operation is continuing as preparation is made for the full implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I started out this speech by emphasising the historic nature of the Bill. It provides a new way for dealing with juvenile offending without, at the same time, discarding procedures and policies that have been seen to work. There is something in it for all young offenders, regardless of age, needs or type of offence committed. It will also have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable children and their families and will further develop the legislative framework for the development of services for these children and their families enabling them to break out of the cycle of disadvantage and become fully included with the rest of society.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is disappointing that it is three years since the Children Bill, 1996, which is similar to the Bill now before the House, was published. The 1996 Bill was brought before the House by Deputy Currie, then Minister of State with responsibility for children, on behalf of the Rainbow coalition on 12 February 1997. That Bill was originally published on 28 November 1996. The delay of three years is inexcusable.</P>
      <P>The Minister made various commitments to introduce the Bill over the past three years but in effect has shown total disinterest. He has always stated, as he did again this morning, that the Bill was being totally revamped, but the Bill now before the House is almost identical to that introduced by Deputy Currie in 1997, apart from some amendments. The Minister informed me in answer to a parliamentary question that the total number of changes in the Bill is 15. This is a minimal number of amendments in terms of impact given that the original Bill had 230 sections. The Minister has changed some of the original Bill and, while not changing the content, has increased the number of sections. The Bill before the House now has 272 sections.</P>
      <P>The Minister's problem is that the severe attack made on Deputy Currie's Bill on Second Stage in 1997 is returning to haunt him and he is anxious to distance himself as far as possible from those comments. The Minister was extremely critical in his comments on Deputy Currie's Bill. He was extremely critical that the then Government was &ldquo;plagiarising and hijacking Fianna Fáil proposed legislation&rdquo;. He said &ldquo;this kind of legislative hijacking undermines parliamentary democracy&rdquo;. I do not subscribe to those comments but I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the legislation previously introduced by a Fine Gael Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the Minister's approach when in Opposition he stated that members of that Government were involved in this surreptitious game and would do well to remember that <Col N="99" /> while they can &ldquo;plagiarise our work, steal our ideas and engage in bare faced lies, nobody was fooled by the shallow depth of their innovations and ambitions. Everybody knows that they are legislative parasites&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for doing what he suggested we should be criticised for in 1997. How does the Minister feel about introducing a Bill, which is almost identical to the one introduced by Deputy Currie when he was Minister of State with responsibility for children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's view that the 1997 Bill must be read with a growing sense of disappointment and merely tinkers at the systems and solutions which have already been seen to be inadequate and that it &ldquo;lacks innovation and vision and merely offers more of the same&rdquo;. I do not accept the Minister's description of the 1997 legislation as &ldquo;window dressing&rdquo;. It is not correct to say that the Bill is shuffling and rewriting common law in statutory form and existing schemes have been transcribed. I further do not accept that the approach taken in the Bill was a shallow attempt at parliamentary scrabble to create the illusion of activity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions for early intervention in juvenile justice in the legislation at an inter-agency level for children at risk by the holding of a family welfare conference. While this can be triggered by the direction from the court when a criminal charge is involved, it is important that health boards can also trigger the establishment of the conference when it appears, in its opinion, that a child may require special protection. I ask the Minister to outline in detail how this will operate in practice. What criteria will be laid down for health board officials to enable them to activate such a conference? At what level within the health board will it be activated? What are the cost implications for the health boards of this new role? What provision has the Minister made to ensure that there is adequate resources to enable the boards to meet their new responsibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the introduction of the family welfare conference relates to the Child Care Act, 1991, and is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children, it is more appropriate to debate this separately to the juvenile justice area. Part III deals with children in need of special care and protection and it includes an amendment to the Child Care Act, 1991. It legislates for the granting of special care orders by the courts where &ldquo;the <Col N="100" /> behaviour of the child is such that it poses a real and substantial risk to his or her health, safety, development or welfare, and the child requires special care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the court makes such an order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are concerns in relation to the granting of such an order as consideration will be given to the behaviour of the child and the availability of services. In the current absence of a continuum of child care and family support services, there exists a real fear that children's behaviour may be defined in terms which allow for the granting of such an order in order to access the services needed. I am also concerned about the nature of the orders which are to be granted for six to 12 months. Children who are the subject of such orders are not party to proceedings and have no automatic right to legal representation. It will be important to monitor the circumstances in which the orders are granted and to ensure consistency among judges in this matter. Will the Minister outline his plans in this regard? It is of concern that the Bill does not state how often such units are to be inspected or allow for the establishment of an independent body to monitor them. It is essential that children subject to civil detention benefit from the care, education and treatment provided for them in the units and have their rights upheld. Children who have been found guilty of an offence cannot be placed in such units.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the diversion programme, which places the Garda juvenile liaison scheme on a statutory footing and renames it. The objective of the programme is &ldquo;to divert from committing further offences any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour&rdquo;. Diversion may be by way of administering a caution, formal or informal, to the child and, if appropriate, by placing the child under the supervision of a juvenile liaison officer and convening a conference to be attended by the child, family members and other concerned persons, including the victim.</P>
    <P>A function of the conference is that children must admit responsibility for their acts before admittance to the scheme. If the director refuses the child admission, what happens? JLOs will have quite an amount of discretionary power in deciding whether to request a conference in respect of a child. Will conferences be convened only when it is perceived that they are likely to succeed? There is a need for acknowledgement of the time necessary to prepare for such conferences. One of the key elements of success is an independent co-ordinator. This consideration needs be built into the organisation of the programme to increase the likelihood of successful conference outcomes. The Bill does not take this consideration on board and states that a garda must convene the conference.</P>
    <P>Is a juvenile liaison officer the best person to convene and possibly chair a conference? A person perceived as neutral may be more appropri<Col N="101" /> ate. JLOs will also need further training if they are to take on these additional roles. The committee to monitor the effectiveness of the programmes is to be made up of members of the Garda and is to submit annual reports. It is essential that the programme should be independently evaluated. Will the Minister accept such an evaluation?</P>
    <P>The family conference allows the child's problem to be aired and a programme of corrective measures to be suggested in the presence of the child, his or her parents, perhaps others interested in the child's welfare and, in some cases, the victim. It is essential that this type of intervention takes place soon after a child commits an offence because if he or she becomes a persistent offender, successful intervention will become more problematic. The legislation ensures the earliest intervention by placing the family conference within the diversion programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play of the alteration in Part V in regard to criminal responsibility. He has raised the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years. Effectively there is no difference between Deputy Currie's 1996 Bill and the current legislation in this area. In the previous Bill the age of responsibility was increased to ten years but it also included a provision whereby if the Ministers of Health and Education agreed to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 11 or 12 years, it could be prescribed. It was not necessary to revert to legislative procedures to increase the age of responsibility to 12 under the previous legislation.</P>
    <P>Part VI introduces some changes and additions to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the treatment of persons in custody under the Garda Regulations 1997, as they apply to children, on a fully statutory basis in the comprehensive set of provisions. It is underpinned by a statement of principle that children who are being investigated for the commission of an offence are entitled to special treatment in accordance with this provision. It recognises the vulnerability of children because of their age and their level of maturity.</P>
    <P>In what is a regressive step in comparison to the 1996 Bill, the 1999 Bill now excludes another adult reasonably named by the child from being present at the child's interview in a Garda station in favour of an adult, excluding a garda, nominated by a member of the Garda. It is wrong and regressive that this change has been made on the previous Bill's proposal. Will the Minister consider giving the discretion to the child in selecting the adult to be present at the child's interview in the Garda station?</P>
    <P>Provisions have also been made for interviewing children without the presence of a parent or guardian. This should be closely examined by the Minister. It is important that the parents or guardian of a child are notified by the Garda Síochána of their child's arrest and the nature of the offence on which the child was arrested. They should be requested to attend the Garda station as soon as possible. Failure to attend, however, <Col N="102" /> should not be a sanction. It would be unreasonable in certain circumstances to expect parents to be always in a position to react quickly to notification of a child's arrest, and it would be further unfair to expect the Garda to wait indefinitely for the parents' arrival.</P>
    <P>The child should be in a position to ask for an adult relative to be present if the parents are unavailable. I also welcome the fact that if the member in charge of the Garda station to which the arrested child has been brought believes the child is in need of care or protection, the garda will be obliged to inform the local health board. He or she does not have discretion in that regard. He or she will be obliged to inform the local health board and a representative of the board will then go to the station as soon as possible. This is very important in areas where a child is homeless or is engaged in prostitution.</P>
    <P>Part VII establishes a new children's court which will replace the existing Juvenile Court. It will be the District Court when dealing with all summary cases involving children, including the jurisdiction given to the District Court under the Child Care Act, 1991. Under the Bill, the President of the District Court will have the power to designate children to court judges in any district to which more than one judge is attached. For other districts, a panel of judges will be established by the president from which he or she may designate children's court judges. It is for the president of the court to decide on which basis he or she will make these designations.</P>
    <P>Part VIII underpins by general statement, principles establishing the rights of children before the proposed Children's Court. There are several important crossovers in the Bill from the justice to the care and protection procedures for dealing with children. One of these is provided for in section 78 which allows the court to adjourn proceedings against the child when it appears that the child is in need of care or protection. The health board will then investigate the child's circumstances and, having done so, will inform the court of its assessment of his or her health care needs.</P>
    <P>Part IX outlines the powers of the courts in relation to child offenders. A child can be detained where it is the only suitable penalty. In these circumstances, it behoves us to provide the courts with a wide range of community sanctions which, if used imaginatively, should ensure an appropriate sanction for each child on whom such a sanction is imposed.</P>
    <P>Part IX sets out clearly and concisely the powers of a court on a finding of guilt of a child. On a finding of guilt, before a court decides how it will deal with the child, it can request a report on the child. It is entitled to this in any case but is obliged to have one whenever it forms an opinion that the appropriate penalty may be a community sanction on detention.</P>
    <P>Section 115 introduces community based sanctions which greatly increase the non-custodial options available to the court. They will place <Col N="103" /> new and increased demands on the Probation and Welfare Service. If the sanctions are to function effectively and be available as options to all children countrywide, there will need to be adequate resourcing of the services and personnel necessary to establish the options outlined. The biggest single obstacle currently faced by judges in the children's court is the dearth of suitable alternative community based projects to which the children can be referred. The Probation and Welfare Service in particular will require a substantial increase in resources. Also, evaluation of the proposed sanctions is essential to ascertain the sanctions that are most effective for whom and the reason they are the most effective.</P>
    <P>The sanctions will also place increased demands on parents. The courts may order parents to pay compensation, exercise control over their child or make a parental supervision order. This order gives the court power to instruct parents to undergo treatment for alcohol or drug abuse and/or to attend a parenting course where facilities are reasonably available.</P>
    <P>The role of the courts in promoting good parenting practices needs to be examined and questions raised as to whether resources will be made available to parents to allow them to comply with the order. I am talking about crèche facilities and the availability of parenting courses to allow parents to do these courses. A battery of services should be available to facilitate parents in ensuring that they can comply with the new arrangements the courts may impose on them, which are welcome, but they must be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Part X sees the end of the reform and industrial schools &ndash; not before time &ndash; and replacement with children's detention schools. These will be used by the courts where detention is considered to be the only suitable way of dealing with the child. Imprisonment of children is to be prohibited. That raises two issues of concern and I ask the Minister to address them. First, directors of such schools cannot refuse to admit children from the courts. This may lead to the inappropriate mixing of children with differing needs and may also lead to overcrowding. Also, a revolving door may be created whereby children are released from the schools before completion of their programme to make way for those coming from the courts. This is clearly not in the interest of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>A second concern which I ask the Minister to address is that the Bill directs that regular inspections are to be carried out, with no specification as to their regularity. The 1996 Rainbow Government's Bill stated that inspections be carried out &ldquo;at least once every six months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The third concern is that the Bill provided an opportunity to phase out St. Patrick's Detention Centre, which has been regularly condemned as totally inadequate for young people. However, the distinction made in the Bill between the children's detention schools and centres of detention has been made precisely to retain St. Patrick's as <Col N="104" /> a lawful place of detention for juveniles. Both in structure and in daily routine, St. Patrick's is identical to Mountjoy Prison. This flies in the face of the main thrust and principle of the Bill, which is that imprisonment of juveniles is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Section 158 outlines the principal object of the children's detention centres. This is of the utmost importance. Under the Bill, an inspector, appointed by the Minister for Education and Science, will be responsible for the inspection of each school. Children's Court judges will be entitled to visit schools at any time. A sophisticated policy of leave and supervision will ensure that children successfully integrate back into society. Voluntary after care will be available on completion of detention.</P>
    <P>Part XII of the Bill reintroduces some of the provisions of the 1908 Act for the protection of children. I welcome the fact that the provisions on cruelty and neglect are being updated and the penalty increased substantially. Changes in the law are also being introduced regarding the sending out of children to beg. The evidential burden will now be on the person who sent the child out to beg, making successful prosecutions easier. The law on encouraging or causing a sexual offence upon a child under 17 years of age is being updated in many important respects, including increased penalties.</P>
    <P>The Bill is providing a legislative framework to introduce a new juvenile justice system over the coming years. The success or failure of this Bill will depend on the resources provided by the Government to operate its full potential. The Bill will be of no value unless the resources are made available to fully implement it and ensure that its full capacity to reform the juvenile justice system is realised, within the parameters and priorities established and employed in the Bill. It will also require dedication and expertise on the part of those who will be charged with operating it. The financing of supports for children in difficulty is a disgrace. We do not have treatment centres for children in extreme difficulties or children out of control. In this context, I have no confidence that the Government will provide the resources required for the successful implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must examine how we treat children in difficulties. The appalling situation outlined in the High Court by Mr. Justice Kelly and others over the past few years, particularly over the past 12 months, should not be tolerated in any society. Why should a girl of 17 years be detained in the central mental institution, a hospital for the criminally insane, despite expert opinion that it was totally inappropriate and possibly illegal? The judge had no option because of, as he said, &ldquo;the State's failure to provide appropriate facilities or even a legislative framework to deal with such cases&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Five years ago, Mr. Justice Geoghegan, in the context of dealing with a teenage girl, said the State had a constitutional obligation to provide &ldquo;as soon as reasonably practicable, suitable <Col N="105" /> arrangements of containment and treatment&rdquo; for troubled children. One month ago, Mr. Justice Kelly stated, &ldquo;the State authorities could have been in no doubt of their obligations in that regard&rdquo;. He further stated, &ldquo;it was clear that on no occasion has there been an adherence to the timescale indicated&rdquo;. In each case the provision of facilities has been deferred further and further.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the case unfolded of a 15 year old girl who went out of control following the death of her mother. After coming under the influence of truly evil people, she was said to have had some 75 sexual partners while working as a prostitute, used her mobile phone as a sex chatline, smoked 40 to 60 cigarettes a day and took alcohol and drugs. In spite of her circumstances, she wound up in a State remand centre because there was nowhere better available.</P>
    <P>Last week, an extremely disturbed 14 year old girl with a propensity to epilepsy was ordered to be detained in the acute psychiatric unit of a general hospital. She almost died after an overdose of alcohol and 20 ecstasy tablets, was allegedly raped after staying out late from a health board residential home and was diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. The expert said that she needed immediately a secure residential environment where she could receive appropriate therapy and treatment from suitably qualified staff. However, the child's life was in imminent danger, there was no suitable alternative and Mr. Justice Kelly spoke again of the &ldquo;appalling dilemma &ldquo; in which he was being placed. He said the State's failure &ldquo;manifests itself, week in week out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Four days before Christmas, another 14 year old, described by a psychiatrist as &ldquo;the saddest thing I have ever met&rdquo;, who had an alcoholic mother and a violent father who allegedly sexually abused her, and who had tried to kill herself on Christmas Day 1998, was sent to a State detention centre by the High Court. Thus, an innocent child who, in the words of Mr. Justice Kelly, &ldquo;never had a chance&rdquo; spent her fourteenth Christmas in a reformatory.</P>
    <P>Shortly before that, a 16 year old boy, with psychiatric and psychological difficulties but with no criminal convictions, was ordered to be returned to St. Patrick's institution, a prison, despite the presiding judge's view that his continued detention there was unlawful and the boy's allegation that he had been raped there. This would come as no surprise to anyone. In 1997 a 13 year old was warned by Judge Mary Martin that if she sent him there he would be &ldquo;locked up 23 hours a day and raped every night&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kelly concluded in a 1999 judgment that:</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to characterise what has gone on as a scandal. I have had evidence of interdepartmental wrangles over demarcation lines going on for months, seemingly endless delays in drafting and redrafting legislation, policy that appears to be made only to be reversed and a waste of public resources on, <Col N="106" /> for example, going through an entire planning process for the Portrane development, only for the Minister to change his mind, thereby necessitating the whole process being gone through again.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for the Minister and the Government to revamp totally our approach to juvenile justice and how the justice system responds to children who are in difficulties. We must facilitate them to stop, examine their situation and ensure the resources of the State are available to help stop them leading a life of crime, with the consequent hurt to their victims, families and themselves. In a way, it is a new beginning and full advantage must be taken off it. However, I stress the need to provide resources. While the Bill is doing a good job, it is useless without the necessary, quite considerable resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Any objective assessment of children's policy since the foundation of the State will reveal a litany of failures &ndash; failure to invest resources, to provide a comprehensive legislative framework for children's policy and to give children the political priority they need and deserve. The fact that this Bill is intended to replace the existing Children Act, 1908, and associated legislation is testimony to this state of affairs. The fact that the Bill makes reference to 41 other items of legislation lays bare the disjointed, chaotic legislative mess which child policy in Ireland has struggled to cope with since the early years of this century.</P>
      <P>A new start, underpinned by comprehensive legislation has been needed for some time. The previous Government recognised this fact and a considerable amount of time and resources were invested in preparing groundbreaking legislation to cover children's issues. The Children Bill was introduced into this House in 1996 and Second Stage was debated on 12 February 1997, three years ago. However, the progress of that Bill through Committee Stage was halted when the current Government came to office.</P>
      <P>It has taken the Government three years to come up with a comprehensive piece of child legislation. This Bill does not differ radically from the 1996 Bill. In those three wasted years, hundreds of children have fallen into the vicious cycle of crime and poverty. They have been the victims of the prevarication, confusion and denial that has characterised Government policy on this issue. Until recently, the Government let the Children Bill, 1996, gather dust in committee, while it tried to figure out whether it would amend that Bill or produce a new one. These are the actions of a Government which had no policy, direction or determination to tackle this issue when it took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again it was revealed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, the man who had all the answers when he pontificated from these benches in Opposition, did not have the first notion what action to take <Col N="107" /> when he took over responsibility at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Government has given itself the luxury of a three year think-in to formulate a position. No such luxury exists for families with troubled children or for children at risk and for the many communities under siege from juvenile crime problems.</P>
    <P>Irish society is not meeting the needs of many children. Government failure to do so is clearly manifesting itself in the kinds of problems which come to politicians' attention in their constituencies. In recent years, public meetings, which we all attend on a regular basis, have been dominated by problems associated with young people such as drug and alcohol abuse, the proliferation of gangs who engage in threatening and intimidating behaviour, a huge increase in joyriding and the increasing numbers of children who seem to be parentless, who run amok and cause havoc in their community.</P>
    <P>At Government level, it seems children barely rate. Responsibility for their welfare is spread over so many Departments that the buck is frequently passed and their rights are disregarded. It appears that the Irish child care system has an underlying culture which believes that if a problem is really serious, it belongs on someone else's desk. The tragedy is all the greater because problems relating to children are not insoluble. The funding is available, but recognition of their needs and most importantly the political will to meet those needs is required.</P>
    <P>Three principles should underlie the approach to juvenile justice. Given his record to date, it is difficult to have confidence in the Minister's ability to uphold those principles. The first of these is the principle of prevention. Juvenile offenders should be regarded as the crucial group in any strategy of prevention of crime. The Minister's lack of urgency in producing this Bill indicates that he has yet to accept this point. The second principle is that rehabilitation must be central to the criminal justice system. Again the Minister has not grasped this point. How else can he explain the massive underprovision of drug treatment services in the prisons, where the majority of prisoners have drug problems, or the scandalously low number of treatment places for sex offenders in prison? The Minister's record on both of these issues concerning rehabilitation has been abysmal. More than anything else the juvenile justice services must aim to rehabilitate young offenders and break the seemingly inevitable link between today's young offender and tomorrow's adult criminal. The third principle is a political commitment to secure adequate resources to cater for the most troubled children in our society. On all three of these principles the Government has failed miserably.</P>
    <P>It is deeply regrettable that we are only now beginning a debate on a comprehensive Children Bill, nearly three years after the Government took office. However, I broadly welcome the Bill which the Minister has brought before the House <Col N="108" /> today. At last it gives this House an opportunity to have a substantial debate on child welfare and juvenile justice, a debate that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity and length of this Bill, there are a large number of changes and amendments which the Labour Party will be seeking and which we can all address on Committee Stage. However, before I turn to the detail of the Bill I will comment on the context in which it is being debated. There is no doubt that currently there is a crisis in child welfare services. The long history of antiquated legislation and chronic underfunding has resulted in child services that are struggling to cope, a system run on crisis management. The resources and staffing have never been provided for the development of high quality preventative services. Social services, operated under the auspices of the health boards, have been the Cinderella of Irish social policy in terms of investment and funding. This litany of neglect is felt by hundreds of families and communities countrywide. While the passing of legislation to establish a coherent legislative framework within which to address these issues is welcome, it is only part of the solution.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is not backed by significant increases in staff and funding, it will have no real benefit for children, families and communities depending on it. Without the financial resources to make a real difference, this Bill will remain little more than an aspirational wish list, to be implemented when resources become available, as the authors of many parliamentary replies are so fond of telling Members in this House.</P>
    <P>The current lack of staff and facilities dedicated to children is appalling. According to recent parliamentary questions, the Minister's best current estimate is that a further 63 staff will be required in the probation and welfare service alone to ensure the full implementation of the Children Bill. An indication of the lengthy timeframe the Minister envisages for the implementation of this legislation was revealed when the Minister stated that recruitment will be intensified over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Why should we have confidence in the Minister's ability to secure this level of staff? In May last year the probation and welfare service had to strike to get the Government to agree to provide the staff which the Government review had said were required. Before this Bill is considered, 90 additional probation and welfare staff are required. The Government approved 46 posts last year and only one has been filled to date. This is a disgrace. An additional 91 staff are needed plus a further 63 to implement fully the provisions of this Bill. There is no indication that the Minister has taken steps to ensure that those staff are available when it comes to recruitment.</P>
    <P>A huge number of social workers are needed to ensure that the current waiting lists are adequately met, let alone to accomplish the additional tasks delegated to health boards under this Bill. On the Order of Business last year the Taoiseach referred to the hundreds of children in <Col N="109" /> the Eastern Health Board area alone who are on a waiting list to be seen by social workers. In the interim period that waiting list has increased, yet the staff needed to undertake this crucial work and assist children who may be at physical, social and emotional risk have not been provided. The Government is still adopting a crisis management stance on child welfare issues. That attitude must change urgently.</P>
    <P>Significant additional responsibilities are placed on health boards under this legislation. As it stands, the health boards cannot cope with the level of demand for child welfare services. Currently there are almost 500 children awaiting referral to a social worker in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area alone. That is a scandal in itself. Now we are discussing placing substantial new responsibilities on health boards and bringing under their responsibility all those children between the ages of seven and 12 who previously would have been the responsibility of the criminal justice system. There is a huge demand for additional staff. The lead-in to making those staff available is at least four years because that is the length of the training course available currently for social workers, both within the health boards and in the Probation and Welfare Service. Massive recruitment and training needs to be done before any additional staff will be in place.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staff shortages, the chronic lack of proper residential units to deal with existing demand is nothing short of a disgrace. Time and again in the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly has been forced to call the Government to account for failing to vindicate the constitutional rights of troubled children in the face of official inertia.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year lawyers representing a number of children who are in need of urgent and specialised care had to seek an injunction forcing the Department of Education and Science to live up to the commitments it had given to provide additional secure units. The Department went to court seeking to ditch the timetable it had agreed to at an earlier hearing. Fortunately, the Department lost that case and has been required to build the agreed units. However, that it has taken a legal injunction to force the Government to provide even the most basic number of secure units, beggars belief.</P>
    <P>It is indicative of a Government which refuses to place the welfare of children at the top of its political agenda. Child welfare and protection is one of the most serious social problems facing the country today, yet it has been delegated to a junior Minister with responsibilities spanning three Departments. There is no dedicated voice for children at the Cabinet table. There is no Department of Children which could cut through the ridiculous red tape created by the current administrative structures. There is no one in Government who can shout &lsquo;stop' when a teenage girl, who has committed no crime but needs care and support, is sent to an institution for the criminally insane <Col N="110" /> because no other facilities are available. Neither was there anyone to shout &lsquo;stop' when any of the other cases, referred to by Deputy Neville, arose. They have reflected badly on the country's political structures and they are shameful.</P>
    <P>Drift, not determination, is the hallmark of the Government's current policy. That is the situation that exists today. With debate and amendment this Bill can provide part of the statutory reform needed to radically improve child welfare services. However, without the political commitment to provide the considerable funds required to implement the Bill and reform of our social services, little will change. The Government has not grasped the size of the challenge facing it. The Government believes in a low tax, no spend society and is happy to preside over rapidly escalating gaps between rich and poor. It is a Government which does not believe in investing in the services necessary to build a decent and fair Republic. It would far rather slash taxes for land speculators, and that is precisely what it has done.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental contradiction in bringing before the House a Bill such as this, which demands significant additional current spending &ndash; a concept which is anathema to those in Government who hold the purse strings. I fear that this fundamental political contradiction will result in even more inertia and prevarication in our child welfare services. The record of this Government to date offers no alternative conclusion.</P>
    <P>I will speak about a number of proposals in the Bill which runs to 272 sections. Part III amends the Child Care Act, 1991, as it relates to children in need of special care or protection who have not committed an offence but where:</P>
    <P>the behaviour of the child is such that it poses a real and substantial risk to his or her health, safety, development or welfare, and the child requires special care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the court makes such an order.</P>
    <P>Why was this section, and that dealing with family conferences, not brought in as separate legislation to amend the Child Care Acts, instead of being included in this Bill, the rest of which deals with the issue of juvenile justice? The Minister must also be aware that due to the chronic lack of appropriate services at present, families and social workers may be left with no other course of action but to avail of this section of the Bill to ensure that a child is provided with the required supports and services. If current child welfare services are not improved then obtaining special care orders may be the only way that those who care about the welfare of troubled children can access appropriate services.</P>
    <P>I am also wary of the tone and language in this section of the Bill. The section deals extensively with issues such as the detention of a child in a special care unit, the obligation on the health board to prevent the child injuring itself or others, and the obligation to prevent children <Col N="111" /> absconding from custody. However, not enough emphasis is given to the care, education and welfare of the child, surely the most important function of any special care or protection orders. I also regret that the Bill does not specify how often special care units should be inspected and fails to establish an independent body to inspect these units. That is a serious failing which I hope we can deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in sections 7 to 16 which deal with family welfare conferences. They provide a sensible framework within which a child, its family and the appropriate agencies can discuss a range of problems and formulate an action plan which, ideally, can be worked upon within the family context and without the need to resort to special care orders. Sadly, however, as we know, this will not always be the case.</P>
    <P>While the Bill provides for an administrative service for the conferences, it seems to ignore the issue of financial assistance for families participating in them. There is no provision for private family time at these conferences. Surely if we are serious about encouraging young people and their families to take responsibility for their behaviour, the families should be encouraged and facilitated to be active agents in drawing up these plans, and not merely the guests of the State at a conference.</P>
    <P>What is disturbing about this section is that family welfare conferences will only be convened at the direction of a court or a health board, in reality when crisis intervention is necessary. A major failing of this Bill is that it does not facilitate early intervention in families with problems. The model of the family welfare conference proposed in the Bill could be extremely beneficial to many families when problems first arise and they need assistance and support from social services. However, the Bill fails to recognise this fact and there is no vision of a child welfare service that goes beyond the notion of crisis management. Unfortunately, intervention at an early stage rarely happens and when it does, it is often too little, too late for many families.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 51 in Part IV establishes the Garda diversion programme on a statutory footing. These important sections propose a new framework for dealing with juvenile crime. The scale of juvenile crime and its often appalling effects on a community is a growing problem. Last year approximately 15,000 juveniles were reported to the juvenile office by means of a juvenile referral form. In the first four months of last year alone, 2,687 juveniles were arrested in the Dublin area. Juvenile crime is a serious and growing problem, but one the Minister seems to be overlooking entirely through his procrastination.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill to put on a statutory basis the response of the Garda Síochána to this problem are welcome, but it is only a partial response. That respect for the law, for neighbours and for one's local community is absent from a large proportion of our young people is deeply <Col N="112" /> disturbing. Does the Minister not accept that by the time many of these people come to the attention of the Garda, through the juvenile liaison scheme, they are so alienated from society that intervention is very often too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister's delay in granting any kind of urgency to the preparation of modern juvenile justice legislation has left the Garda in limbo. They simply do not know what to do. Gardaí have neither the expertise nor the resources for the kind of intervention that is required to deal with juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>No direction has been forthcoming from the Government for the past three years. The scale of juvenile crime, with over 15,000 arrests a year, is the strongest argument for a comprehensive early intervention child care service. Early intervention, which will deal directly with the circumstances which often lead young children into criminal activities, is urgently required. Yet again this Bill fails to provide for such a service and children at risk may only receive the help and support they need when they are already engaged in anti-social and indeed criminal activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals for restorative cautioning specifically mentioned in the Bill. Forcing young offenders to face up to the trauma and damage that their actions have caused is a progressive and worthwhile policy. There is merit in the suggestion that conferences convened under the terms of this section should be chaired by a neutral chairperson as distinct from a juvenile liaison officer. I hope the Minister will respond to this in summing up. That is no reflection on the juvenile liaison service, which has been very progressive in this regard. However, it is inappropriate that a proper conference of this nature should be chaired by a person seen to be a party to it. If these conferences are to operate effectively and have the full confidence of the families concerned they must be seen to be independent. The terms of employment of the chairperson will be critical to building that confidence. The action plans provided for will generally have cost implications and it is not clear from the Bill where the resources will come from. I seek the Minister's clarification on that as it is so important it should be covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide courts with a wider range of non-custodial options for young offenders is long overdue. I received information from the Department of Education and Science last year that 19 children were serving custodial sentences of up to three years in some cases for not attending school or truancy. This is a regressive, damaging and ultimately futile policy to pursue. How locking a child up in a detention centre will change his or her attitude to formal schooling escapes logic. It is time the courts had the power to take an inclusive and comprehensive approach to the problems facing a child which comes before the court and applies a sentence which, while punishing an offender for a crime, appreciates that these people are still children and need support and assistance rather than penal custodial <Col N="113" /> sentences if they are to have any positive future in society.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;detention schools&rdquo; is particularly distasteful and I ask the Minister to consider changing it. I see no difficulty with the existing term &ldquo;special schools.&rdquo;  I am concerned by the proposals in Part X of the Bill which require directors of detention schools to admit every child referred to them. Will this proposal not lead to the development of a revolving door syndrome? Will children who are serving sentences have training and rehabilitation courses disrupted and terminated early as they are released to make way for new referrals that the detention school will be legally required to accept? This is a difficult area. I am not suggesting we revert to a situation where people can be refused, as there seems to be no follow-up with those children who are refused at present. I recently came across the case of a child sentenced to two years' detention and when gardaí took him to the detention centre they were told there was no room, so he was simply sent back to the community to continue causing the havoc he had been causing for the previous two years. All Members will agree that such cases cannot be allowed to continue, but we cannot have a situation where children are moved out of detention centres as we will have a revolving door syndrome such as that which operates in adult prisons.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned by sections 56 and 57 of the Bill which relate to the detention of children in Garda custody. It is extremely worrying that even if this Bill passes into law there still exists the prospect of children who are detained in Garda custody being held with adults. Surely the Minister could have identified a network of Garda stations which have dedicated facilities for children and that the gardaí would be required to avail of these facilities if accommodation separating children from adults was not available in their base station.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part XII of the Bill which deals with the protection of children and in particular section 247 which re-enacts the offence of causing or procuring a child to beg. The work which the Leanbh project has undertaken in close co-operation with the gardaí in recent times highlights the scandal of child begging and the stark fact that some parents force their children to beg. I hope this section will bring a halt to this practice.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not radically differ from the Children's Bill, 1996.</P>

      <P>The fact that we have had to wait for three years until the Government figured out how to deal with this legislation demonstrates the incompetence and confusion that rules Government policy on children's issues. The Bill is comprehensive. However, to claim that it represents a radical departure for child care services or juvenile justice is inaccurate. The overriding problem with our child welfare services is the pro<Col N="114" /> vision of resources, staff and direction. The Bill does not even attempt to address those issues and many sections seem designed to fit into the crisis management ethos that dominates our child welfare services. Until the chronic underfunding that has crippled these services is overcome there will be little real difference for the hundreds of children and families who feel stranded and isolated when a serious problem arises with a child or within the family. The Bill is lacking in vision and ambition. It fails to outline or guarantee the financial commitments which are necessary for its implementation and fails to chart a new course for child welfare services where early intervention as distinct from crisis management is the policy goal. It seeks to contain and control a growing problem of juvenile crime and anti-social behaviour without even considering how the causes of this problem can be tackled much earlier in communities, before children come into contact with the Garda.</P>
      <P>I have more to say on this Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage. I hope we will not wait as long for Committee Stage as we have waited for Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo mar Aire Stáit leis an Aire, Teachta O'Donoghue. If one looks back to 1908 one could say this Bill is a long time coming, but one could equally say it was worth waiting for. It is the culmination of a long process and has the benefit of the expertise and knowledge of my predecessor, Deputy Currie. However, it also has the benefit of extra research, experience and knowledge, not just in our Department and country but from international sources also.</P>
      <P>The Bill shows sincere and genuine high level co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science. The same work that went into preparing the Bill will also go into ensuring that co-operation continues for its implementation. The Bill also underlines the Government's commitment to tackling not only child welfare but social exclusion, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium. We have seen how children have suffered from social exclusion. As has been said, unfortunately some children are living on the streets and others have had to go to court to have their rights protected. However, we can say we are facing up to these problems and this Bill represents one way of dealing with them. The resources and plans being implemented outside the legislative framework are equally important.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises, as does everyone, that the best place for a child is within his or her family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure in recent weeks of attending fora organised by the ISPCC in Cork, Dublin and Galway. About 200 children attended at each venue and when asked what the most important thing was in their lives, family came to the fore each time. The Government has a policy of sup<Col N="115" /> porting families and children within their families and communities in order that they can create their own solutions. We are providing new structures and resources for children and, as the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, I want to restate the Government's commitment to further develop these services.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill recognises at its core the importance of individual children and it also recognises the importance of parents. It draws together support structures such as health boards, the Garda and other interested bodies which will not only work in the interests of all children but also in the interests of individual children. The Bill recognises that while children and their individual circumstances are different, there are certain similarities. All children need our care and protection, be they children with special needs who have never been in trouble but whose behaviour means they require special care, children on the edge of the law, children before the courts or children who have offended. The Bill rightly spans the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's most important features, which distinguishes it from any previous legislation, is the family welfare conferences which relate to all kinds of children, particularly children who require special care. One of the most important elements of the family welfare conferences &ndash; and this may address a point raised by Deputy Neville &ndash; will be that children will be present at the conferences. Too often, we talk about children and on their behalf. Not only will children be present at the conferences but where recommendations are made for them, the children will be notified in writing.</P>
    <P>The family conferences will be in a position to make recommendations to health boards on the care and protection requirements of individual children. The procedure will provide a system for the early identification of children who are at risk and a means of providing support and assistance for those children, following inter-agency intervention. The family conference is one of the structures which will enable us to ensure that children who require special care and protection will only be sent to a special care unit as a very last resort. One of the main recommendations which can be made by the conference relates not to the making of a care order but, alternatively, to the provision of services and assistance to children and their families.</P>
    <P>However, we recognise that there are children whose behaviour poses a real and substantial risk to their own health, safety, development and welfare and that those children, although small in number, require special care orders. Such children require secure accommodation and possibly cannot be catered for in our general residential care system. This Bill will ensure that their needs are met.</P>
    <P>It is important for children in the above cate<Col N="116" /> gory and others in special residential care that they would be able to maintain links with their families and communities. It is essential that whether children are placed under care orders for six or 12 months or whether they are placed in long-term care until 18 years of age, they should be able to maintain those links because they must be able to reintegrate into their communities.</P>
    <P>A range of services, from family support services to special fostering arrangements, will be available to children who require special protection or special care. A working party is currently examining the issue of special fostering and I look forward to seeing its report to see how best we can build on the very valuable work already being done in this area.</P>
    <P>Where children are placed in special care by the State, it is important that would occur in units approved by the Minister and that such units would be inspected. For this reason, the social services inspectorate was established on a non-statutory basis in April 1999 to monitor all the social services operated by the health boards. For the first three years, the inspectorate will concentrate on child care, particularly on residential care. The inspectorate's main function is to support child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. It will inspect children's residential homes, monitor the organisation, operation and management of child care services and evaluate the quality and responsiveness of services as experienced by the users and the carers which will hopefully result in an improvement of standards.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate has already commenced its inspection programme. It is envisaged that one inspection will have been carried out in each health board area by May of this year. To date, six inspections and a pilot inspection have been carried out. At a recent conference of Irish care workers in Ennis, which I had the pleasure of addressing, one of the speakers stated that the inspectorate's inspection had been an inspiration. I hope that will be the view of all of the inspections carried out in order that we can ensure that where children are under our care, they receive quality care and service as they are children for whom all other options have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines a variety of options for children who come before the law which I acknowledge is the last place we want to find children. Early intervention and the prevention of children's involvement in criminal activity is extremely important. Detention should be and is a last resort. In this respect, the Garda diversion programme which relates to children who accept responsibility for their crimes is very valuable. The family conferences will investigate the reasons behind children's involvement in crime and will proceed to see how children and their families can be supported and prevented from proceeding any further. The conferences will treat children as individuals.</P>
    <P>An action plan for each child will be agreed with him or her, not by someone on his or her <Col N="117" /> behalf. The action plans will include a range of measures from children making apologies to their victims, a measure we know has been successful in other countries, to the possible payment or making of reparation. The importance of children's involvement in other activities, such as sport and recreation, will also be an element in the action plans. The importance of children continuing to receive a full education will be particularly highlighted.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the action plans will be able to recommend that children or young people should stay away from certain places or people in order to avoid involvement in criminal activity. The Bill also refers to children who have been found guilty of offences and, again, all options will be explored before children are detained. These options might necessitate children being supervised by parents or mentors, attendance at a day centre and, although the word is not mentioned in the Bill, may involve a curfew element, particularly at night.</P>
    <P>In recognising the importance of individual children, the Bill also recognises the role and importance of parents. Parents are crucial to the family conferences and are obliged to attend court proceedings. Deputy Shortall referred to seemingly parent-less children, parents who do not take responsibility for their children. It is important that parents would be obliged to attend in court and be made aware of the repercussions of their children's actions.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises there are parents who need special help because they are not capable of giving their children proper guidance. Under the Bill, they can be sent for treatment for drug addition or alcohol abuse and for lessons in parenting skills in order to protect and support their families.</P>
    <P>The fact that parents and children are recognised means that detention will only be used when all else fails; it is a last resort. It is unfortunate that children are taken away from their parents but this is often done for the good of the child, the victim and society. As also applies to taking children into care, we must ensure all options are used and that responsibility is taken for children, bearing in mind their background, age and circumstances, in order to protect those who come before us.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that children have come before the courts. It is an appalling vista that any child has to go to the High Court to protect his or her rights or seek care in a special home. Mr. Justice Geoghegan's decision in 1995 was referred to. It took this Government to devise a plan to provide places for children who need special care or high support.</P>

In conjunction <Col N="118" /> with the health boards, we have devised a plan which will meet the needs in each health board area in order to ensure children do not have to go to the High Court to obtain their rights. A special care unit will be provided in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and will consist of 24 places in Ballydowd, 24 high support places in Portrane, etc. This is not a long-term plan &ndash; 56 of those places will come on stream this year. It is not just a plan; it is backed up by considerable resources. This year £30 million will be spent on residential child care services.</P>

      <P>The programme is agreed and will be supported by this Bill. It is important that commitments have been given and resources provided.</P>
      <P>There has been justifiable criticism of the lack of links between the three Departments responsible for residential care. This Bill allows for a special residential services board which currently operates on an interim basis. This ensures a system is available to provide the best possible care for our troubled children. The board will advise the Ministers involved on policy, the remand and detention of children in detention schools and children in special care units. Under the terms of the Bill, a child detention order may only be imposed as a last resort. This board will ensure there will be a co-ordinated response in the delivery of residential accommodation and support services to children in the care of the State. These services will be targeted at each child through education and special programmes. I am confident that this body, the establishment of which does not depend on the passing of the Bill, will ensure we co-ordinate services and take responsibility for each child.</P>
      <P>Many other aspects of this Bill will have a major impact on child care services, particularly the raising of the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years, which does not ignore young offenders for whom services will be put in place. The raising of the age of criminal responsibility will increase the likelihood that children will not enter the criminal justice system. I welcome the broadening of the definition of cruelty to children and the recognition that the emotional health and well-being of a child can be damaged by cruelty. Cruelty can now be defined as frightening, bullying or threatening a child. I also welcome the shifting of the burden of proof to adults who send children out to beg. They must now prove they did not do it as there is no doubt that children do not beg on their own initiative.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, Departments come together as responsible bodies. For too long, we have taken a hands-off approach. However, we are now identifying and intervening in problems, supporting children and putting the resources of the State at the disposal of them and their families before they are subject to criminal law. The political will is there and children do not have to be at Cabinet to be heard, at ministerial level to be effective or in a Department to produce results. This Bill, with the commitment and resources of this Government, will deliver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to many outlandish statements and inflated claims from politicians. I have been trying to remember some that might compare with those made by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The only comparable one is the claim of Brian Faulkner that he was responsible for the introduction of one man-one vote. Some of the claims made by the Minister were outrageous. I am sorry the Minister is not present and I hope he will rejoin us quickly because there are some things I would prefer to say to his face, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, rather than in his absence.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say there was a streak of irresponsibility in the Minister when he was Opposition spokesman which, on the evidence of today's speech, has not been removed by his involvement in Government in the past three years. We should face reality; the Minister made irresponsible remarks and claims. He told us he was privileged to open the debate on a flagship item of legislation from this Government. He also said that not only is it a flagship item of legislation but one of the most important and far-reaching Bills to be brought before this House in many years. It is important and far-reaching but it is mostly the Bill that was brought before this House three years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that the wait since 1908 and 1997 was worthwhile and well justified. We have used the time wisely to bring a balanced, comprehensive, innovative and imaginative Bill to fruition. He goes on to say the Bill we are now debating is radically different to that which has gone before. Its underlying philosophy is radically different, just as much as is its provisions and the distillation of the accumulated wisdom and the best practice worldwide in the area of juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>We must face reality. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made one of the most irresponsible contributions ever when as Opposition spokesperson he spoke during the Second Reading of the Children Bill, which I as Minister or State with responsibility for Children introduced in the House on 12 February 1996. Deputy Neville has already given some flavour of the Minister's remarks. I will also do so from the Official Report of Wednesday, 12 February 1997, Volume 474. Referring to the Bill, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>It merely tinkers with solutions and systems which have already been seen to be inadequate. It lacks innovation and vision and merely offers more of the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the parts of the Bill which merely restate existing law in a mildly altered form were to be removed, what would remain would amount to little more than window dressing . . . The Bill seeks to create the illusion of reform while maintaining the status quo . . . The Bill represents a policy of acceptance and resignation rather than a vision for the future. It makes a clear statement that &ldquo;this is the best we can do&rdquo;. It is inadequate and its publication has <Col N="121" /> been rushed to create a semblance of activity in an election year . . . A Government that is serious about juvenile justice would withdraw the Bill and acknowledge it for what it is, a shallow attempt at parliamentary scrabble to create the illusion of activity.</P>
    <P>These were the responsible comments of the Deputy on the Bill. If the 1996 Bill was so bad, if its underlying philosophy was so different, if it was so lacking in innovation and up-to-date thinking and if it was so bad it could not even be amended, why did he not vote against it at the time? Why did he and his party not vote against the Second Reading of the Bill instead of giving it an unopposed return? Is that supposed to be an indication of opposition in this House? If a Deputy is honest, he voices his statements, makes his criticism and follows it through in the lobbies of the House. That is how to signal one's opposition. Despite the words of the Minister, he did not do so; there is a lesson in that.</P>
    <P>I have often listened to Opposition speakers and asked myself what would he or she say or do if he or she were in Government? This is usually a fairly useless exercise, but in this case the unusual has occurred. The then Opposition spokesperson is now the Minister and, even more unusually, has responsibility to the House for the very legislation he attacked so vehemently when in Opposition. Therefore, very exceptionally, a direct comparison can be made and his credibility judged, both as Opposition spokesperson and as Minister. Before making the comparison, let us consider certain advantages the Minister had over the Opposition spokesperson. He certainly has not been rushed for time. The Children Bill, which I introduced in this House, received a Second Reading on 25 February 1997. This has been an inexcusable delay, compounding 25 years of procrastination over a Bill of this nature since it was first mooted, and largely due to the differences of opinion that existed between the three Departments of Health, Education and Justice. Different excuses were put forward at different times for the three year delay. On 29 May 1998 the Government Chief Whip informed me in writing that the delay was due to the many submissions from interested groups but that nevertheless it was hoped to commence Committee Stage in June or July 1998. The number of groups who made submissions turned out to be eight and the majority of the points made would have been made anyway in the course of the Committee Stage debate. None was fundamental.</P>
    <P>On 30 March 1999 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed Deputy Shortall that the reason for the delay was an appraisal of the juvenile justice system in other countries and of developments and advances in the juvenile justice area since the Bill was published in 1996. The Minister added that part of the appraisal involved the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Fahey, visiting New Zealand to study at first hand that country's system of juvenile justice. Apart from <Col N="122" /> the fact that I as Minister of State had already visited New Zealand to look at the juvenile justice system and also the ombudsman for children &ndash; elements of the juvenile justice system had been incorporated in the 1996 Bill &ndash; the lack of product from New Zealand, so to speak, exposes the Chief Whip's letter for the excuse it was. Fortunately we got the real reason for the delay in a reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to Deputy Neville on 2 November 1999 when he said that the 1996 Bill was delayed to ensure and I quote, &ldquo;that it took account of comments I made in my contribution when Opposition spokesperson to the Second Stage debate on the 1996 Bill&rdquo;. We have from the horse's mouth the real reason for the delay of more than three years in producing the Bill before us today. This is an attempt to justify the irresponsible criticism of the Minister when he was Opposition spokesperson.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the 1996 Bill would have proceeded to Committee Stage, where amendments would have been made despite the change of Government, except for the irresponsible speech by Deputy O'Donoghue. The original irresponsibility is built upon and added to by what approximates to criminal irresponsibility in delaying the Bill for three years. Deputies Neville and Shortall have already referred to learned judges, particularly Mr. Justice Kelly, who has been forced to comment on the lack of secure places for out-of-control children. Recently Mr. Justice Kelly was reported in the media as having condemned the legislative inaction which forced him to send a 17 year old girl, who was considered a serious risk to herself, to the Central Mental Hospital. The judge criticised the continuing failure to enact the Children Bill. In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 March, Mr. Justice Kelly is reported to have said that the Minister for Health and Children would have to find in short order an appropriate place for a 13 year old out-of-control boy or run the risk of being in contempt of court. In another reported case on 10 March, the judge had to send an extremely disturbed 17 year old girl to the Central Mental Hospital. The judge asked, &ldquo;Where else can I send her?&rdquo; Because of the State's failure there was neither an appropriate facility or a legislative framework to deal with such a situation. It was left to him to do the best he could in circumstances where the Executive and the Legislature had, to use his words &ldquo;signally failed&rdquo;. The judge's words represent a major condemnation of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. We have heard from Deputy Shortall about what happened over those three wasted years and the finger points to the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately from the Minister's point of view we also have his own words which are an indictment of himself. On 2 November 1999, Deputy Neville asked the Minister in a written parliamentary question the differences between the Children Bill, 1996, and the Children Bill, <Col N="123" /> 1999, and if he would itemise the differences in detail &ndash; Official Report, Vol. 509, col. 1697. He has already referred to the most significant changes. I refer to a number of them: raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years, which I welcome; the 1996 Bill also proposed to raise the age to 12, but first to ten years and through three yearly reviews to 12. There is no difference in principle. It was subject to resources as I made clear on Second Stage when I said:</P>
    <P>There is an irrebuttable presumption that a child under the age of criminal responsibility is incapable of crime. This means there can be no compulsory intervention in respect of the anti-social activities of such a child which, if committed by an older person would be an offence. Therefore, there has to be an alternative, credible way to deal with problem children. The framework provided in the Bill is that the health boards will have responsibility for these children. When the necessary resources are in place the health boards will be in a position to provide a range of supports for this under 12 age group.</P>
    <P>The view in 1996 was that the necessary resources were not yet in place. If the position has changed, I welcome it but do not let the Minister claim it as a major reforming initiative. Did not the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, say of the 1996 provision:</P>
    <P>If an age of criminal responsibility is to have any meaning in the late 20th century, it must be seen to refer to mental and not physical age. This Bill wholly ignores this issue. As far as the Government is concerned, the issue does not exist. . . . An opportunity for reform has been squandered; yet another issue has been side-stepped.</P>
    <P>What a lack of consistency and credibility on the part of the Minister. The reply to Deputy Neville continues:</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for a family welfare conference. This will be a preventative measure, organised by the health boards, aimed at providing services for children at risk and their families.</P>
    <P>There will be the introduction of a court directed and supervised family conference. Did the Minister even read the 1996 Bill? All these matters were contained in it. The Minister's reply to Deputy Neville continues:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to ensure that any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures an under-age child to &ldquo;commit an offence&rdquo; will be guilty of that offence.</P>
    <P>I agree with that. On the Second Reading of the 1996 Bill, I had already agreed to consider such a proposal before Committee Stage because it was suggested to me by Deputy Shortall and Deputy <Col N="124" /> O'Donnell at that time. The Minister's reply to Deputy Neville continues:</P>
    <P>. . . the previous plan for a single board of management for the children detention schools is being replaced by a proposal that each school or natural grouping of schools will have its own statutory management board appointed by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for this change? What is meant by &ldquo;natural grouping of schools&rdquo;? Will there be any special or opting out arrangements for any school? As the Minister did not explain this in his speech I would like to hear the reason. The reply continues, &ldquo;A new inspection system for the children detention schools is proposed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In light of the serious abuses that have come to light it is obviously of fundamental importance that an inspection system is effective, vigilant and unexpected by those in charge of the schools so that they are not ready when the inspectors arrive. The 1996 Bill proposed an inspection system. Why does the so-called improved Bill drop the provision for an inspection at least once every six months?</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister made great play of forcing parents to be made responsible for their children in terms of compensation for damage to personal property and underlined their parenting function. These matters were also features of the 1996 Bill. Why does this Bill remove from parents the onus to prove that they had reasonable excuse for not attending court proceedings in which their child is involved? The least that can be expected of parents &ndash; I emphasise the plural where possible &ndash; when their child is in court is that they will be in attendance unless they have some good excuses for not attending.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things I wish to say but I will try to confine myself to some of the more glaring things which the Minister said on that occasion and which are or are not included. Speaking on Second Stage of the 1996 Bill, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The provision relating to the Children Court is equally lacking in innovation. The opening section of Part V declares: &ldquo;The District Court when hearing charges against children . . . . shall be known as the Children Court . . . .&rdquo;. The section represents no more than the triumph of form over substance. If something does not work effectively, the Minister's solution is to change its name. The concept of substantive changes is clearly beyond the Minister's comprehension and capacity. The existing Children's Court is to be abolished and, in its place, the Minister proposes to establish a Children Court. This semblance of change takes the place of much needed reform.</P>
    <P>We find exactly the same wording in the 1999 Bill, except that it is now Part VII. Those are good stirring words, dramatically spoken, even if lacking in the positive. The Minister's Bill in this <Col N="125" /> respect is exactly the same. It is performances like this that give politicians and politics a bad name.</P>

      <P>After three years of consideration, research, consultation and foreign visits by the Minister what have we have got? A feeble result of the Minister's engagement in a deep analysis is to produce this radically different and innovative Bill. It is the result of a considered reappraisal of the 1996 Bill. What nonsense. In 1997 the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, asked why the Bill was so bereft of vision? Why do we have pages of plagiarism, restatement and re-enactment? It is no substitute for a policy and the Government is clearly bereft of a policy on young offenders. Those comments were not true then in relation to the 1996 Bill. They have more substance now.</P>

      <P>Deputy Currie was vociferous when heading up the taskforce referred to by Deputy Shortall and was the dedicated voice at Cabinet for children. In the other House he was described as the Minister for procrastination. I would concur with the last phrase. I came into the Chamber, having listened to the speeches of the previous speakers, with a view to speaking on the Bill, which is a good one. I would not have said in this Chamber that the 1996 Bill was a bad Bill. It was probably a good Bill and the Minister mentioned that in his speech. I was surprised that during the contribution of Deputy Currie, who was the designated voice for children in the previous Government, I did not once hear him refer to the contents of the Bill nor to how it best served the interests of children. The proceedings in the House during the past few hours give politics a bad name. The main thrust of Deputy Currie's contribution was his claim that he did it first and better and that the Minister's Bill is bad. Is it any wonder that politics and politicians are held in such low esteem?</P>

      <P>I can tell Deputy Shortall a <Col N="126" /> joke. The previous Government introduced legislation for which the necessary resources were not provided. At that time I brought a young man to a health centre where I was told that because there was an embargo on staff recruitment, the Child Care Act, 1991 was not being implemented. That young man is dead. Opposition Deputies cannot afford to throw brickbats. The Opposition parties have left themselves scandalously open to criticism. Deputy Shortall admitted that the child welfare services have been in a deplorable condition for years. No one in this House can pretend that he or she has done more than anyone else.

      <P>It would be very easy for the Labour Party to publish a Bill and look for glory but not put resources in place to implement it. The Labour Party has not ever done that. The Labour Party was in Government for five years. Deputy Currie accused the Minister of taking three years to publish this Bill. Deputy Currie published his Bill in 1996 and brought it to second stage only when he was about to leave office. Deputy Shortall's party was in office for the five years of the previous Government.

      <P>I agree there is a crisis in the child welfare services. I support anyone who attempts to improve the situation of children who are in difficulties or who find themselves involved with the juvenile justice system. If the Government which I support attempts to improve their situation I am proud to be associated with it. I have a particular interest in this subject which is not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> I welcome the provision for family welfare conferences. The entire Bill is innovative and I join the Minister in acknowledging the innovation of the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Shortall in her concern that family welfare conferences would be put into effect only in times of crisis. I understand that they can be triggered in two ways &ndash; if the courts are involved or if the health board welfare services deem a family welfare conference necessary. If that kind of early intervention is possible within the Bill I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Early intervention of the statutory services is already happening. I met a residents' group in my constituency which is suffering daily and nightly from a group of unruly young people. Some of these young people are lawless and some have parents who do not give them any support and do not take responsibility for them. Attending the meeting was a big burly man who appeared well able to look after himself and who would take on anyone who might put his family at risk. This man broke down and cried in front of local authority officials and other residents. A local authority official responded that the local authority could not do anything about these young people and the support services had already been put at the disposal of the families to try to help the children to allow their neighbours to live in peace and harmony. Where the statutory services are attempting to help in such situations there must be an onus on parents to take part in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 9(2) states: &ldquo;If, in the course of a family welfare conference, the co-ordinator is of opinion that the continued presence of any person is not in the best interest of the conference or the child, the co-ordinator may exclude that person from further participation in the conference.&rdquo;  This is very important. Very often young people are afraid or are manipulated by another person in the course of a meeting. It is vital that someone contributing negatively to a conference or who appears to be forcing a child to respond in a particular way should be excluded from the conference.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned special care units for children in need of special care or protection. These are children who are not offending but who are out of control. Deputy Shortall gave statistics about children and some very high profile cases have been reported in the newspapers. We must look after children who are not yet offending but who are out of control. The young people to whom I referred when I spoke of attending a residents' meeting are such children. There is an urgent need to do something for them. The courts have pointed out this need to legislators and told us that we have a responsibility to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which directs a garda to deliver a child in his or her custody to the child's home. This provision is valuable for a number of reasons. It is better that a child be dealt with in his or her home surroundings, ide<Col N="128" /> ally with his or her parents, rather than have the parents brought to a Garda station. Witnessing the child's home circumstances at first hand may lead to a realisation on the part of the garda that there is a need to involve the welfare services.</P>
    <P>Section 16, paragraph 23F provides for the variation or discharge of special care orders. This is an important provision to avoid the view that a child has been placed in a special care unit to serve time. It will give the child hope for the future if the persons looking after him or her come to the view that their family circumstances have improved to the point where they can return home.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to raising the age of criminal responsibility from 7 years &ndash; which was described as barbaric by other European countries &ndash; to 12 years. Those who encourage young children to commit a criminal offence in the belief that nothing will happen to them will now find themselves in serious difficulty. Deputy Shortall mentioned the practice of sending young children out to beg. I know of young children in my constituency who have been threatened by known criminals that if they do not sell small quantities of drugs they will be beaten up.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was criticised when he did not appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for children. In a way this back-fired in the sense that Departments were reluctant to work together. The Bill is strewn with references to the effect that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will work with the Minister for Education and Science to try to achieve given objectives. The same level of co-operation was not achieved when one person had overall responsibility. It is therefore welcome that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will interface with the welfare services to meet the needs of children involved in crime or suffering from neglect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for saying this Bill is both innovative and reforming. Sections 111 and 112 in Part IX which deal with parental supervision orders and non-compliance with such orders will pin down the issue of parental responsibility once and for all. There have been calls by individuals and groups to make parents responsible for the actions of their children. To use a Dublin phrase, &ldquo;when you are rearing you have to be sparing&rdquo;. We hope our children will not get into difficulty and will not end up before the courts or involved with the Garda Síochána, but the total abdication of responsibilities by some parents in the rearing their children is not permissible; it is not acceptable to allow children to run wild, roam and commit crime and to throw one's hands up in the air and say, &ldquo;There is nothing I can do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under these sections parents may be obliged to undergo treatment for alcohol or substance abuse or to participate in courses designed to improve their parenting skills. This cannot but be good for the child concerned. There are thriving young mothers' groups in many Dublin constituencies &ndash; the churches are also involved to a huge <Col N="129" /> degree &ndash; which provide personal development and parenting skills courses which are availed of in the main by lone parents who want to do what is best for their children by providing opportunities that they themselves did not have. The proposed sanctions should therefore be seen in a positive light.</P>
    <P>Sections 118 and 123 deal with day centre orders. I appreciate the tremendous work being done by Candle Community Trust under the aegis of the probation and welfare service on behalf of young people at risk in the Ballyfermot area of my constituency. It had been working with and trying to help the two young men whose bodies were found in the canal. The Minister has put his money where his mouth is and granted the trust substantial funds to expand its activities. This has not gone unnoticed and is greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>Sections 133 to 136 deal with restriction on movement orders which amount in effect to the imposition of a curfew. On the passing of this Bill I will be able say to the group to which I referred, that the young people who are terrorising them and making their lives a misery will be stopped and told that they will have to remain indoors. This will be a source of great comfort for people who are trying to rear their families as best they can and live their lives in peace. The Garda response to date that there is nothing it can do has been a source of frustration and has given rise to a feeling of hopelessness among those who are at the mercy of unruly youths.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and do not care who initiated it or whether it is better than the first. I welcome its provisions which will go a long way towards improving the lives of those who want to live in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which has been in gestation for the past five years was initially introduced by Deputy Currie in 1996. More important, Deputy Currie was the Minister of State with direct responsibility for children's affairs. It was a novel appointment in that his portfolio spanned three Departments, the then Departments of Justice, Education and Health. That move was the first deliberate act on the part of any Government since the foundation of the State to recognise that the problems affecting young children in particular must be the responsibility of one Minister. I welcome the fact that when my party leader was Taoiseach, he appointed Deputy Currie to that new role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Currie, in a pretty short period after the formation of that Government, put a huge amount of work into the establishment of the Children Bill, 1996. It is regrettable that it has taken the Government another three years, since coming into office in 1997, to introduce this measure which everyone accepts is virtually the same as the 1996 Bill. One of the reasons it has taken three years to debate the Bill again in the House is that in 1996 the comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, <Col N="130" /> Deputy O'Donoghue, were excessive, unfair and unwise. The comments obviously had their source in another place and they were ill-judged at the time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there is a terrible habit of introducing laws and putting resources in place afterwards, but if the law had been in place three years ago it would have allowed the Minister and his Department much greater latitude with the Department of Finance in terms of getting more resources and the argument about resources which is taking place at present would be redundant because the resources would have to be found. That is the net point concerning the rather silly display of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, over recent years. I have heard Deputy Currie ask repeatedly when are we going to see this legislation and I regret it has taken until the year 2000 to be introduced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and am grateful we have an opportunity to debate it. I support the provisions in the Bill but seek clarification on a number of points. It is a sign of legislative inertia that most of the legal provisions surrounding children's rights and children who come into contact with the law stem from the 1908 Act. One of the points made in a policy document, which my party produced on this subject in the 1980s and early 1990s, is that the 1908 Act is dated. It is a sign of the times that it has taken more than 90 years to produce reforming legislation.</P>
    <P>One would question how any legislation could make a huge impact on the lives of children who get into trouble, particularly those who get into trouble with the law. I hope the Bill will have an impact in that regard because if today's juvenile crime is not stopped and these children's behaviour is not altered, they will become the adult criminals of tomorrow. Some years ago the McBride report highlighted clearly that one third of all crimes in the State were committed by people under the age of 17. Whitaker, in his report, stated that one third of all juveniles in detention centres had problems which were directly related to alcohol and drug abuse, and the rate of recidivism among juvenile criminals was between 50% and 80%. Therefore, there is an obligation to change the pattern of behaviour of children who come into contact with the law. If the State does not do so, it is clear from the evidence which has been obtained that they will continue to commit crime, they will be in and out of prison and their lives will not be worth living.</P>
    <P>The use of places of detention for children should be the last resort. The United Nations has highlighted that it is a scandal that such a significant group of young people must remain in detention centres in Ireland. In comparison with all the international evidence, Ireland comes bottom of the heap in this regard. We, as a mature society with so much resources at our disposal, have a responsibility to change this position.</P>
    <P>Community service orders have never really been utilised. If somebody has a difficulty with the law, there is a tradition that the immediate <Col N="131" /> way out is to pay a fine or, in the case of the Bill, to pay compensation to the victim. While that is obviously important, doing something practical for problem children is much more important than simply paying a fine. Paying a fine to the State is a once-off action, whereas a much more useful exercise would be to ensure that children who come into contact with the law are given something practical to do over a period of time by way of community service orders. These orders are self-constraining and they involve doing something practical for society.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, allowed for community service orders to be made against persons who are over 16. Will the Bill allow community service orders to be given to people under 16? For instance, if a 15 year old gets into difficulty, is it possible that a community service order would be made against that minor? Under the 1983 legislation, the maximum duration of a community service order is 240 hours. Is it possible, under the Bill, to increase this limit? The way forward is through the use of community service orders. The record of applying them in the State is poor and that is something which the Minister must identify, particularly when it comes to juvenile justice.</P>
    <P>As others have said, there is a fairly strong relationship between low levels of academic attainment and delinquency. That is why another Bill which is currently before a committee of the House, the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, is so important. If we are really serious about identifying problem children, one of the ways to do that is to ensure that children who are at risk in terms of dropping out of full-time education are identified. It is a scandal that there is no strategy to deal with children who are dropping out of the schools on a daily basis. In some schools in this city upwards of one third of children are not at school on any given day. It is not surprising that these are the children who end up before the courts five years down the road. There is a huge responsibility on the State to provide intervention strategies which will ensure that those children are brought back into mainstream education and given something positive to do.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with juvenile crime, which is witnessed by every Deputy who represents an urban constituency, is that peer group pressure has a huge impact on children who are running amuck on the streets. Recently I came across a case where a women, who recently attained a new job and got a car as a result, is now being picked upon in that community by a gang of 14 to 15 year olds simply because she is doing something which is alien to a large percentage of people in that housing estate. It is a scandal that one or two ringleaders can use peer group pressure to suck in a group of hoodlums to impact so negatively on the quality of life of that woman. It is absolutely disgraceful and there are many such examples. If we are really serious about creating positive peer group pressure we must give children, particularly <Col N="132" /> in deprived areas, something very positive to do. In many estates on the fringes of this city there are large gangs of children who have nothing to do and who are roaming the streets in the afternoons and evenings causing mayhem. They are picking on women in particular, especially those on their own looking after children, and on people who have obtained employment and who are in a sense trying to better themselves. We must find strategies to ensure those children are dealt with. Each day a large proportion of my work in my constituency is based upon dealing with children who are out of control and the impact they have on life in housing estates. We are not talking about serious crime, but the intimidation people are suffering on a daily basis as a result of the failure of the Garda in some instances to be on the streets dealing with those children. We must address this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that early intervention in terms of children getting into trouble is a central theme of the Bill which identifies those who drop out from school and children on the run. One of the points made by Fr. McVerry some days ago was that youth homelessness has virtually doubled over a period of five years. We are talking about children who frequently come in contact with the law. It is a scandal that despite the wealth in the economy we have still not provided adequate accommodation and shelter for large groups of people on our streets. It is quite clear that young males in particular make up a large section of the homeless people in the city. We have not developed the kind of temporary and emergency accommodation to ensure those people are taken off the streets. Government must address this in a collective way.</P>
    <P>I welcome family welfare conferencing as part of the Bill. Parents must take the responsibility if their child is causing trouble in an area. Too often in urban areas the gardaí tell politicians and community and social workers that the problem is that parents will not take responsibility for their child, that when the reality is presented to them they simply do not want to know.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome that under the Bill a judge will be clearly able to compel a parent to attend before him and ensure that the parent is part of the family welfare conferencing. What number of conferences will be required and will the necessary funding be provided to ensure the resources for health boards and the local gardaí are put in place? I would also like the Minister in his reply to Second Stage to say if training has begun in terms of the Bill. It is quite clear that new skills will be required by the convenors of these conferences and I am interested to know the training his Department has put in place to ensure action can be taken. Resources, therefore, is a key aspect, and unless they are put in place the provisions in the Bill will not be workable.</P>
    <P>The Garda juvenile liaison scheme has been working for quite some years and I welcome that for the first time it is being put on a statutory basis. The scheme can only work with proper <Col N="133" /> community policing structures. One of the most important aspects of policing, particularly in Dublin, is community policing based on a dedicated number of gardaí spending considerable periods of time working in communities. They know the troublemakers and can clearly identify the children who are going off the rails. I take this opportunity to congratulate the community division of each Garda station. The problem is that a year after all the information is obtained by the community garda, he or she might be taken off the beat in that housing estate and be moved up the line into detective work. We must develop the community policing model as the most attractive model of policing. Many gardaí feel that detective and special branch work or promotion to sergeant is the pinnacle of their career. We must create an entirely new recruitment structure which will ensure community policing is the most important area of work. This should work hand in glove with the aspirations outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is the total number of juvenile liaison officers? According to work I did in the late 1980s and early 1990s there were only 83 juvenile liaison officers in the force which then had a total strength of approximately 10,500 members. I understand that at that time 38 juvenile liaison officers were assigned to Dublin, four to Cork and two each to Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford. There must be a massive expansion in the juvenile liaison programme and the number of officers attached to it. In particular, there must be a concentration in terms of recruitment and promotion in the area of community policing. This is the only way to ensure the information is given adequately in a local setting.</P>
    <P>Others have spoken about the victims, and I would like the Minister to outline the sections of the Bill which deal specifically with compensation. As the Minister is aware the Law Reform Commission examined the issue of liability for child crimes and made six proposals, the most important concerning a compensation fund. The current compensation fund is simply not adequate to meet all the claims made against it. What compensation will a person who is hit by a stolen car driven by a child receive? Will it be effected by the proposals in the Bill? I am interested in the proposals of the Government in terms of liability because unless adequate compensation is given to victims people will feel that justice is not being done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of parental supervision orders in sections 111 and 112. It is proper that we should have the power to curfew children who are causing havoc in their homes or with a mentor. We should also have power to ensure parents take responsibility for that child during that period. Children should not be roaming the streets. Far too often children of ten, 11 or 12 years of age are out until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning. It is not surprising that they get into trouble. The State cannot do everything. I do not accept the notion that implementing laws and putting resources in place will resolve every prob<Col N="134" /> lem in the State. Parents, the primary educators, must have responsibility and in that regard I welcome the fact that parental supervision orders are an essential part of the Bill. On Committee Stage we might examine further how these can be implemented.</P>
    <P>There are many good provisions in the Bill. It should have been brought forward and implemented some years ago, but now let us implement it and ensure it works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Haughey. I have listened to the contributions so far, most of which have been from Dublin and city based Deputies. Deputy Hayes pointed out some issues which once may only have been real to Dublin, but those issues are also becoming common in rural constituencies. In that context I welcome the provisions of the Bill and recognise that the Minister has responded positively to many submissions made in recent years. As a member of a health board, I am aware of the concerns and fears of guardians, parents, gardaí and teachers but the contributions of the Minister and the Minister of State recognised and met their demands.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been described as &ldquo;a blueprint for the development of the new juvenile justice system&rdquo;. It acknowledges that creative solutions and options must be put in place to address the problems of young people in trouble throughout the State. I also recognise that any system dealing with young offenders must retain the ultimate sanction of incarceration but the Bill clearly is based on the premise that this option should only be brought into play after a range of community-based measures have been exhausted.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes four important provisions which relate to the age of criminal responsibility, the protection of children, the diversion programme and juvenile liaison scheme and family welfare conferences. I welcome the raising of the age of responsibility from seven to 12 years. Much has been made of the fact over the years that it was too low and had created doubts about the system. I further welcome the fact that health boards will be empowered to establish family welfare conferences in appropriate cases in respect of children at risk who have not committed offences and children before the court for their criminal behaviour but whom the court considers may need care and protection. It is an important provision for health board officials who work closely with local authorities and the Garda as they will have a valuable input to the conference because of their local knowledge, especially in rural communities. Essentially this is a preventative measure aimed at providing services for children at risk and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is embarking on a major development programme to enable it to meet its obligations under the legislation and to address the deficiencies and weaknesses in existing facilities. The Bill also proposes a greatly expanded role for the Minister for <Col N="135" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the statutory Garda diversion programme. Discussions at health board level suggested that the legislation should include major elements of the restorative justice programme, such as the introduction of a more proactive version of restorative cautioning than heretofore with the victim in attendance, which has been welcomed by everybody who has considered the Bill; the appointment of a person who is not a member of the Garda to chair the conference, which will be an integral part of the diversion programme; and the formulation of an action plan or written contract of compliance with the plan. I recognise their importance and value.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to expand these provisions through the introduction of a court directed and supervised family conference which will be run by the Probation and Welfare Service. This is another manifestation of restorative justice which will give the courts a further alternative in progressing to a decision and a possible finding of guilt. The courts are to be given the power to impose a suitable sanction on a child offender under 16 years in cases where detention is deemed inappropriate. This will contribute towards preventing a revolving door syndrome in child detention schools. These proposals have previously been mentioned by various health board committees and Garda liaison officers. In addition, where the courts are unable to impose detention in a child detention school due to lack of space, they will, as an alternative, be empowered to impose an appropriate community sanction.</P>
    <P>The courts will also have power to impose a detention plus supervision order on children aged 16 and 17. Under it, detention and supervision in the community for a maximum of 12 months can be divided equally, thus providing greater opportunities for successful re-integration. The child detention schools will have a new, improved inspection system, which I welcome. The better the inspection system and safeguards which are built into it the greater the improvement will be. The leave arrangements from child detention schools will be expanded to include mobility trips and unaccompanied absences to gain work experience. The value of that cannot be overstated. It will be invaluable in giving children a sense of purpose and will afford them the opportunity to look forward to another way of life. The arrangements will be made more flexible so that the leave programme can be drawn up for each child detainee.</P>
    <P>A special residential services board will be established to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children on whom child detention orders have been imposed, primarily offenders, or in respect of whom special care orders have been made, primarily out of control non-offenders. I also welcome that the meaning of &ldquo;cruelty to children&rdquo; is to be expanded to <Col N="136" /> include mental or emotional ill-health or well-being.</P>
    <P>The advantages of restorative justice are well documented. It is not an easy option but it ensures that, if successful, there will not be a finding of guilt, with all that entails. The child and his or her family will be involved in arriving at an equitable solution and the offender will be made aware of the effects of his or her criminal behaviour on the victim, possibly in the presence of the victim. That is also an important provision.</P>
    <P>Section 12 updates the child protection provisions of the 1908 Act, thus allowing the Act to be repealed. An important element of this process was the acceptance of recommendations by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. I congratulate the Minister on drafting comprehensive legislation which has identified a plethora of creative solutions and options to deal with young people in trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is significant legislation, which will establish a new system of juvenile justice. When legislators last examined this issue with a view to introducing a comprehensive Bill, the Children Act, 1908, resulted. There have been many changes in thinking since. The concept of restorative justice, for example, is new. An updating of the juvenile justice system was long overdue. When one considers that 50% of crime is committed by persons under 21 years, one realises how important is the legislation.</P>
      <P>I was afraid the debate might be very legalistic and academic. However, that has not been the case and a number of Members who represent urban areas outlined the problems on the ground relating to juvenile justice. Statistics demonstrate that many young offenders come from certain areas, which are by and large disadvantaged. There are problems relating to joyriding and drugs and alcohol abuse.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of being positive in this debate, may I reply to an impression that might have been created in the Minister's contribution? I will do so without delay. When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for broadcasting, I produced a <Col N="138" /> Green Paper on Broadcasting &ndash; broadcasting in the future tense &ndash; which set out 50 questions I felt our policy would have to answer before we could introduce legislation. I later produced the heads of the legislation as approved by Government, and these were published in the document entitled Fócas Geal &ndash; Clear Focus. In that document there is a clear indication of that on which I had approval from Government. The changes that would have been made would have been of a constitutional kind or in response to representations made after the publication of the heads of legislation. It dealt with, for example, the transition from digital and it advised strongly in favour of the establishment of the Broadcasting Commission which would come into existence to take control of transmission, thereby satisfying all the European arguments about competition and fairness and, in turn, assuring fairness to any clients using the transmission system.</P>
      <P>The document also referred to the need to define public service broadcasting in a new way, a point to which I will return. Page 49, No. 5 of the English version of the document which was published, as was the Green Paper, dhá theangach, in Irish and in English, states: &ldquo;. . . to arrange for the provision and maintenance of a broadcast transmission system, or systems, commensurate with the development of relevant technologies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope what I have to say this evening will be positive but it will indicate the crisis we are now facing. I said last night, and I repeat now, that it is impossible to take a decision in relation to transmission or in relation to the division of transmission from multiplex management without it having implications for public service broadcasting. If I were in the Minister's position now I would ask myself the question: how can we ensure, as there seems to be a consensus in the House, that there will be programmes that will reflect our own cultural identity, they will be sufficiently broadly based and will be of a nature that we will be able to see ourselves in them? Perhaps it is a modern version of the famous description of broadcasting on the other island as a nation talking to itself.</P>
      <P>What is happening now will make that very difficult because if the Minister wants to revise broadcasting and make changes in the legislation already introduced, she should direct her attention to the fact that she needs to make public service broadcasting safe, even before she commercialises the transmission of multiplex management systems. I will give an example of the reason for that, and it is drawn from international experience in relation to where these changes have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of a television product or a programme is that it is a joint consumed object, by which I mean it is consumed not only where it is made but by every country to which the programme is sold. The United States, for example, which makes 75% of all programmes in English, has the advantage of having a very large English <Col N="139" /> speaking market, the second language spoken in the world. It has a massive market, therefore, it can have initial high production costs and it has very low incremental costs. With that capacity, one can invest in a high grade production with high grade production values and can afford to flog it across the world at very little incremental cost. That explains the reason there is such a complete deluge of such programmes across the television viewing spectrum.</P>
    <P>How can we make public service broadcasting safe in such an environment? We can never make it safe but there should be a massive investment in programming and the definition in the legislation should be that the public service broadcaster, the national broadcaster, is principally a programme maker. If we can do that, it would be replied to immediately by international market forces which are putting a new spin on the word &ldquo;localisation&rdquo; by which they mean taking a product that is produced, say, in a large market like the United States and allowing a kind of local packet to give it locale, in the same way as McDonalds allow their restaurants to be localised. It is an abuse of the word &ldquo;localised&rdquo; but it is an inevitable extension of the &ldquo;McDonaldisation&rdquo; of the world.</P>
    <P>I come now to my net political point. It is important that the Minister explains what she means when she says that she will defend public service broadcasting. She can best do so by ensuring programme making capacity. She will have to fund it, but how will she do that? In my last proposals to Government for an increase in the licence fee I indexed that rise and it would be more today than the net deficit in RTE. That was never revoked by Cabinet decision but the Minister said she disagrees with it and she will not implement it. That indexation would be worth what the deficit is today, but I want to move on from that.</P>
    <P>In the likelihood of there being no indexation and no rise in the licence fee, RTE then has to turn to whatever assets it has available to it. Last night I posed questions which I will not repeat because of time constraints. I presume the Minister, when replying to the debate, will give us the history of the transmission system and the legality that governs frequencies, both in international and national law. The Minister cannot sell or instruct to sell that which she does not own. This is all about scarce frequency management. The pressure of the &ldquo;McDonaldisation&rdquo; of broadcasting is to suggest that we will have an open season once we have abolished regulation and scarcity in frequencies.</P>
    <P>There is another question I have not time to go into but it indicates the hand of those who are interested in multiplex management purchase, that is, are they going for digitalisation to improve picture quality, for example, such as high definition television? Will they improve the image? That is very interesting. The telephone companies did not go for improving the quality <Col N="140" /> of what one hears on a telephone. They went for more and more people, with reduced quality, listening to mobile telephones. In exactly the same way this issue is about acquiring more space to lash out more product, and all this is about programming.</P>
    <P>The Minister also promised in her legislation that she would deal with the issue of cross-ownership. In my legislation, in a Private Members' Bill, I proposed to deal with Article 3A of the Amsterdam Treaty in relation to sporting rights. My amendment to the Competition Act put a limit on cross-ownership. There is nothing in the Broadcasting Bill which will deal with the issue of cross-ownership, and there is nothing to stop those with a dominant position or those who are abusing a dominant position in one medium straying into another.</P>
    <P>What does all this tell us? It tells us something about my own departure from the Department where, rather vindictively, the Taoiseach and the Government decided to delete the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from the title of the Department &ndash; it was the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. With the disappearance of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; came an insistence on the &ldquo;commodification&rdquo; of everything, and the distinction between my appointments and my attitudes and policies in the Department and that of my successors was the arrival of commercial thinking, solely unmitigated.</P>
    <P>We must accept that broadcasting is a cultural matter not amenable to sole regulation by market principles. We require a Minister with responsibility for broadcasting to be able to tell the colleague who is handling technical infrastructure that matters technical are matters technical, but matters about national identity and broadcasting&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important that the Minister also answers another question. If she decides to leave aside cultural arguments and to, as she put it in a television interview, sell the transmission system to the highest bidder, as the Minister was reported as saying &ndash; she has had an opportunity to check it &ndash; has the Minister in the interest of fair competition, satisfied herself that the licence granted by her colleague, which neatly allows her a return line to a telecommunications company, will not be an advantage in the tendering or bidding process? Is it not all, in the end, a surrender to her colleague in telecommunications in a small way and to the market in a large way? The losers will be those who want broadcasting diversity in the future.</P>

It is a great pity that Deputy Higgins, in an otherwise excellent contribution, left hanging in the air last night, a suggestion or insinuation that this side of the House is less than committed to the public service broadcasting ethos. It was extremely disingenuous of him to imply that previous Ministers with responsibility for communications had another agenda. This side of the House and the Minister are as committed to public service broadcasting as anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving towards an era where digital broadcasting will fast become the norm throughout Europe. The advent of digital broadcasting opens up exciting new possibilities for the number, range and diversity of services that may be accessed <i>via</i> the traditional television broadcasting platforms. Convergence in broadcasting, information and communication technologies is already impacting on many aspects of our society. As new and additional services come on stream, access to digital television will increasingly influence the ability of the citizen to participate in the information society. The Government remains committed to the objective that all society should have access to the opportunities afforded by digital broadcasting and reaffirms its commitment to the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland as a practical step towards the realisation of this objective.</P>
      <P>Digital television is perhaps the fastest growing sector of the European media and entertainment market. As almost every household in Ireland has a television, it is predicted that the advent of digital television will result in considerable market opportunities for the development of interactive television and e-commerce services. While not favouring any one delivery platform, the development of a digital terrestrial television platform will represent an important strategic step in the evolution of a comprehensive range of digital broadcasting delivery systems in Ireland. It is likely that the digital terrestrial television platform will be the only digital platform that will provide universal access to the national free to air services. It is to be expected that this platform will also carry the UK terrestrial services and will, therefore, contribute to competition between the different delivery platforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed that the tone of much of the recent media speculation in relation to the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland has been so negative. If we consider the facts, there is justification for being upbeat. Digital terrestrial television is a new technology and we are to the fore amongst our European partners in the development and adoption of this <Col N="142" /> technology. Ireland has a record of which we should be proud in the development and adoption of new technologies. This has not occurred by accident but as a result of the consistent and ongoing commitment of successive Governments of all parties to develop the information technology sector. As a consequence, Ireland is now well positioned to become a global leader in the e-commerce market.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we should be complacent in how we advance the process to introduce digital terrestrial television in Ireland. However, our track record in developing and adopting new technologies speaks for itself. When one considers the commitment of the Government to the establishment of the digital terrestrial platform and the investment of time and effort by the Minister and the various interested parties in exploring and pursuing the best way forward, there is good reason for optimism that this project will move forward in a positive and successful fashion.</P>
    <P>Putting in place a framework to facilitate the establishment of a digital terrestrial television entity and the introduction of digital terrestrial television to Ireland is a significant and complex task. Considerable progress has already been made in advancing the critical elements of that framework. The Broadcasting Bill, which will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, the legislative framework for the establishment of the digital terrestrial television entity and the introduction of digital terrestrial television, has passed Second Stage in this House. The office of the Director of Telecommunications has published a consultation paper on the licensing of digital terrestrial television. Much of the work to prepare an information memorandum to be issued to potential investors in the digital terrestrial television platform has been completed.</P>
    <P>The development of a satisfactory transaction structure to bring the digital terrestrial television entity into being is one element of the necessary framework to facilitate the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland. The Minister has placed on record that the development of a satisfactory transaction structure has proved to be a difficult and complex task. The difficulties that have arisen do not signal a change of heart by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be very rude at times. The advice was that the transaction should be progressed on the basis of a predetermined value of the RTE transmission business, based on a prudent investor approach. The Minister also referred to the opposition of the RTE Authority to such an approach and to the view of the Authority that the value of its transmission business should be determined by the marketplace.</P>

      <P>The Deputies are like a Greek chorus. I support the Minister in her contention that there is a strong argument in favour of allowing RTE to expose its transmission business to the market. Such a course would only be justifiable, however, if the manner in which RTE's transmission business was exposed to the market did not impact negatively on the likely success of the project as a whole.</P>
      <P>With all the recent media speculation on the subject, it would be easy to understand how those not involved in the process could be led to believe the Minister and the Government had made some dramatic change in policy. It is important to dispel such myths. The Minister has not put any new proposals on broadcasting to Government, as she said last night, and there has been no change in Government policy with regard to the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The approach being adopted by the Minister is the right approach and is the one most likely to result in the project moving forward on a successful basis. On the crucial issue of how the transaction is to be structured, the Minister has consulted widely with the interested parties and continues to do so. The Minister is to be admired for her resolve in conducting this consultation process in a proper way and not allowing the ongoing public, and sometimes mischievous, speculation in the media to detract her from this important task. If and when the Minister decides it is necessary to bring proposals to Government to progress the matter further, she will do so.

At the Cabinet table and elsewhere she has emphasised that there is now a stronger need than ever for public service broadcasting, providing programmes of quality and catering for all interests. The Broadcasting Bill formulated by the Government and before this House, strengthens RTE's position as the national public broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>On the provision of DTT, let us be clear about a few issues. RTE lobbied and were satisfied with what was provided for in the Bill. In brief a project management group with representatives from various Departments and RTE was formed to establish a company called Digico in which RTE would have a stake of 40% or less. Procedures were agreed on how this would be achieved, but when it became apparent that the outcome was not what RTE had expected, their reaction was to express difficulties which delayed the process.</P>

      <P>Is he saying that the BBC which was forced to sell its transmission network in 1996 is influenced in some way regarding programme content? That claim is complete nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument put forward by a few is that universal availability can only be achieved by a State broadcaster owning the transmission network. Again, this is completely wrong. Universal availability is achieved through licensing and regulation. All of this scaremongering has led to a certain amount of confusion among RTE staff. It was clear when the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera met staff representatives last week that they did not have the full information. It was for this reason that the Minister engaged the excellent services of Mr. Phil Flynn as a facilitator. His task will be, &ldquo;To promote a common understanding amongst RTE, the RTE Trade Union Group and the RTE network employees likely to transfer to the new DTT entity&rdquo;. The terms of reference state that, <Col N="148" />&ldquo;The task will not include negotiating the position of the Minister with any of the parties&rdquo;. This is the Minister's hands-off approach.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the Broadcasting Bill over the past month there appeared to be an impression in some quarters that Digico, if it went ahead as originally planned, would have provided a guaranteed income-stream for RTE. Yet again, this is incorrect. Digico would have had considerable investment over the next decade or more and it was by no means certain if and when the company would have been in a position to pay dividends.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has made it clear in Opposition and in Government that each application by RTE for an increase in the cost of the television licence would be considered on it merits. Since our election to the Government almost three years ago, no application has been received by the Minister from RTE. Earlier this year the Minister made it quite clear that Irish television households, who this year are expected to contribute £67 million in licence fee revenue to RTE must be constantly reassured that this revenue is well spent.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that neither the Government nor Deputy Síle de Valera have changed their policy on the introduction of DTT. The Minister is considering changes to the structure of developing the digital platform because of RTE's approach. The delays are not due to the Minister nor the Government. Her priority and the priority of her Cabinet colleagues, including me, is the early roll-out of DTT. We want to get on with the job.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The RTE authority has taken a particular stand with regard to the method of the sale of the transmission network. The advice available to the Minister is that it is not possible to develop an appropriate transaction structure that would satisfy the authority's position of exposing the transmission network to the marketplace within the confines of the existing Government decision on the introduction of DTT. If the wishes of the RTE authority in this regard are to be satisfied it would be necessary for the Minister to contemplate changes to the structures of the DTT entity as envisaged in the original Government decision. This is a matter of detail rather than of principle. It is not a reversal of policy and neither is it a reason to withdraw the Broadcasting Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>If changes are made to the detail of the transaction process it will be necessary to bring forward amendments to the Bill. Any changes to the Bill or to the detail of the policy context in which the Bill was drafted, will be dealt with in the House in an appropriate way at an appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The object of this particular exercise is to establish a platform which will, as far as possible, provide universal access at reasonable <Col N="151" /> rates to digital television and to the other benefits of the information society that the DTT platform will be capable of delivering.</P>
      <P>The possible separation of the component activities of the DTT entity as originally envisaged, does not change this fundamental objective. The transmission of broadcast services in digital form will be licensed and regulated from a technical point of view by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, as is provided for in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, and as is currently the case in respect of analogue broadcasting.</P>
      <P>There is no question, as some media reports would have us believe, of simply handing over the operation and control of transmission to the highest bidder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always the intention that broadcasting transmission would be a regulated function with obligations regarding coverage and charges for provision of facilities. The Broadcasting Bill provides for this. The ODTR has confirmed that it intends to impose onerous obligations on the transmission entity. In addition, as the Broadcasting Bill provides that the transmission company will be obliged to carry the services of RTE, TG4 and TV3 in analogue and digital form, there will be no opportunities to prevent or restrict access to our indigenous television channels.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the BBC was required to sell off its transmission network in 1996. I have not noticed that the fabric of society in Britain has changed since then. BSkyB, for all the concerns expressed about its activities, has managed to achieve its position of strength without ownership either of the satellite system on which it transmits, or the cable television system on which it is distributed. While I have no doubt that Mr. Murdoch and his colleagues at BSkyB would like to control delivery platforms if they could, they kept their sights firmly on the main prize &ndash; programme content.</P>
      <P>The important issue is that Irish viewers have access to the creative output of our programme makers and broadcasting in digital form, and that they continue to have access to our television stations in analogue form until digital becomes the norm for everyone, regardless of economic circumstances. The Minister's proposals in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, have these objectives. The fundamental principles have not changed. The Minister has developed a comprehensive policy on broadcasting and has put in place a mechanism for delivering on all aspects of this policy.</P>
      <P>While it is the job of the Opposition to oppose, there should be more to this than the cynical knocking that it has engaged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the amendment which welcomes the Government <Col N="152" /> decision to arrange for the establishment of a digital terrestrial television platform. I welcome also the Minister's decision to appoint a facilitator. She made reference to the appropriate structures that take the position of all interested parties into account. We have heard much talk about RTE being under threat and in a state of uncertainty. That would be a retrograde step for RTE and TG4. In visits I have made to RTE, I have been impressed by the work in progress and the planning of programmes. There is an excellent RTE website and first class music and education programmes.</P>
      <P>From having spoken to people involved in local radio I know that they, too, feel under threat. Local radio has been very successful. As we speak, the official launch of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland is taking place. It is the first time that independent broadcasters in radio and television are being officially represented nationally. They are proud that the very positive JNLR figures show that independent radio is the number one choice of listeners.</P>
      <P>Those involved in local radio often say there is little mention of their future. They are at the cutting edge of technology and they were quick to use the Internet. Not only do they provide local news and information but they are also prepared to move their broadcasting equipment to London, New York and Boston to broadcast programmes which are of local interest in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On Galway Bay radio, the Keith Finnegan programme which is broadcast between 10 a.m. and 12 noon each morning, is repeated at 12 midnight. Maybe it is a time slot, as Deputy Rabbitte once said, for drunks and insomniacs. However, I am sometimes returning from meetings at that time of night or early morning and I can hear the morning's programme repeated. I also note that RTE, in the &ldquo;Irish Collection&rdquo;, has repeat programmes in the early morning. Local radio stations do not receive as much assistance as they should. They also face the prospect of having to renew their licences.</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to removing the 3% levy and I welcome the fact that she has promised a fund of £500,000 to help local infrastructure. The continued commitment of the Government to ensuring the successful introduction of digital terrestrial television is to be welcomed also. While Ireland is further advanced than most EU countries in the steps it has taken to establish a DTT platform, I recognise that the window of opportunity for the introduction of DTT will be influenced by factors outside this process. I welcome, therefore, the manner in which the Minister has approached the complex task of developing a satisfactory transition structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than engaging through the media in a public debate on many non-issues the Minister has instead consulted widely with her Cabinet colleagues, the RTE authority and management, the RTE trade union group and with representatives of those people likely to transfer to the new DTT entity. It is incredible that the Minister <Col N="153" /> should be criticised for acting in a responsible manner by consulting with all the interested parties and taking every necessary measure to ensure that the policy objective for the successful introduction of DTT is achieved.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister should be criticised in the debate both for doing deals behind people's backs and for consulting widely. A lack of consistency has been evident from the Opposition's contributions. Deputy Kenny gave us the TV3 line in November 1999&mdash;</P>

      <P>Conversions of technologies will mean that new services, other than traditional broadcasting services, will be available on the digital television platforms. Participation in the information society for many homes that do not own a PC will be via the digital television platforms. Due to its capacity for universal coverage the successful establishment of the DTT platform will open new possibilities to those who to date <Col N="154" /> have been excluded from the information society. Media speculation on how the transaction to establish the DTT entity is to be structured has done nothing to advance the process and some of the speculation has been misleading and very unhelpful. I am confident the Minister's course of action will result in this project moving forward and I congratulate her on the manner in which she has handled this complex and sensitive issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by the Government U-turn on this issue. We were told for years that the Government would protect RTE. I have never been a great lover of RTE, I have always preferred local radio and have always felt that RTE should have had programmes doing what local radio and television are doing. It is now too late and this power will be taken out of their hands because in future local radio stations will also be licensed to broadcast television programmes.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Government made this decision as it is important that our national station is strong and broadcasts national culture. After the recent death of actor Tony Doyle there was a repeat of &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo;. We do not see enough Irish programmes like this. Who is behind the Government plan to sell off station equipment in order to set up this company? The Government was determined that this would not happen. What are the influences behind the scenes and why did the Government change its mind? There were a lot of shenanigans in relation to local radio licences and some of those matters are being investigated by tribunals.</P>
      <P>I am bitterly disappointed that RTE is being attacked in this way. RTE staff feel insecure. They do not know what the future holds and they want to know how RTE is to be funded, as there is no leadership. The Government has fought with RTE, the nurses, the gardaí, the farmers and the bus men, yet we see opinion polls that state the Government is doing well. Those carrying out the polls are going to Fianna Fáil supporters; they are certainly not going to the general public.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kitt said, some Members met a delegation tonight from local radio stations all over the country. I hope we will see local television in the future, as local radio stations have been a great success. They have brought communities together and given them an opportunity to voice their opinions. I compliment Paul Claffey and Mid-West Radio, as that station is doing wonderful work in Mayo. Some people have criticised me for being on it too often, but I do not mind. At least one can get one's message across whether one is a member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. I hope the Government gives those stations some of the licence fee revenue as they are entitled to spend it on home-based programmes and outside broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand what is happening. Those <Col N="155" /> in RTE are confused, as is the Government. I compliment Deputy Kenny on tabling this motion. The Government will have to make up its mind regarding its public broadcasting policy. What outside influence has made the Government change its mind? The Minister went to California to find investors for the Irish film industry, but another signal was being sent to RTE. Private operators could raise money, but RTE could not. The Minister is saying she does not know what she is going to do with RTE. Maybe she will get rid of RTE or maybe she will freeze it out by not giving it the necessary money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I direct the Minister's attention towards the future of local radio. On one hand the Minister seems to be acknowledging the contribution of local radio and praising it while on the other she is doing little to secure its future. I am concerned that local radio will not be able to play on the new digital pitch, given the new digital arrangements that are proposed. I hope the Minister will guarantee a role, function and future for local radio in the digital age.</P>
      <P>I am concerned by a recent comment of Mr. Conor Maguire of the Independent Radio and Television Commission who said that he would be in a position to distribute further regional licences in the near future and that there may also be a reallocation or redistribution of licences within the local franchise area. This raises a serious question mark about the future of local radio. Most local radio stations have been highly successful and have played an important role in communities, particularly in rural regions outside the Dublin and Cork areas. I am concerned that Government policies might act as disincentives to the future flourishing of local radio and I am also concerned by the lack of consultation between local radio and the Independent Radio and Television Commission and between local radio and the Minister.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister envisage local radio participating in the digital framework that has been outlined? Unless she is prepared to underpin the future of local radio, many stations will go to the wall, there is no doubt about that. The current local radio structure cannot exist in or compete with the digital framework that will come in. The JNLR survey of August 1999 shows the local independent radio market share to be 51% while RTE's share is 49%. I remind the Minister that there are more than 900 people in employment in the 21 local radio stations.</P>
      <P>The existing radio licences will expire in just over two years. What will happen to the huge investment in those stations? The marriage of local radio and digital technology is vital if local radio is to survive into the new millennium. I hope the Minister is more positive about the future of local radio, otherwise we will have done a huge disservice to communities all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned by Fianna Fáil's approach to broadcasting. For example, in 1994 the community television service throughout rural Ireland used to cost in the region of £30 to £40 but the then Government sold off that service to Irish Multi-Channel or Horizon and the service now costs £210.84 per annum. That service should not have been sold off and we, on this side of the House, did everything possible to prevent that happening.</P>
      <P>It is very important that a large section of the television transmission service remains in public ownership and that the Department, the Government and RTE have a say in that service. The people who control the transmission system will control what is broadcast on television and radio. The Minister stated that she is considering allowing the transmission business to be exposed to the market. Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> clearly indicates the intention to sell off 100% of the transmission system. If the system is to be sold to the highest bidder, what is to prevent Rupert Murdoch or some such person taking complete control of the system? I am very concerned about this issue. If the system were to be sold to the highest bidder, our broadcasting service provider, RTE, which has done excellent work over the years, would be in great danger. Given the tradition of the Fianna Fáil Party, I was very surprised to see what happened in regard to community television and I am equally surprised that it now appears the transmission system is to be sold to the highest bidder. It will be a sad day for this country if that happens. I urge the Minister to act with caution. She should redraft the broadcasting legislation and return to this House with a more considered Bill. Some 300 jobs will be lost in RTE if the transmission service is sold.</P>
      <P>The community radio sector is doing an excellent job but it feels its back is to the wall at present. The sector does not feel it is receiving the Government support to which it feels it is entitled. In my own area, we have Midlands Radio 3, Shannonside, Tipp FM and so on. All these stations are doing an excellent job in difficult circumstances. The Minister must take their concerns on board. Apparently, the Minister feels that this is the right time to sell the transmission system. I would be opposed to that and I urge the Minister to prevent that happening.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Bill on Second Stage so I intend to be brief. In her contribution last night, the Minister alleged that members of the Opposition were being heavily influenced by TV3 and the lobbying it carried out. I am aware that the departmental officials probably draft the Minister's speech. I referred to TV3 during the debate on the Broadcasting Bill but I only received one document from the station about which I raised some questions during my Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unfair to accuse Deputies of taking a particular line. Our responsibility during the <Col N="157" /> Second Stage debate is to highlight the issues which are raised by interest groups. We are entitled to express our individual views on the legislation and, doubtless, our spokesperson will articulate the party line. The Minister's contribution last night reflected the total confusion and lack of policy direction in her Department on the broadcasting issue. The goalposts change from week to week.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening, I attended a presentation by Independent Broadcasters in the Shelbourne Hotel and the predominant view was that the entire broadcasting issue is in disarray, that there is a high degree of confusion, that the national broadcaster is totally demoralised and that we are currently in a state of upheaval and flux. The Minister's advisers seem to be adding to this malaise of confusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister clarified that digital audio broadcasting does not form part of the Bill's content although the people involved in local and community radio were convinced that it did. Does that reflect a lack of communication on the Minister's part with the local radio sector? I received a letter from Mr. Paul Sheehan, General Manager of Kerry Radio. That station, which is very well run, has one of the highest listenerships in the country. I am aware that the Minister clarified this issue to some extent last night but I want to refer to some of the points made in the letter. The letter states:</P>
    <P>The key issue in the Broadcasting Bill pertaining to radio concerns licence renewal. All 21 local radio stations have been granted licences which will expire in 2003 or 2004. At that point, each station will have to re-apply, along with other interested parties. This will seriously complicate the transition of radio to digital. This transition to digital will require considerable investment by local radio in digital technology. Such an investment will require funding but no investor is going to risk capital on a station that may not exist in three years' time. To tackle this issue, Radio Kerry, along with other stations within Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, is proposing that the Broadcasting Bill be amended to include the following . . . that all existing licence holders should have their licences automatically renewed for a period of ten years with a number of safeguards.</P>
    <P>If the Minister plans to introduce a digital audio broadcasting policy, she should allay the fears of local radio stations and extend the licences at this stage. Obviously, digital audio broadcasting will come into effect in the not too distant future. The Minister should reconsider her intention to reject Deputy Kenny's proposal. If she does not intend to take Deputy Kenny's advice, surely the best way to proceed would be to issue a memorandum to ascertain the level of interest which exists and to find out from the interested parties what direction should be taken. We do not have any clear direction at this stage in regard to this very com<Col N="158" /> plex area of legislation. There are many experts but none of them appear to have a solution, if there is one. However, it is important that we draw on the ideas of international interests as to how it should be done. It is also important that Internet services be provided through digital television. Some 98% of the population have televisions and it is desirable that we transmit as much information as possible through that medium. It is important that the Minister proceeds properly and consults with potential bidders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for tabling this important motion. I attended the launch today in the Shelbourne Hotel of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, which has been formed by local radio stations and TV3. I appeal to the Minister to consult with this group because local radio stations provide an invaluable service and are part of the broadcasting fabric of this country. It is important that they are consulted on changes in broadcasting. Local radio was established ten years ago, it has a huge listenership and must be consulted as a source of funding.</P>
      <P>I am not an expert on broadcasting but I know about terrestrial television and interactive services from reading the newspapers. Last month, the Minister caused a sensation by circulating a document to her Cabinet colleagues in which she suggested that RTE be excluded from retaining an interest in its transmission system when sold by public auction. Broadcasting is big business. We see how mobile 'phone licences became so valuable due to the growth in telecommunications. The Minister initially proposed that RTE would control up to 40% of the new commercial entity, Digico, in return for its transmission system. Even more surprising was the suggestion that this crucial change in Government policy would be dealt with by Committee Stage amendments to the Broadcasting Bill, which is before the House. If the Minister is determined to engage in such a fundamental policy shift, the least the public should expect is a clear statement of her intentions and the reasons for the change.</P>
      <P>To date, the Minister has said the difficulties arise because of the advice received on the establishment of Digico from a financial consortium led by the AIB Finance Corporation. It is hard to put a value on our transmission system. It was understood that the financial consortium valued the transmission network at £30 million to £40 million, rather than £60 million to £70 million as envisaged by RTE. It resisted what it regarded as the bargain basement sale of a prime asset. A national television station without a transmission system is like a football pitch without goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public debate is essential to democracy and when control of the State airwaves is involved, it takes on an added significance. The Minister is responsible for ensuring that use of the airwaves contributes to the public good. This may or may <Col N="159" /> not require RTE retaining an interest in the transmission system but issues should be fully ventilated in public before legislation is brought before the Dáil. Otherwise, those who suspect unethical commercial dealings will be provided with ammunition. We have seen the creation of multi-millionaires because of technology and I am certain that they will also be created because of changes in broadcasting. Decisions taken by the Minister will have far-reaching implications.</P>
    <P>The method designed to facilitate a change in policy is also unacceptable. The Broadcasting Bill was introduced in the Oireachtas last year and was debated extensively before receiving a Second Stage reading, on the clear understanding that up to 40% of Digico would be owned by RTE. The Minister now appears determined to enforce a complete sale. This is a major shift in policy and will result in RTE's shareholding being reduced from 40% to zero. Such a fundamental shift should not be dealt with by a series of amendments. If the Minister is determined to pursue this new course of action, she should withdraw the legislation before the Dáil and introduce a new Bill. The issues could then be fully debated and reasons for the change in policy given to the public.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputies Kenny and Donal Carey on their astute reading of this legislation. It is the most important legislation to come before the Dáil in 30 years and has far-reaching implications for business. It involves the development of the digitalisation of television which will result in huge changes as we reach European and American standards. We have a responsibility to obtain the maximum return on State investment in the national airwaves, especially RTE. Many jobs are at risk and we must reassure people that our transmission system is not being sold at a bargain basement price. Local radio stations have no resources and are crying out for funding. Part of the profits from selling the transmission system should be reinvested in local radio stations who provide an invaluable service.</P>
    <P>The sole source of income for independent broadcasters is advertising. Local independent radio is almost ten years old and in recent years it has become economically viable. It does not receive any of the licence fee, which is also a bone of contention. This matter has far-reaching implications and Deputy Kenny referred to the problems involved. We have a duty to those who elected us to voice their concerns. Decisions should be made transparently and Members should be entitled to ask questions on their constituents' behalf. With the economy doing so well, we must not be left short. The sum of £70 million may seem like a great deal of money but it is not when the Government can invest hundreds of millions. It is hard to put a price on a national asset. Given that we are being advised by AIB Finance Corporation which was uncertain of the valuation, there needs to be an independent <Col N="160" /> assessment of the sale of the transmission network.</P>
    <P>A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> stated the Government would exclude RTE from a joint venture company which will build the State's new digital television network. This matter must be clarified. I am also concerned that Ms Doyle, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, stated that the delays will not cause any damage. However, we have delayed on the matter for quite a while and it is a pity that the Minister's proposals regarding the sale of RTE were not discussed in the House before this. Digital television is the best way to provide universal coverage in the Republic. We must remember that many people living in certain parts of the country and who pay licence fees cannot receive RTE 1. Sky News' digital system is up and running.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Kenny for giving me an opportunity to speak on this important issue and for introducing it in Private Members' time. It is an important issue which will have far-reaching implications. I hope the Minister will consider Deputies' detailed statements and proposals to change the many problems which will emerge in this issue.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be able to clarify some of the issues raised. The old saying comes to mind &ndash; there are none so blind as those who will not see. That is certainly true in this case. Some of what I have heard has surprised me coming from people whom I normally respect.</P>
      <P>Originally a proposal could not have been brought to Government in the form now being contemplated because RTE's difficulties were not apparent at that time. It is crazy when matters change over time that we cannot change with them. We always talk about moving forward. If circumstances change, must we live in a time warp and not deal with issues as they unfold? In this case the issue unfolded for RTE and the Government would be wrong not to change accordingly. The scaremongering about handing over the transmission system to a private entity is nonsense. The people objecting to this have no problem with a regulator ensuring public access to the telecommunications system. No one seems to have a problem with this because they know the regulator can insist on absolute universal access. We can now do by way of regulation what we previously had to do by way of ownership, therefore we should stop scaremongering. Having listened to the debate, I wonder how the telecommunications companies work because they do not own the transmission system. To get through to a call centre, one must go through the transmission system. The same principle is involved here. Let us not run away on some high flying principles when there are no principles involved. We can absolutely copperfasten that these transmission systems will be available universally to the people to whom they should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> On digital radio broadcasting, this is an extraordinary situation. On the one hand, Deputy after Deputy spoke about giving away the national broadcasting franchise while, on the other, they spoke about local radio.

It is about time Deputies told IBI which side of the fence they are on because they have a huge problem with this proposal.</P>

The innuendos about some backroom dealing with financial institutions is incredible. Whatever may be said about a decision made by the Minister and me in our respective roles in the Department &ndash; I work with the Minister on a daily basis and I am related to her &ndash; no one is more interested than she is in the national good. We may all see the national good in a slightly different way but no one is less likely than the Minister to be influenced by personal gain.

Therefore, it came as a great shock to all of us to hear her on television on her way to Los Angeles saying that the entire transmission system would be sold. This was contrary to what we thought was proposed in the Bill. The Minister was telling us for three years that she agreed with RTE's concept. She said last night that RTE came up with the figure of 40%. She continued to speak in very puzzling and diverse tongues about the issues. As chairman of the committee, I have listened to all sides of the argument and the Minister has not explained to me or to the public exactly what the problems are. There is no transparency or understanding.</P>

      <P>I will try heckling because the Minister told a blatant untruth last night about our campaigning to have 400 people made redundant from RTE. I had to respond to that because it was going a bit too far. We gave the Minister every chance last night to answer our queries and she did not take it. She pretends to understand the problems about broadcasting, the new era, digital, the legislation and the different technical problems that exist. I listened to all sides of the argument for two and a half years and found it difficult to understand, even though I do not think I am dense. I thought the Minister would have said we would deal with the issue together because no one wishes to get rid of RTE. No one wishes to privatise RTE, unless it is the Minister's intention to do so and sell the shares. The question of shareholding, who will be involved in the framework and whether the technical staff or the unions and management will run RTE has been doing the rounds since the Minister intervened on the transmission issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not like to hear the Minister announce she would give an open-ended consultancy to AIB until the matter is resolved. AIB has fallen down in this matter and does not deserve this consultancy. It is obvious it did not even look at EU legislation on the matter. Had it done so it would be apparent to us all when this sudden problem arose. If it did not know how to handle these things why did it take the job? What monitoring took place on the competence of AIB to do this job? That is not apparent. Is there not a problem with European legislation and the Minister's lack of consultation? If there is a difficulty why did not the Minister say there was a problem on the European side and that she did not deal with it? The Government believed it would be able to roll out of this problem less tarnished than the others because the Fine Gael Party does not understand anything and the Labour Party has an ideological hang up. One can pin those tags on children at school. Those who have invested in <Col N="163" /> this industry are not amused. As my colleagues said last night those in the independent radio side and in TV3 are not amused.</P>

I am sorry the Government parties felt it incumbent on them to treat it in a flippant, arrogant and grossly untruthful manner. I am surprised at Ministers and Minister of State who came in and read prepared scripts from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, without an understanding of the matter, in the knowledge that what they were reading was new to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred last night to scurrilous remarks and a new low by Deputy Kenny in respect of his comments about 400 redundancies. At the hearing of the committee on 30 November 1999 in response to a question from me, following the RTE review of operations in the summer of 1998, it was indicated that 300 redundancies would achieve a core saving of £10 million, that 400 redundancies would achieve a saving of over £13 million and that the director general said it needed a saving of £15 million over three years. The scriptwriters did not do themselves or the Minister justice. It is beneath the Minister to involve herself in that kind of activity.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to belittling the House. Through her activities, comments and incommunicado position in Los Angeles the Minister belittled the Oireachtas, the committee and the members of her party who serve on that committee by leaking a story to Independent newspapers with a vested interest in Princes Holdings. She informed us that 70% of the story was true without confirming which 30% was false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took 30 minutes last night to say very little. Leaving aside some snide comments and a forced attempt at humour she told us only that the Bill was flawed and that after a year or more the working party involved had convinced her of this. While she said the policy had not changed she admitted RTE is no longer seeking a strategic partner for DTT and will be compelled to sell its transmission assets. I would regard a switch from partnership to privatisation as a major change in policy, as do RTE and its employees. The Minister deplores the delays which she said are not the fault of the Government but failed to say who caused them, or why, in her comments about digital dithering. She advised Deputy Carey to look up the dictionary, but if she were to look it up she would find that digital dithering is an actual technique in the conversion of analogue to digital. She deplored recent media comment and speculation without <Col N="165" /> providing clarity on her policy or plans. She has not told the House whether the transmission system will be brought to the market. She has ensured speculation will continue unabated and with it the anger and unhappiness of RTE. She would have us believe in one breath that RTE is a confident and competent organisation valiantly fighting to protect its role and in the next breath that she has been forced to employ and appoint a facilitator to Montrose to explain her policies and Government objectives to RTE staff and management.</P>

      <P>We have had the same bewildering experience as the RTE management and workers groups. The Minister met them and failed to explain to them what she means. She called in Mr. Philip Flynn, as facilitator, to do her job. She did not tell us the problem issues. Neither did she say why the exercise was necessary. If she is unable to explain her policies to her own people, having met everybody involved, that speaks for itself of her ability to do the job she has been commissioned to do by the Taoiseach.</P>

Would she be prepared to allow the facilitator to come before the committee of which Deputy Carey is chairman, in private or in <Col N="166" /> public, to explain it? The extent of her direction and action in this matter has been abysmal. She established a group management project in 1999, which has been a year in existence and has only recently discovered that State aid is a problem.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - ICTU Employment Survey.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of a new ICTU survey which show high levels of employment among school goers vindicates something which we have all known or at least suspected for some time. In a substantial national survey sample of fifth and sixth year students it was found that 49% were engaged in paid employment. While I am not opposed to the employment of students, I am extremely concerned that many of the students surveyed were working late into the night and that their employers were neglecting their responsibilities under employment legislation.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that 50% of students engaged in employment did not receive a pay slip despite the fact that employers have an obligation to supply one under the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994. It also revealed that only 13% of working students received a copy of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, when they commenced employment despite employers being legally obliged to provide them with a copy. While I have previously expressed my concerns about this issue on the Adjournment, I suspect that the situation has worsened recently. I hope the Minister's response will be more encouraging on this occasion.</P>
      <P>In a bid by businesses to cash in on the biggest ever consumer spend recorded in the economy many employers are recruiting young people to work at night and at weekends without having due regard to their legal responsibilities. Walk into any public house, takeaway or late night supermarket and it is evident that a substantial number of employees are of school going age. Few of these workers are aware that they should not be in the workplace after 10 p.m. and they should be armed with a copy of the legislation covering their working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of long working hours and late <Col N="169" /> night work on students has been well documented by teachers and youth workers. The practice of young people turning up for class one or two hours late or sometimes not at all because they were working on the previous night is far too common an occurrence in Irish schools. While part-time work can give young people a sense of independence and status, the reality is that their ability to perform in examinations can be affected adversely. This is vindicated by the ICTU survey which shows that the lowest rate of participation in after school work occurs among repeat leaving certificate students, who discovered, much to their cost, that work interfered with the outcome of their examination results.</P>
    <P>Work experience can be extremely beneficial. Work experience in transition year, weekend work and summer jobs are all important in preparing school students for adult life and giving them soma e measure of financial independence. Limited suitable employment, which is carried out during these times and which will not interfere with their education, should be encouraged and supported.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, was introduced to regulate the working conditions of young people. It restricts night-time work to before 8 p.m. for people aged 14 to 15. Those aged 16 to 17 cannot work beyond 10 p.m. The Act also provides for regular rest periods for workers under 18. Each employer of young people must display a summary of the Act in the workplace and furnish young employees with a copy of it. The ICTU survey shows that these obligations in the Act are being flouted on a widespread basis and there is a clear case for the Minister to sit up and take action.</P>
    <P>Random workplace inspections are one of the most effective means of uncovering unscrupulous employers. However, at present there is limited capacity for inspectors to focus on breaches of the Act because their workload is excessive and they can only act on urgent cases which are brought to their attention. Despite a small increase in the number of inspectors in recent times, the workload will increase further with the introduction of the minimum wage legislation in the coming weeks. Furthermore, given that the inspectorate generally operates only within normal working hours and most breaches of the Act take place at night, there is no proper mechanism for detecting negligent employers.</P>
    <P>Students should be made aware of the provisions in the Act in their schools and they should be encouraged to report breaches of the Act to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The onus is not on the young people but on the State agencies to ensure that employers abide by the law in this regard and that the State agencies and, particularly, the Department, play an active role in doing what the legislation was supposed to do, that is, protecting young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, came into operation on 2 January 1997. <Col N="170" /> The Act is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person's education at risk.</P>
      <P>When the Act came into operation, details of the legislation were sent to all post-primary schools, the relevant trade unions and employer bodies, the main supermarket chains, petrol stations, hotels, restaurants and vintners associations, fast-food chains and youth organisations. Those details were also sent to third level institutions as well as education officers in the relevant student unions last year.</P>
      <P>The Act sets minimum age limits for the employment of children, that is, persons under the age of 16, and young persons, that is 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours, and prohibits the employment of those under age 18 on late night work, as Deputy Shortall stated. Employers must keep specified records of their workers who are under 18 years.</P>
      <P>Breaches of the Act may come to the attention of my Department, either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. Inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing employment legislation generally, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. The current designated strength of the inspectorate is ten inspectors. However, in the context of the introduction next month of the national minimum wage, the Government has approved the allocation of an additional seven inspectors to the inspectorate. The selection process to appoint these additional inspectors was completed in early March and formal appointments resulting from that process will be made at an early date. All members of the inspectorate will be engaged in implementing not only the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, but the full range of employment legislation generally and the National Minimum Wage Bill, 1999, on its enactment.</P>
      <P>In 1999, a total of 1,114 inspections for conformity with the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, were carried out, of which 124 were conducted in the course of a night-time campaign in late 1999, targeted exclusively on enforcement of the Act in the pub, hotel and catering sectors in Dublin and Cork. Arising from that inspection work, 14 cases are at present under preparation for referral to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for the institution of legal proceedings against employers found to have been in breach of the Act. There have been two successful prosecutions in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation, the matter is referred to my legal advisers to consider whether legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer concerned in respect of the alleged breach of the Act. Certain offences may be prosecuted by the trade union of which the employee is a member. A person found guilty of an offence <Col N="171" /> is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500 and a further £250 a day for a continuing offence.</P>
    <P>It is also open to the parent or guardian of a child or a young person to present a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has contravened section 13, which relates to preservation of existing rates of pay and conditions, or section 17, which relates to refusal to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act. For example, if an employee refuses to work after the time set down in the Act and is penalised by the employer for doing so, the case may be presented to a rights commissioner. An employer or employee may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal from a recommendation of a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Children under 16 may be employed by licence in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising work which is not harmful to the safety, health or development of the child and does not interfere with the child's attendance at school. The licence sets out conditions about parental consent, supervision and education arrangements and the maximum working times and minimum breaks appropriate to different age groups.</P>
    <P>At my initiative, a monitoring group was established to appraise the effectiveness of the legislation and to monitor its enforcement. The terms of reference of the group are to review the operation of the Act and to advise on how the Act might be better implemented. I received a submission from this group containing certain measures to improve the enforcement of the legislation and also the operation of the Act. Legal advice on some of the measures is currently awaited.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that all reasonable measures have been and are being taken to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights of young persons in the workplace, I am conscious of the continuing concerns being expressed by various groups, including in the present instance ICTU, regarding the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons. I expect that the arrangements being put in place for the involvement of the labour inspectorate in inspections outside of normal working hours will help address these concerns.</P>
    <P>Regarding the non-provision of payslips to young persons, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides that all employers must arrange that a written statement of wages is given to every employee with every payment of wages. Failure to do so is an offence under the Act. Employees who do not receive payslips should contact the employment rights section of my Department, which will investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>Whereas there is a legal obligation on employers to see that the law is upheld in this area, there is also a moral responsibility on parents to ensure that the objectives of the Act, in regard to both the protection of the education and health of children and young persons, are not frustrated. As previously stated on a number of occasions, I would urge parents and teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the employment rights section of my <Col N="172" /> Department. Such report beaches will be dealt with expediently and every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with the 1996 Act.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Recreational Drug Use.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult topic to cover in five minutes but I will do my best. The danger of soft drugs to the young population has never been addressed effectively through Government policy. As a result, the abuse of soft drugs for recreational purposes is widespread.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight a few alarming facts. Ireland has the highest level of ecstasy abuse in the EU among 15 and 16 year olds. One in ten mid-teen Irish students uses ecstasy and almost one in five uses cannabis. Ireland has the highest drug related death rate of any country in Europe, a figure that continues to rise annually.</P>
      <P>The problem is not confined to one sector of society. It does not matter from what address a child comes, all children will be exposed to recreational drugs. Perhaps what is most frightening is that experimentation with recreational drugs is now the norm for many teenagers. Despite recent large drug busts by the Garda, drugs, and recreational drugs in particular, are more freely available than ever.</P>
      <P>Clearly we as legislators are failing our young if we do not change tack in this area as current measures are failing. The big question is what measures we can introduce to make a definite impact. We must continue with some of the current policies but also introduce some new measures. Targeting pubs and night-clubs to ensure owners take a responsible attitude towards recreational drugs is happening, helped by the introduction of the licensing legislation in 1997 which allows gardaí to search premises. This has resulted in many pub and club owners policing their own premises. Preventative education, primarily in schools, to raise awareness of the dangers of drugs must continue, but has been shown not to be a solution. I sometimes think that for young people, many of whom see themselves as invincible, the more dangerous a substance the more exciting it is to experiment with. Awareness campaigns have clearly not worked in terms of smoking and drinking.</P>
      <P>We must attempt to change the image of drug use. We must make it &ldquo;uncool&rdquo; to use drugs by creating drug free role models, for example, through aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. It seems strange to launch a marketing campaign against something which is illegal, but it must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key area to concentrate on is the relationship between law enforcement and recreational drug use. Currently gardaí are in a hopeless situation. If they come across a person using soft drugs they have little option but to merely give a warning. Gardaí will rarely go through the court process as this would further clog up the court and legal systems and irritate judges in many cases. They also know that many recreational drug users do not belong in prison. As a result many drug <Col N="173" /> users have no real fear of being caught and so do not take the law seriously in this area. Gardaí need to be equipped with a system which is not over the top in terms of severity, but which will ensure they are taken seriously by young people who use recreational drugs. A fair way to do this is to establish a specially designated drugs court which has been promised by the Government. It should be run by drugs experts in coalition with the Judiciary. People should be sent to drugs courts to be assessed if found to be using recreational drugs. A properly trained panel of experts should decide if a penalty is required or if counselling or assistance is necessary, as in the case of severe addicts. A judge could be asked to pass a penalty &ndash; a fine, social work or in serious cases a prison sentence &ndash; if required. Depending on the type and level of drug abuse, the drugs court could give different rulings.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to take a serious look at this area as it is currently being completely neglected. We have not targeted users, but rather have targeted suppliers, with some success. We must now directly target the many thousands of young people &ndash; 15 and 16 year olds and in some cases 11 and 12 year olds &ndash; who are taking ecstasy tablets and smoking cannabis to ensure the stress levels of parents who see their children experimenting with drugs they do not understand are reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for raising this very important matter. The Deputy's concerns most likely refer to the publication of a working paper, &ldquo;The State of Young People's Health in the European Union&rdquo;, which was launched on 21 March by the European Commission in Brussels. The working paper deals with a number of areas which are relevant within the framework of the public health action programmes of the European Community. It provides information on trends in the health of young people, including demographic trends, life expectancy and mortality, mental health, smoking and alcohol abuse, nutrition and physical activity.</P>
      <P>Contrary to press reports, the figures relating to the use of illicit drugs by young people are not new but in fact are derived from the ESPAD &ndash; European Schools Project on Alcohol and other Drugs &ndash; report which was conducted among 50,000 16 year olds in 26 European countries in 1995 and which was published around two years ago. The countries involved were the UK &ndash; with separate samples for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Italy, as well as several Eastern European countries. There is not any information about Germany, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg and the Netherlands and only limited information from Greece, France and Spain. The study was intended to provide benchmarks against which future policies and programmes may be evaluated. A similar survey was carried out during 1999 but the final results will not be published until later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to bear in mind the difficulties of making comparisons across different cultures <Col N="174" /> and the methodological problems that arise in a study of this scale, especially the problems of ensuring that self-reports are valid in all of the participating countries. The conclusions in the report should, therefore, be considered in the context of these particular difficulties.</P>
    <P>Sixteen year olds in the UK and Ireland tend to report somewhat higher levels of illicit drug use than the other countries in the study. It was found that a high proportion who had experimented with illicit drugs had tried cannabis, with 37% of Irish students indicating lifetime use, i.e. they had ever tried it, while 9% reported lifetime use of ecstasy. The proportion of young people reporting life time use of cannabis 20 times or more in Ireland was 10%, compared with 15% in the UK. Current use, that is in the last 30 days, went from 8% who had used once or twice to 7% who had used more than six times. Another important finding was that 61% of students surveyed in Ireland had not ever used illicit drugs.</P>
    <P>Regarding ecstasy, it is striking that in each country, a significant number of young people do not think of occasional use as risky. In a number of countries, including Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia, the majority of respondents were of the view that occasional use was not risky. This is worrying and has implications for those who work with young people and who are designing and implementing drug misuse prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit in my Department implements a wide range of initiatives aimed at creating a greater awareness of the problems of drug misuse and preventing young people from turning to drug misuse in the first instance. It has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science on the  development and dissemination of substance abuse prevention programmes in schools. These programmes are On My Own Two Feet, which was launched in 1994 in second level schools and Walk Tall, which is being disseminated to primary schools since 1998. The unit has also developed a drug education video, a youth support work pack, a community-based drug awareness programme, a leadership training programme for primary prevention of drug misuse and a range of resource materials for parents, teachers, young people and those who work in the field of drug abuse prevention.</P>
    <P>All health boards are also engaged in a wide variety of health promotion and drug prevention activities. The major objective of the Eastern Regional Health Authority's service plan is to provide a broader based prevention and treatment approach aimed particularly at young people. It has ten drug education officers and a further three will be recruited in 2000. These officers and other outreach staff will integrate health board programmes with youth service initiatives and activities in schools. Further work will be undertaken into appropriate interventions in night-clubs and in the dance scene. In the North Eastern Health Board staff are working with club owners to create a greater awareness among staff of drug problems and how to address them.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the problem of drug misuse has been, and remains, two-pronged <Col N="175" /> with strong legislation supported by tough law enforcement measures on the one hand and a multi-agency integrated approach targeted at reducing the demand for drugs on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me to raise this important issue. Respite care is normally debated in general terms in the House. However, I wish to focus on one child in regard to this issue. The Minister of State will be alarmed when I explain the situation regarding respite care in south Tipperary. Two years ago the Brothers of Charity, with financial assistance from the Department of Health and Children, bought St. Rita's in Clonmel to provide respite care for children with disabilities. Nobody will believe me when I tell them that the accommodation is only used every second weekend due to a shortage of funding, staff and other resources. The Minister of State will surely agree that this is illogical, does not make sense and is very unfair to those who are in dire need of respite care.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that this is the only facility in south Tipperary for many children who need such care. The illogical decision to provide money for the accommodation but not for its use does not make sense in this time of plenty. Millions of pounds are available for leisure facilities but where are the few thousand pounds needed to keep this facility open for parents and children in Clonmel? I have tremendous admiration for the South Eastern Health Board and the Brothers of Charity, who are trying to meet the acute demands that are made by parents but cannot do so because of a lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I focused on one individual to put a human face to this issue. I do not want a reply which will inform me about the millions allocated in the budget. This case reflects what is happening on the ground. Over the past 14 months the child involved has received respite care on 28 nights together with two weeks holidays in August, to <Col N="176" /> which everybody is entitled. The parents of that child have received £382 to care for the child over that period. We can take everything for granted. We can attend a friend's wedding, the graduation of a family member or a leaving certificate mass for a child. However, parents awaiting respite care in south Tipperary do not know until the last minute whether they can attend such important family functions because of the lack of respite facilities.</P>
    <P>The few facilities which are available operate on a crisis basis. If one has a crisis, one may be lucky enough to receive care. It is a disgrace for the Government to allow the situation to develop as it has in south Tipperary in regard to respite facilities. I seek funding for St. Rita's so that it can remain open full time. I also demand a co-ordinated, regulated and consistent agenda for respite care in south Tipperary. Parents should know that at least one weekend a month they can attend to family matters and share time with their children and each other. We are not looking for much. I want a system through which parents of children with disabilities will know exactly where they stand and that their child will receive one weekend of respite care per month. That is not too much to ask. Parents consistently must make last minute arrangements and are denied the opportunity to look forward to anything because the funding is not provided by the Department for respite services and staff which are urgently needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, although I am surprised at her comments on St. Rita's, Clonmel. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, was complimented by the national association when he visited the centre on the amount of work he had done in this sphere. Since the Government took office the development of services for persons with an intellectual disability has been a priority within my Department. Substantial additional funding towards the development of these services, totalling £53 million, had been allocated up to the end of 1999. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Government is committed to meeting the identified needs within a defined timeframe of three years beginning with a major acceleration of investment, both capital and revenue, in 2000. The additional revenue funding to be allocated in 2000 is designed to support the development of additional services, including respite services, with an annual cost of £35 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. The funding is enabling the health boards to provide, at a minimum, 555 new residential places; 185 new respite places; 700 new day places; health related support services for persons with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements; and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to services to persons with physical and sensory disabilities additional funding totalling just over £67 million has been provided for <Col N="177" /> the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities since the Government took office. A total of £80 million in capital investment will be provided between 2000 and 2006.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services to persons with disabilities in the south Tipperary region is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board. With regard to intellectual disability services, £2.34 million in revenue funding was allocated to the health board from the overall budget available in 2000. This rises to £2.84 million full year cost. It is anticipated that this will enable the board to provide new services, including 50 new residential places, 20 new respite places and 30 new day places.</P>
    <P>I understand from the health board that in 1999, 51 families in south Tipperary availed of respite within the intellectual disability services. As the Deputy will be aware, numerous agencies provide respite services for children and adults with an intellectual disability in the region. In addition, the board provides families with home support services which offer a flexible service to allow for breaks and-or extra help in the home.</P>
    <P>In terms of the provision of new respite places in 2000, I understand that the health board is in the process of finalising the details of the services to be provided and will submit these to my Department in the near future. The health board was allocated £697,000 this year for development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Pending the development of further purpose-built respite facilities the board also uses nursing homes for respite care on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Funding has been provided by the health board this year to the Irish Wheelchair Association and Tullow Cheshire Home for new respite places in Kilkenny and Tullow.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case outlined by the Deputy, I understand that the individual concerned is currently in receipt of respite services in Brothers of Charity services in Clonmel and St. Patrick's Centre, Kilkenny. The health board is endeavouring, in consultation with the family in question, to arrange for an appropriate future service and is currently in discussion with various agencies in this regard. However, I will bring the Deputy's remarks in regard to St. Rita's to the Minister's notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening. In early February this year, the problem of apprentices being unable to complete their training was first flagged through freedom of information documents obtained by <i>The Irish Times</i>. Phases 4 and 6 of apprenticeship training is carried out in institutes of technology throughout the country and in the Dublin Institute of Technology. Approximately 2,000 apprentices are currently awaiting a place to complete their training because of a shortage of places in third level col<Col N="178" /> leges. Various factors, including lack of teaching staff and the cost of apprenticeship courses, have been identified among the reasons for the current logjam. I understand that the Minister is now tackling these two areas but even taking account of the proposed solution, they continue to be a problem.</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports within the past two days suggest that FÁS might undertake a role which until now has been undertaken by the institutes. Such a process would not solve the fundamental problem. The standard based apprenticeship system, which replaced the time-served model in 1993, is designed so that the apprentices have an opportunity to attend a third level college. Currently, institutes of technology have annual capacity for approximately 7,200 apprentices. The Minister for Education and Science, in a reply to a parliamentary question, indicated that his Department is working closely with the institutes to increase capacity. I would like to know from the Minister if there has been a change in the role of the institutes of technology over the years in regard to support for trade courses and if there are proportionately fewer places for apprentices than previously existed.</P>
      <P>Access to third level education is one of the three main aims of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999. A second aim is that students should be enabled to transfer easily between courses. It is for these two reasons that it would be undesirable to move apprenticeship education from the institutes of technology. Currently, a number of apprentices transfer to technical courses, a transfer which is facilitated by their education in phases 4 and 6 of their apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider three important points in relation to the current crisis in apprenticeship training. First, there is a need for institutes of technology to review their commitment to apprenticeship education in the longer term. Second, to overcome the current crisis, some additional innovative suggestions should be brought forward to ensue that the apprentices can complete their programme as set out for them at the commencement of their training and within the timeframe agreed. Third, in the longer term, a complete review of skills shortages for each of the apprenticeships is needed so that a similar crisis will be avoided over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The current shortage of apprentice places needs to be addressed in a wider context of availability of third level places, overall career guidance and future direction of third level education and training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé lán tsásta freagra oifigiúil a thabhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo agus eolas cruinn beacht a chur faoi bhráid na Dála.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to have an opportunity to respond to the issue raised by the Deputy and to clarify the position regarding the Department of Education and Science's provision for the education and training of apprentices in institutes of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system, <Col N="179" /> which is currently in place, was introduced in 1993 following extensive consultations between the social partners and various other interested parties. It replaced the old time-served model and is based on the attainment by the apprentices of industry agreed standards. The system consists of seven training modules, known as phases, over a minimum period of four years. Phases 1, 3, 5 and 7 involve on-the-job training with the employer. Phases 2, 4 and 6 are delivered off the job. Phase 2 takes place in a FÁS training centre and phases 4 and 6 take place mainly in institutes of technology, to which Deputy Upton has alluded.</P>
    <P>As a result of increased economic activity and a dramatic growth in the construction industry, there has been a significant and unforeseen expansion in the number of apprentices being recruited by employers in the past few years. Apprentice registrations by FÁS were 4,734 in the 1996-97 academic year. The number rose to 6,070 places in 1997-98 and to 6,832 positions in 1998-99. The total number of apprentices in the system is now just over 21,000 young people.</P>
    <P>The exceptional level of recruitment has placed unprecedented demands on the system and it is difficult to expand capacity fast enough to keep up with the demand. As a result, serious problems are now being encountered as the institutes of technology attempt to develop the physical capacity needed to cater for the apprentices who are now due to attend phases 4 and 6 in the institutes. The problem is most acute in certain high growth trades such as carpentry and joinery, electrical, brickwork, plumbing, cabinet making and heavy vehicle mechanics.</P>
    <P>When the increase in numbers became apparent, the Department of Education and Science initiated discussions with the institutes of technology involved about increasing capacity to meet demand. Following a review of the needs and discussions with the institutes in 1998, the Department initiated a multi-million pound capital building programme to provide extra workshop capacity as needed. The objective of this investment is to provide the physical infrastructure as a matter of urgency, but new buildings take some time to plan and deliver. Much of this extra provision, therefore, has yet to come on-stream.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Department of Education and Science has supported the institutes of technology in their efforts to provide extra courses where this has been possible. Extra staff has been sanctioned and other resources have been made available when required. For instance, in the 1998 and 1999 financial years, the Department provided the institutes of technology with a total of £6 million of extra funding specifically to assist with the cost of providing additional apprentice programmes. This was in addition to the funding for apprentices provision already contained in the institutes of technology core budgets.</P>
    <P>Again this year, a further £5 million is being <Col N="180" /> added to the funding provided, in addition to the amount of money made available last year, for the apprentice training in the institutes of technology. These figures confirm the Government's absolute commitment to supporting the further expansion of the apprentice programmes in the institutes of technology, where possible.</P>
    <P>As a result of the measures taken to date, the total number of apprentices catered for in the education system has been increased from about 4,000 places in 1997-98 to about 6,700 places in 1998-99 and to some 7,200 positions in the current academic year. It is noteworthy that the projected demand as agreed by the social partners in 1996 was about 5,000 apprentice places.</P>
    <P>The estimated shortfall in provision for the 1999-2000 academic year is about 185 groups, which approximates to 2,960 apprentices. In an effort to address this shortfall, the Department of Education and Science is expanding capacity as fast as is physically possible in a number of centres throughout the country such as Dundalk, Athlone, Carlow, Cork and Sligo. The possibility of providing extra places at Grangegorman, which is being purchased for the Dublin Institute of Technology and for which we have provided capital recently is also being urgently considered. Other options are also being actively pursued in relation to the Dublin region, which is experiencing the most serious shortfall.</P>
    <P>At this stage I can confirm that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, is planning to increase capacity to provide training for an extra 1,300 apprentices at the institutes of technology from September next. This will bring the total capacity to 8,500 apprentices. In addition, the Department is liaising with the institutes of technology to put in place the necessary arrangements to provide a minimum of 500 apprentices during the summer.</P>
    <P>I understand that the TUI has no objection in principle to the idea of a summer course and while it may wish to set down certain conditions in relation to the running of the courses, these should not present a problem. The summer course has the potential to provide up to 90 extra apprentice groups, or some 500 places. Of course, the success of this initiative will depend on the willingness of the lecturers to work over the summer period. The Department of Education and Science is now liaising with the institutes of technology, with a view to putting the necessary arrangements in place.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister for Education and Science is doing everything possible, in co-operation with the institutes, to meet the increased demand for apprentice training places. He wishes to assure the Deputy, the House and the public that the required resources are available and that the extra capacity required in the institutes of technology will be put in place as soon as the necessary planning and other arrangements can be completed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 March 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 29 February, following my visit to southern Africa, I wrote to Commission President Prodi in January on the issue of HIV-AIDS in developing countries. My letter stressed the need for greater collective action and suggested that there was a case for reviewing the resources devoted to this issue both at Community level and in member states. I also raised the issue of access for developing countries to medicines necessary for the treatment of HIV-AIDS.</P>
      <P>President Prodi has now replied to my letter outlining his shared concerns about the AIDS crisis and indicating that the Commission would welcome a discussion at Council level in the near future of the HIV-AIDS issue. Such a discussion might be based on the review of the implementation of the existing Council regulation governing Community expenditure on HIV-AIDS in developing countries. He suggested that the discussion could also take into account the suggestions presented in a 1998 Commission communication on increased solidarity to confront AIDS. I have also received a response from Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark expressing strong support for my call for a strengthened international response to the challenges posed by HIV-AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, following discussions with the Portuguese Presidency, the issue of HIV-AIDS will, in the first instance, be discussed by Development Ministers at their Council meeting on 18 May. That discussion will enable the Commission and member states, including Ireland, to <Col N="182" /> review the current situation and to consider adaptations to both national and Community policies and expenditure to meet the crisis. The Council discussion could also study such related issues as the supply of medicines and the search for a vaccine.</P>
    <P>The issue of HIV-AIDS will also be discussed at the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit in Cairo on 3 and 4 April which I will attend. I have indicated my interest in speaking in the development debate at the summit and my intention to focus my intervention on the HIV-AIDS crisis. The summit will be an important opportunity to highlight the extent of the challenge facing Africa and to register the fact that HIV-AIDS is no longer just a health emergency but has become a major development issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome recent statements by the President of the World Bank that the bank will grant top priority to the fight against AIDS in its development activities. The bank also intends reallocating resources in favour of HIV-AIDS related projects. This action by the World Bank strengthens the case for more forceful and concerted action by the European Union in this area.</P>
    <P>In coming weeks we will follow closely developments in the European Union and will work with the Commission and member states to focus greater attention and resources on the fight against HIV-AIDS in developing countries. If necessary, I will raise the matter at a future European Council to ensure political support at the highest level in the European Union for actions and resources commensurate with the scale of the crisis.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case we have more than tripled our contribution to UNAIDS to £250,000. We are also doubling expenditure on HIV-AIDS related activities in our bilateral aid programme to over £2 million. We have mainstreamed the fight against AIDS into all of our development activities. Further national contributions to HIV-AIDS related activities are under consideration.</P>
    <P>On a separate matter, Prime Minister Blair wrote to me on 14 April 1999 seeking my support in opposing the proposed directive on <i>droit de suite</i>. I replied at that time indicating our support for their position in opposing the directive on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, that decisions on whether to apply <i>droit de suite</i> should remain with member states on the basis of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>Since that time this matter has been extensively discussed at various levels in the European Union, most recently on 16 March at the Internal Market Council, where it was noted that agreement had been reached on a compromise package which will allow a common position on the proposed directive to be adopted formally by Council in the near future. Details of the compromise text are still being finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In replies to previous questions over the past two years or so on the possibility of convening further meetings of the forum, I indicated that, while this is a matter for the chairperson of the forum and the parties participating in it, the Government would be open to one or more such meetings if this seemed likely to advance progress in the political and peace processes and if support for this course of action was the predominant tendency among the participants in the forum. I also indicated that since the last meeting of the forum on 5 December 1997, the predominant tendency on the part of the forum participants was to concentrate their time and energy on, first, the negotiation, and subsequently, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As I indicated in my reply to questions previously, the latter remains the focus of the Government's policy and efforts. In that context, I envisage that there will be further round table meetings of the pro-Agreement parties, such as took place earlier in the current process of intensive consultations.</P>
      <P>I, however, arranged with the chairperson of the forum for soundings with parties participating in the forum as to their views on an early meeting. At the moment the strongly preponderant view is that it would not be opportune to hold a meeting at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were to be a change of opinion in favour of such meetings, this could provide a context in which consideration could be given, perhaps by the co-ordinating committee of the forum, to finalising outstanding reports of the forum. The draft reports involved were comments of the <Col N="184" /> forum on two consultancy reports which were published in 1995 and a draft report of the forum's Sub-Committee on Obstacles in the South to Reconciliation. It may be doubtful as to what would be the value now of finalising comments on studies published almost five years ago. The draft report of the obstacles sub-committee is in a different category, as it represented the primary follow-up on the undertaking given by my predecessor, former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993. However, while the preparation of the sub-committee's report was well advanced at the time, early in 1996, when forum meetings were deferred, a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge in the meantime in regard to the matters dealt with in the draft report. Thus, if the broad issue were to be taken up again, it might not be a matter of finalising a report but rather of very substantial reconsideration of the issues and extensive redrafting of the draft report.</P>
    <P>There have also been calls, in the context of current efforts to overcome obstacles to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to take forward establishment of the Civic Forum in Northern Ireland and the possible independent North-South consultative forum, as envisaged in the Agreement. The relevant provisions of the latter involve roles for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland and for the Northern Ireland Administration. However, if it were felt to be helpful in the absence of other institutions, the Government would be open to proceed with some form of civic consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>In previous replies here, I stated that in the context of implementation of the Agreement proceeding successfully, the Government would envisage that the role played by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would be discharged by the joint parliamentary forum and North-South consultative forum, envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19 of strand two of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>The private donation of £50 million from Mr. J. P. McManus towards the financing and development of Campus and Stadium Ireland has been given effect by way of a letter of assignation between Pictet and Cie, Geneva &ndash; the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;&ndash; and the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; the &ldquo;Beneficiary&rdquo;. This represents the full extent of the agreement. No other condition or consideration arises. The document was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 February 2000.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to place on record the Government's appreciation of Mr. McManus's most generous donation.</P>
      <P>I met a senior delegation of the FAI on 6 March. In attendance were Mr. Pat Quigley, president, Mr. Michael Hyland, chairman of the national league, Mr. Brendan Menton, honorary treasurer and Mr. Bernard O'Byrne, chief executive. I took the opportunity to convey my view to the delegation that I would like to see it come on board the Stadium Ireland project and my reasons for that view.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The print run for the action plan on implementing the information society amounted to 7,000 copies. Some copies were sent to other Departments and agencies for distribution. For this reason I cannot say exactly how many copies of the action plan have been distributed, but I understand most of the print run has been circulated by now. The action plan is also available from my Department's website. While data are retained on the overall number of hits to the site, the information cannot be broken down to the level of individual publications. As a result, it is not possible to identify the number of hits to the action plan. A progress report on the implementation of the action plan was published on the website last July. Another progress report will be published within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>To increase the visibility of initiatives being undertaken under the auspices of the action plan, a dedicated &ldquo;e-Ireland&rdquo; web page has been set up on the website. This page provides background information on the implementation of the action plan and reports progress on key initiatives and related issues.</P>
      <P>Regarding design principles for Government websites, the action plan provided for the adoption of Civil Service-wide guidelines on the content, format and presentation of websites and for an interdepartmental group to be established to deal with these issues. On foot of this action point, an interdepartmental web publications Group was established to progress this. The group started work in June last and the guidelines were ready in October. I launched the guidelines last November at a seminar for webmasters in the Civil Service. The guiding principle, set out in the guidelines, is that websites should be customer friendly and designed with the needs of users in mind. Information should be up to date, relevant, and easy to find. Other topics covered in the guidelines include content, presentation of websites, promotion of user friendliness, accessibility guidelines and Irish language and bilingualism.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are available on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 to 42, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very strong endorsements by the ICTU and IBEC last week of the Programme for Pros<Col N="188" /> perity and Fairness represent a very welcome step in the continuance of social partnership. These followed on from the equally welcome support given by farming and community and voluntary organisations. The way is now clear for the relevant Ministers and Departments to put in train the necessary arrangements for implementation of the many ambitious aims set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of framework V of the programme sets out the overall monitoring mechanisms which will apply. These include quarterly meetings with the four pillars under the auspices of my Department and including one meeting each year to be chaired by myself. It is envisaged at this stage that three meetings will take place this year, the first in mid-April and the remaining two in July and October.</P>
    <P>Regarding the social inclusion provisions in paragraph 3.6 of the programme, the clarification relates especially to the identification of measures that will be speedily implemented as part of the targeted investment programme in disadvantaged areas, once selected. Having regard to the holistic approach which will be required to tackle the complex social issues in these areas, the scoping exercise to be done is necessary to ensure the effective targeting and co-ordination of resources. It is not, as seems to be implied in the question, that the social inclusion measures in the national development plan lack clarity.</P>
    <P>The processes and criteria to be used in identifying the designated areas and delivering these measures will be pursued in the early period of the programme involving, as necessary, consultations with the social partners. The criteria will have regard to established precedent and good practice in the use of objective indicators of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the progressive introduction of social inclusion measures over the period of the programme, these will form part of the normal budgetary process over the next three years in consultation with the social partners and will be announced in that context. The social partners have already indicated priorities within the framework of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness covers budgets 2001 to 2003, inclusive, and it provides that there will be increases in net take-home pay, including pay increases, of up to 25% or more. The effects of budget 2000 will, in addition, produce significant increases in take-home pay during the period of the programme but these are not part of the programme's terms. While a specific tax package is not set out in the programme, in the light of experience under previous agreements and the prospects under the new programme, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions judged that the average taxpayer would receive increases of 10% in take-home pay arising from tax changes in the next three budgets. The Government responded that this judgment is reasonable having regard to the considerations which I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>The current role of the National Centre for Partnership, as described in Partnership 2000, is the promotion of the partnership approach in the public and private sectors through the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, recognising the progress which has been made, proposes a new approach signalled by a new title and role for the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It is envisaged that the centre will work with IBEC and the ICTU in supporting the deepening of partnership, including through deliberation, consensus-building and dissemination, monitoring, research and analysis, and training and facilitation.</P>
      <P>This will enable the centre to contribute to a more effective tackling of the challenges of ensuring that enterprises, both public and private, are better equipped to adapt to change, including new forms of work organisation, underpinned by effective arrangements of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to initiate discussions with IBEC and the ICTU on the detailed arrangements now that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been ratified.</P>

      <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services, which were published on 22 March, set out the provisional outturn for 1999 expenditure and the estimate for 2000 expenditure for my Department.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn of £19.8 million for 1999 shows that my Department was well within its overall budget for the year, with savings on a number of subheads. In the cases of millennium celebrations and the Moriarty tribunal, some expenditure was deferred to this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the millennium, expenditure in 1999 was lower than was originally anticipated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved. There is a longer lead-in time on capital projects and the millennium office ensures that grants are not made until satisfactory progress has been made on such projects.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Moriarty tribunal, the ongoing work of the tribunal has meant that the bulk of the legal costs, which will arise following completion of that work, have not yet arisen.</P>
      <P>The Revised Estimate for 2000 for my Department is £85.294 million. This is an increase of £48.908 million on the Abridged Estimate, which was published last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase arises for the following reasons: the administrative budget has increased to reflect the carry-forward of savings which my Department made in 1999; subheads which include a pay component have been adjusted to take account of the increases agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; the allocation for grants under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act of 1988 has been increased by £150,000; the additional allocation represents expenditure deferred from 1999; the allocation for commemoration initiatives has increased by £70,000, to reflect an additional allocation made by the Minister for Finance in the context of the budget; the allocation for the millennium celebrations has been increased to £23.2 million; this represents the balance of the £30 million allocation made by <Col N="191" /> the Government to cover the years 1999 and 2000; £300,000 has been allocated to a new subhead which will cover the administration and other costs of the independent commission of inquiry being undertaken by former Chief Justice Hamilton into the bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk; £31 million has been allocated for multimedia developments, including the development of a new research and development institution, Media Lab Europe, and a multi-media village in Dublin; and £10 million has been allocated for the initial development costs of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my recently published policy proposals on governance and accountability in the regulatory process, I am of the view that, as a general rule, a regulatory authority should comprise three members. The legislation governing the Commission for Electricity Regulation already provides for appointing a commission of three members and I will, in the coming months, be giving consideration to appointing a three person commission in the context of expanding the role of the commission to encompass other aspects of the energy sector. I also propose to provide in statute for a three person commission in the case of other regulatory bodies in the telecommunications and aviation sectors. Work is proceeding in my Department on Bills to deal with this, as well as other aspects of my recent policy proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals for a supervisory body of regulators. I do see the need, however, for a periodic formal evaluation of regulatory developments within the utilities area, including an assessment of the continued justification for intervention in the context of the achievement of national economic, social and regional objectives. As I have indicated in my proposals, such reviews should take place on a regular and systematic <Col N="193" /> basis, given the changing nature of technologies and evolution in markets.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy inquires about the relationship, if any, regulators will have with the Competition Authority. It is important that there be clarity as to the respective roles of the Competition Authority and the sectoral regulators. Certain issues concerning this relationship are being addressed by the competition and mergers review group, which is due to report to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shortly. The Tánaiste has also indicated her intention to establish a group to consider broader issues concerning the operation of competition in regulated sectors.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the work initiated by the Tánaiste and I will engage in further consultation with the Tánaiste when the reports become available from the competition and mergers review group and the proposed group to examine the operation of competition in regulated sectors. In the meantime, I would encourage the closest co-operation between the sectoral regulators and the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>I understand also that the joint project is being funded under the US Department of Energy's initiatives for proliferation prevention and will advance the US Department of Energy's nuclear cities initiatives &ndash; there are two US Department of Energy initiatives aimed at employing Russia's nuclear weapons personnel in commercial, non-weapons related enterprises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the need for early certainty on tariffs for third party access to the natural gas network and I will issue a directive to Bord Gáis Éireann in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>The EU gas directive requires member states to open up 20% of their natural gas markets by 10 August 2000. In Ireland we have already opened up more than 75% of our gas market. Those companies which are currently availing of third party access pay the indicative tariff set out in my draft pricing directive of March 1998, which I issued for public consultation. We in Ireland are thus in full compliance with the EU gas directive in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the light of developments in the marketplace since I published the draft directive, including the possible commercial development of the Corrib field and the interest shown by private developers in building natural gas pipelines, I decided not to issue the directive to Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, but instead to undertake a fundamental review of tariffs for third party access to the gas network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I asked BGE to develop proposals on tariff options in the light of the changing market circumstances. BGE consulted widely with interested parties and it presented its report to me in December 1999. This is published on my Department's website. In February I received a report from an interested party which chose not to input into BGE's consultation process.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain an independent view of suitable tariff options, I have engaged economic consultants, the Brattle Group, to examine the reports put to me and to propose a suitable tariff structure for the Irish gas network. My aim is to have a tariff that will promote the development of competition in the supply of natural gas, including the development of new indigenous sources of supply, and provide appropriate economic signals in relation to the establishment of new pipeline infrastructure. The Brattle Group has, in turn, consulted with all interested parties and will present its interim findings at a public forum to be arranged in early April. The consultants are due to present their final report to my Department later in the month.</P>
    <P>When I have considered their report I will waste no time in making a decision on which tariff structure to apply and I will issue a directive to Bord Gáis Éireann in this regard. I will also publish the consultants' report on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of advanced telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Recognising that, in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required advanced telecommunications infrastructural investment, 13 projects supporting the development of advanced telecommunications networks are being co-funded under the INTERREG II and Economic Infrastructure Operational Programmes.

      <P>The specific priorities of local authorities in determining expenditure on central heating and energy efficiency measures in local authority dwellings, are a matter for the local authorities themselves in the first instance, and for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to my own broader responsibilities in relation to maximising energy efficiency, there are a number of policies in place and in the process of development.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which I published last September provides for a major increase in funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy. My commitment to delivering on the Green Paper is highlighted by the fact that I have secured £146 million for this purpose in the national development plan over the period 2000 to 2006. On average, this works out as a tenfold increase in the Exchequer provision for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness, expertise and practice in areas such as appliance purchasing, use of energy in the home, building insulation, heating systems, energy management in industry, the services sector and the public sector. For example, <Col N="198" /> £5 million has been earmarked for insulation improvements for low income households.</P>
    <P>The delivery of this greatly expanded programme requires additional infrastructural development. Therefore, part of the additional funding has been allocated to a major expansion of the resources of the Irish Energy Centre which will carry out new programmes and measures to implement the provisions of the national development plan. As additional staff come on stream, these new measures for the residential and other sectors as outlined in the Green Paper, will be developed and put in place.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper also recognises the potential for greater energy efficiency and consequent CO2 emission savings in the public sector, including local authorities. Chapter five points out the lack of coherence in the State promoting energy efficiency in other sectors if it does not maximise its own efforts in this regard. Therefore, the public sector, including local authorities, will be required to establish, monitor and report in their annual reports on progress towards achieving obligatory energy savings.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper also recognises the role of local energy agencies in promoting energy efficiency at local government level. In following up on this recognition, I have recently undertaken a joint initiative with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to strongly encourage local authorities to establish such agencies under the EU SAVE programme, and to reinforce their support for such agencies where they already exist. The initiative also provides for the long-term funding of the local energy agencies. I am encouraged by the response of local authorities to this initiative and hope that over the next few years, each local authority area will have access to a local energy agency.</P>
    <P>My Department also continues to financially support the work of Energy Action, the charity working to combat fuel poverty by installing energy efficiency material in the residential sector.</P>

      <P>In April 1999 the Government provided funding of £20.7 million for a comprehensive survey of the Irish seabed area. This will be undertaken over a period of seven years and will be managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland, an agency of my Department.</P>
      <P>This is the first such survey ever undertaken on the Irish seabed, which has an area about ten times that of our land area. It will map out the bathymetry of the seabed in detail and provide valuable information on the nature of the seabed itself, as well as its underlying rocks. The results of the survey will be used by a wide range of maritime interests, including fisheries, hydrocarbons, aggregates, engineering and coastal zone management.</P>
      <P>Planning is at an advanced stage and it is expected that the survey will commence this year. The survey is being undertaken in collaboration with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and a number of interested parties, including the Marine Institute.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to the EU Treaty and as such we must pay our contribution to the EU budget. Euratom is financed directly from the general EU budget. There is no separate contribution from Ireland towards the budget of EURATOM.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for administration of the budget contribution is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I am therefore unable to comment on the figures cited in the question.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot, as proposed by the Deputy, withhold its contribution from the EU budget, regardless of how we feel about what the Union is financing under the auspices of a particular Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's policy is to steer EURATOM's activities towards nuclear safety and radiological protection. In fact, EURATOM has been active in both of these areas. For example, EURATOM Directive 96/29 which lays down <Col N="200" /> basic safety standards for the protection of workers and members of the public from the dangers of ionising radiation represents a major piece of EURATOM inspired legislation in the area of radiological protection. I expect to sign into law on 13 May next an order which will give effect to this directive in Ireland. In addition, EURATOM has become a contracting party to the additional protocol to the 1977 agreement between EURATOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Government has approved the text of the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill. This Bill, if passed by the House, will enable the Government to ratify the additional protocol.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work through the various EURATOM groups to ensure, in as far as the Treaty allows, that EURATOM's focus is on nuclear safety rather than nuclear promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The implementation review was published on 7 March last. On the same day, but prior to the publication, I met with the managing director of Iarnród Éireann and his senior management team to express my serious concerns about elements of the report's findings.</P>
      <P>I made it clear during the course of the meeting that I found it unacceptable that the unreasonable risks identified in the original 1998 report had not yet been fully resolved. I also impressed upon him the need to put in place a proper risk management system.</P>
      <P>Follow-up meetings between my Department, Iarnród Éireann and IRMS, have already taken place to identify the actions that are required to address these and other issues raised in the IRMS report.</P>
      <P>Arising from these meetings, Iarnród Éireann is now in the process of preparing a paper outlining its response to the unreasonable risks which remain to be fully resolved. This paper, which I expect to receive shortly, will be considered by my Department and IRMS with a view to agreeing a process for dealing with them in a manner that is acceptable to IRMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> I have also made it clear to Iarnród Éireann that, in line with IRMS's recommendations, the establishment and use of an effective risk management system must be at the heart of the company's safety culture. IRMS will shortly brief the company on the risk model which it uses to evaluate hazards. It will then be a matter for the company to move immediately to develop a risk management system.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the audit was carried out one year into the five year programme. Further audits will be undertaken on an annual basis. In the meantime, my Department will closely monitor progress on the full implementation of all of the recommendations made by IRMS.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that much of the comment on the IRMS report has concentrated by necessity on the negative aspects of the report. However, the report acknowledges the enormous amount of work carried out by Iarnród Éireann to date and I would like to put on the record of the House my appreciation to the staff and management of the company for this valuable work.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the original terms of reference given to IRMS in 1998, it was asked &ldquo;to use appropriate international benchmarks in assessing the safety of the Irish railway system, adjusted where necessary to take account of the particular features of that system&rdquo;. In the reports published to date, the recommendations made by IRMS were made in this context.</P>

      <P>These carriages will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 90 and will provide additional capacity of approximately 2,000 places. A further 16 carriages are also on order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall policy on airports. In recent years, both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals on limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The position of Baldonnel was considered in the recent Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>I note that, with regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals. They believe, however, that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues are addressed in the advisers' report which is now publicly available. I am now giving careful consideration to the findings and recommendations of that report and I will be submitting my proposals for consideration by the Government shortly. The approach to be taken with airline companies or any other interested parties in relation to the possible commercial use <Col N="203" /> of Baldonnel would be a matter for consideration following any Government decision on the future strategy for the aerodrome. Any plans for discussions with such parties would be premature at this stage and are therefore not envisaged.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department and the Department of Defence maintain regular contact in relation to proposals concerning the possible use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes.</P>

      <P>The national development plan, launched last November, sets out the proposals for investment in public transport for the period 2000-06. The plan provides £500 million for the mainline rail renewal and upgrading programme and £65 million of this amount has been allocated to the purchase of additional rolling stock. The allocation of the rolling stock to individual lines and the types of services to be provided on those lines are operational matters for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of 1999 the Dublin-Waterford line has benefited from the substantial investment of £10.7 million under the EU Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99. This investment has been supported by the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. A further £2 million will be spent in 2000. The work involved the replacement of life expired jointed tracks on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme of rolling stock acquisition for mainline rail under the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99 has been completed and the rolling stock was brought into operation in the period 1995-97. This included two loco<Col N="204" /> motives for the Dublin to Waterford route which were co-financed by the EU Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to the details of railway investment other than the EU funded programme. The non-co-financed programme, and its implementation, is a matter solely for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>The technical assistance committee concluded that an Irish Sea tunnel was unlikely to generate adequate revenues to remunerate costs in the foreseeable future and that financial assistance should not be provided for the proposed feasibility study. This information was conveyed to the company concerned in June 1998.</P>

      <P>The progression of participants from community employment into work-training-education-other development opportunities is a significant element of the operation of CE with a view to facilitating the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the open labour market. However, FÁS does not have a set target that all participants must attain which will penalise sponsors if not met. Such targets for specific projects are locally determined, taking into account the context of the local project, including the profile of participants and availability of employment opportunities. Concern about an adequate level of progression in CE is highlighted by FÁS to project sponsors in a way that is relevant to the context of the local project.</P>

      <P>While the EU is not directly engaged in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans, it plays a major role in the promotion of stability and democratic values in the western Balkans region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important peacekeeping missions in the Balkans are KFOR in Kosovo and SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both of which are UN-mandated and NATO-led. Following approval by this House, Irish troops are participating in both missions. EU member states, including Ireland, are contributing a total of some 30,000 troops to <Col N="211" /> KFOR. Both KFOR and SFOR are making vital contributions to peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>In response to requests from the EU, and in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Western European Union has undertaken tasks in the Balkans. These tasks include a police training mission in Albania, MAPE, and a demining assistance programme in Croatia, Western European UnionDAM, both of which are making valuable contributions to peace-building in the region.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my answer to Question No. 42 on 16 February last the Stability Pact, which is a major initiative affecting the whole region, is an EU initiative representing the collective effort of the G8 countries, the countries of the region and key international organisations at addressing the challenges of south eastern Europe in a co-ordinated and strategic manner. The EU Stabilisation and Association Agreements, currently being negotiated with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and probably with Croatia have a key role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>The EC Monitoring Mission, ECMM, monitors political and security developments in the countries of the region, giving particular attention to border monitoring, inter ethnic issues and refugee return. It is an essential tool in the formulation of EU policy in the region. Ireland has participated in the ECMM since its establishment.</P>

      <P>The question of European security and defence policy is the subject of continuing discussion within the EU on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The current position is set out in some detail in the reply of 23 March 2000 to Questions Nos. 23, 60 and 84 on this issue. The Portuguese Presidency presented an interim progress report to the Lisbon European Council on 23 and 24 March 2000 on follow-up to the Helsinki European Council. A fuller progress report is expected at the European Council in June.</P>
      <P>I would recall that the focus of EU discussions is Petersberg Tasks and not mutual defence commitments. Furthermore, in seeking to ensure that the EU has the capabilities required for Petersberg Tasks, the Helsinki European Council made clear that this process is not about creating a European army. The importance of civilian crisis management, including the civilian dimensions of conflict prevention, has been fully recognised by the European Council. Ireland will continue to play an active role in this EU debate.</P>

      <P>This case is being monitored very closely by our embassy in Tehran and by the embassies of our European partners. We are currently seeking clarification of the accuracy of this latest report. Our understanding so far of the Iranian position has been that all of the accused will be entitled to choose their own lawyers. Any departure from this would clearly be contrary to accepted international norms of legal procedure. It is also our understanding that the trial commencing on 13 April will be open to the press and media.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the EU have impressed on the Iranian authorities that we are following this case attentively and that we expect the trial to be fair and open. Démarches have been carried out by the EU Presidency. My predecessor as Foreign Minister, Deputy Andrews, raised the matter with his Iranian counterpart and our views have been clearly and repeatedly expressed to the Iranian ambassador. In the light of any new developments we, along with our EU partners, will consider what further action, if any, may be indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of the ESB has categorically assured me that there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet current demands. Economic growth in recent years has been reflected in high levels of growth in demand for electricity by all sectors of the economy, averaging around 6% per annum in recent years.</P>
      <P>In general, the current and foreseeable levels of growth in demand for electricity will require the provision of between 150MW and 200MW of additional capacity each year for the foreseeable future, by means of new plant or imports over the interconnector. On 24 March 2000 the Commission for Electricity Regulation published a report by the ESB on generation capacity requirements up to 2006. The ESB has recently commissioned the third unit, 160MW, of the plant at Poolbeg and the new 120MW peat fired plant at Edenderry will be coming on stream in December of this year. I understand that three independent power producers have secured planning permission, two of which have been confirmed on appeal.</P>
      <P>A number of other independent power producers have indicated their intention to enter the Irish electricity market. The grid operators on each side of the Border are proceeding with plans to upgrade the existing North-South interconnector over the next 18 months from around 280MW currently to around 400MW.</P>
      <P>The question of granting the necessary authorisations for the building of new plants and licences for the supply of electricity is a matter for the Commission for Electricity Regulation. In view of the high level of interest shown by respective entrants to the market, there is every reason for confidence that sufficient capacity will be built to meet the economy's growing needs.</P>

      <P>In the context of examining the potential of opening Baldonnel Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes, the recent Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report considered the merits of a second airport for the Dublin area. The advisers concluded that Dublin Airport has sufficient capacity to grow for the foreseeable future and that there are no pressing reasons for the State to promote the development of a second airport in the Dublin area as a public policy objective. Nevertheless, the advisers concluded, equally, that there was no reason for the Government to inhibit such a development if it receives appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals.</P>
      <P>The advisers considered that an executive jet development at Baldonnel could be commercial but they felt that a larger scale passenger airport development would be commercially challenging. I intend to bring my own proposals on all the issues raised by the Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report, including Baldonnel, to the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the regions, I do not believe that there is a case for promoting the development of any further airports. The existing six regional airports together with Cork and Shannon provide sufficient airport capacity. The better approach is to concentrate on improving facilities at our existing airports. Aer Rianta has a major ongoing capital investment programme covering its three airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, which will ensure sufficient capacity to cater for future growth at those airports. In addition a sum of £11 million has been allocated under the national development plan to assist with improving essential facilities at the regional airports.</P>

    <P>The subheads comprised expenditure relating to equipment acquisition as well as maintenance, upgrading and operational costs. As regards year on year comparison of the amounts it should be noted that some rearrangement of the content of subheads was necessary during the period for accounting purposes.</P>
    <P>The corresponding expenditure is estimated at £75 million in the current year and £95 million in 2001. The Deputy will be aware that in the context of considering the White Paper on Defence the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force, together with 100% <Col N="219" /> of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. In addition a special allocation of £5 million a year for the next 5 years is being provided to help fund the equipment requirements of the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The savings arising from the restructuring of the Defence Forces are estimated at £20 million per year &ndash; a total of £200 million over the ten year period covered by the White Paper. Together with the revenue of at least £50 million expected from the sale of the six barracks, this will result in a level of investment in the Defence Forces which will ensure that the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are fully equipped with the most modern equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

    <P>I understand that the mycobacterium has never been cultured from commercially pasteurised milk even though the DNA of the organism has occasionally been detected in the UK, and that this failure to culture could indicate that commercial pasteurisation of milk kills the bacterium. A study was carried out in 1999 by the veterinary research laboratory of my Department to determine whether MAP bacteria were present in <Col N="221" /> samples of both pasteurised and unpasteurised milk. All the samples tested negative for MAP.</P>
    <P>A recent report from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland does not recommend any alteration to the current normal pasteurisation methods. However, there is a need to keep the results of international research under review.</P>

The question of expanding the services of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and of creating additional facilities in other parts of the country will be examined as part of this process. The National Rehabilitation Hospital itself has already submitted proposals to my Department for the refurbishment and extension of the hospital. A project team has recently been established to draw up a planning brief based on these proposals. Given the lead-in time necessary for planning, it is unlikely that the building project will commence before the end of 2001.

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An t-Árd Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The particulars to be recorded in the register of deaths are set out in the births and deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and in regulations made under those Acts. The Acts provide that all deaths occurring in Ireland should be registered, in the registrar's district in which they occurred, as soon as possible. The person registering the death &ndash; the qualified informant &ndash; must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner who treated the deceased within 28 days before the death. The qualified informant signs the entry in the register of deaths. The list of qualified informants includes relatives of the deceased and the occupier of the hospital or institution in which the death took place. Once a death has been registered, a certificate of the entry in the register of deaths may be obtained directly from the registrar at the time of registration.</P>
      <P>If the deceased was not seen by a doctor within 28 days or if he or she died as a result of an accident or in violent or mysterious circumstances the death must be referred to the coroner, in which case the death will be registered on foot of a certificate issued by the coroner to the registrar containing all the details to be registered. The arrangements for a post-mortem examination and possibly for an inquest can cause some delay in the registration of a death.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy is aware of a problem in relation to the registration of a particular death perhaps he would communicate the details so that the matter can be investigated.</P>

      <P>The Second Schedule to the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Section 13 of the regulations states that &ldquo;a health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, if it was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10.4 of the regulations sets out the level of abatement whereby a health board in calculating the amount of subvention to be paid to a person, may abate the maximum rate appropriate to that person's level of dependency by the amount which that person's means exceeds the rate of the old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the regulations sets out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000 or more and is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension, or old age non-contributory pension and the person's income is greater than £5,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing this section with a view to increasing the value of the principal residence in line with current market values for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>

      <P>When new units are completed under major developments such as have taken place in these hospitals recently, they are normally commissioned on a phased basis. This can be for operational reasons, including delays in recruiting appropriately qualified staff. In relation to the theatres identified above, resources have been made available to the agencies involved to enable a programme of planned commissioning in the current year.</P>
      <P>This includes £2.718 million which was provided this year to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital to meet the commissioning costs arising from service developments in a number of areas at the hospital. I understand the hospital plans to open one additional theatre this year. A sum of £4.15 million was also provided this year to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of the commissioning of new units, including the theatres, which were completed under phases I and II of the redevelopment of Limerick Regional Hospital.

For those with the condition who require hospitalisation, data are available from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE system which records information on hospitalisations in all publicly funded acute hospitals. The data available in respect of 1994 to 1998 are set out in the following table. Prior to 1994 the system was not sufficiently comprehensive to report national totals reliably. The figures provided include day cases and in-patients. It should be noted that if patients are admitted more than once in a given year, each attendance is recorded separately in HIPE.</P>

      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that it is currently taking a number of steps that should prove a positive influence in relation to the availability of nursing staff in St. Patrick's Hospital as well as other hospitals in its area. These include the provision of overtime to nurses; the rostering of annual leave for the next leave year which will provide the opportunity to put in place permanent locum posts; the board's policy with regard to career breaks, job-sharing, and term-time working is being examined with an attempt to predict activities in these areas for the next five years; the board also intends to carry <Col N="233" /> out an assessment of the nature of work carried out by nurses, particularly in the context of clerical and administrative duties, and care assistant duties; the board will also continue to make efforts to recruit and train nursing staff.</P>
      <P>In 1999, 41 students began undergraduate nurse training at the board's regional training school in partnership with Waterford Institute of Technology. This was the highest recruitment to date and was a result of the board's marketing campaign to promote nursing as a career.</P>
      <P>I have allocated £100,000 to the South-Eastern Health Board in the current year specifically for the purposes of improving the staffing of extended care units for older people. The board proposes to use part of this money for the recruitment of nurses at St. Patrick's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances in each individual case.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it is justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a means tested scheme that provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport to finance the occasional taxi journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; their inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the <Col N="236" /> applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and they must be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>This allowance was introduced in 1979 by Circular 15/79. This circular states, &ldquo;An applicant must be under pensionable age&rdquo;. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met. Therefore a person who is in receipt of mobility allowance when they reach 66 years of age, may still continue to receive it if they meet all the other eligibility criteria stated above.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of a specific case requiring attention, he should supply me with the details and I will arrange to have the matter investigated further.</P>

      <P>The Government's recently published review of An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to target support at home owners with high fixed interest rate local authority loans. This commitment relates to higher fixed interest rates on loans, advanced in the 1970s up to the mid-1980s, which reflected the cost of long-term funds available at that time. Borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free, since 1980, to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance in the private sector. My Department is currently examining options with a view to putting in place measures to implement the Government's commitment as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The scheme does not fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation and therefore the minimum wage will not apply.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to increase the rate of pay or the number of hours which can be worked under the scheme this year. An increase in the rate of pay or the number of hours could encourage well educated and highly employable students to leave the mainstream labour supply. It would be inadvisable to do this in a tightening labour market situation even for short periods.</P>
      <P>The aim of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide financial help to less well-off students who are unable to get summer work and who are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period. The abolition of the means test would change the whole nature of the scheme and would impact on the resources available to help those students who need it most.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Any change to this practice would require very careful consideration as to permit such students to take up employment when they would not otherwise be entitled to do so without a work permit could have serious negative consequences.

      <P>I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in reply to Question No. 291 of 29 February 2000, the position regarding ground rents.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses. Part III of the (No. 2) Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is also no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, introduced as a Private Members' Bill in 1997, raised constitutional, technical and practical difficulties of a kind which cannot be easily overcome. If and when those difficulties can be met in a way that would substantially improve on the already good and reasonable system that exists for the purchase of ground rent, the necessary legislative details will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>There is no discrepancy between the parliamentary question answers and my statement to the Dáil on the following day because I was speaking in the first case about posts and in the second case about the assignment of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the parliamentary questions I said that six executive officer posts and six clerical officer posts had been identified for assignment to Waterford. In making my subsequent speech to the Dáil, when I was referring to the staff numbers, I was referring to requests made by the Land Registry to the Civil Service Commission. That is an important distinction because it does not necessarily follow that staff can only be assigned to Waterford from the Civil Service Commission. They can also transfer from Dublin and I am informed by Land Registry management that some interest in transferring to Waterford has been expressed by Dublin based staff. I also draw attention to what I said about the registry staffing after I gave details of the staffing numbers requested of the commission, and this is very important. What I said was, &ldquo;Additional staff to the above are to be assigned to both <Col N="243" /> offices but the final numbers and grades are yet to be determined&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by Land Registry management that a number of internal competitions for promotion, partly to fill vacancies arising from the creation of the new posts in Dublin and Waterford, are being held or will be held in the next few weeks. When the results of these competitions are known, management will have a clearer picture of who wants to work, on promotion, in both Dublin and Waterford, and who wants to simply transfer. It will then, hopefully be able to fill all vacancies in each location.</P>

      <P>In addition, provision has also been made for two examiner of title posts which are equivalent to principal officer level. I am informed that both of these posts will be based in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The sanction for extra staff for the Land Registry does not provide for any additional posts above principal officer level.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. However, his formal application has yet to be received from the United Kingdom authorities. Following representations made by my Department, the UK authorities advised that they are in the process of collating the necessary documentation and reports required and, when that has been completed, they expect to be in a position to forward his application for my consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that both the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 require that extensive documentation be exchanged between <Col N="244" /> both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they will be forthcoming, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here.</P>
    <P>These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered. However, I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The details sought by the Deputy concerning the number of licences revoked are not readily available, and could not be obtained without a disproportionate expendi<Col N="245" /> ture of personnel resources. Statistics are however available for the number of proceedings taken in 1998 relating to the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years. During 1998, 147 proceedings were taken against the holders of on-licences, and 14 against the holders of off-licences.</P>
      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking are included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the difficulties experienced in many communities by under-age drinking, and I have taken a series of measures to tackle the problem. In 1999 I introduced a voluntary national age card scheme which will greatly strengthen the measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age. Any person who has attained 18 years of age is entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. Over 7,000 cards have been issued to date. The introduction of the scheme will make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 557 of 21 March 2000 which outlines provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which is due to be published this session, which will strengthen the law further on under-age drinking.</P>

      <P>Ballyfermot senior college plays a vital role in providing vocational education and training programmes at further education level and caters for over 1,500 PLC students annually, offering a range of programmes in the field of art, craft and design, business, computing, engineering, electronics, teleservices, multimedia, music, childcare and community care, and tourism. There are no plans at present to upgrade the college to third level status.</P>
      <P>My priority is to maintain a range of levels and the diversity of provision within an expanding further education sector as part of the strategy to promote lifelong learning. Within this context, PLC courses play a particularly important role, providing ongoing education and training for some 18% of school leavers as well as catering increasingly for older adults who are returning to learning. While some 25% of those who complete PLC courses progress to third level education, the majority enter the labour market on finishing their programme, and the sector is recognised as playing an important role in meeting the skill needs of the economy.</P>

      <P>Non-permanent teaching appointments in second level schools arise generally as a result of the replacement of the holders of permanent <Col N="248" /> teaching posts who are on leave of absence; the requirement that the number of permanent teachers employed by individual vocational education committees and community-comprehensive schools may not exceed 95% of their initial teacher allocation; and the allocation of additional temporary teaching resources to the authorities of individual schools to cater for particular circumstances in those schools.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that, in accordance with the provisions of the PCW agreement on teachers' pay and conditions in 1997, my Department agreed to an increase in the number of permanent appointments which can be made in VEC and community-comprehensive schools thereby reducing the number of non-permanent teachers employed in those schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the creation of an additional 800 second level posts in the next school year was announced in December last. In addition, a further 200 posts will be created in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. While a final decision on the actual allocation of these posts has not yet been taken, it is anticipated that very many of these posts will be filled in a permanent capacity.</P>
      <P>Teachers employed in a temporary wholetime capacity are paid at the appropriate point on the common basic salary scale for teachers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The capitation charge referred to by Deputy Haughey refers to the standardised charge levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. When introduced, this charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years. At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed. In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charge would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, it was accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year. In line with the 4% increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260 was accepted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the charge is not paid by students in receipt of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universities further increased this charge by 7% to £278 for the current academic year and this increase was made without my predecessor's approval. Section 40 of the Universities Act, 1997, enables a university to determine and charge fees for student registration, courses, lectures, etc. The Higher Education Authority can review, with the universities, the fees charged by the universities and then, having consulted with me, the Higher <Col N="250" /> Education Authority can advise the universities on the fees, which in its opinion, should be charged. Accordingly, there is no specific statutory requirement for the universities to seek the approval of the Minister for Education and Science for the increase in the student charge. Prior to this year, there was agreement as to the level of increase in the charge and my officials are engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities regarding an agreed procedure for reviewing fee levels in the future.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority issued the framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability to the publicly funded third level institutions in January 1998. The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source. In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards exams-registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has reviewed the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level institutions in relation to the charge and is satisfied that all third level institutions have endeavoured to put in place arrangements that they considered to be appropriate.  On the allocation of the student services charge, the Higher Education Authority notes that the key issue is that appropriate consultation has taken place with students in arriving at decisions. While the aspects of the framework dealing with transparency and accountability were outside the scope of the HEA's review, the authority has reiterated its view that each institution should ensure that information on the expenditure from the fund arising from the charge should be made available to its students.</P>

      <Col N="251" /> These incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage.</P>
    <P>As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>

      <P>The question of providing child care facilities in third level colleges is primarily a matter for each individual third level college. The higher education equality unit published a report, Who Cares in the Campus?, on child care provision in higher education institutions in Ireland in November 1999. The report found that of the 40 institutions which responded to the 1998 all-Ireland survey, 30% provided child care support of some kind. It identifies the different levels of provision currently being made and highlights a number of issues for consideration by the colleges.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's plan to invest over £250 million within the national development plan on the development of a national child care infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In relation to steps being taken by my Department, I would point out to the Deputy that my Department's guidelines on the ESF aided student assistance-access fund for third level institutions refer to the possibility of assisting students with family responsibilities, particularly in relation to child care costs, who face significant financial difficulties. As the Deputy may be aware, this fund amounted to £1.296 million in 1999 which represented a significant increase on previous provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the current academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are set at £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate and £676 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>With some 40% of third level students qualifying for maintenance grants, any proposal that student grants be brought into line with social welfare payments for the unemployed would give rise to considerable cost, estimated by my Department to be in excess of £50 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 1999-2000 academic year is £19,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part maintenance grant, 50%, in respect of which the income limit is £20,400. Where two or more children or the candidate's parent are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, by £4,320 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,160.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and I intend to continue the practice of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases in the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource con<Col N="253" /> straints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the Acts, a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either mature students dependent on parents or independent mature students. A mature student <Col N="254" /> dependent on parents is defined to mean a mature candidate who was ordinarily resident with her-his parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Maintenance grants may be paid to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    <P>An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his-her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
    <P>The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and my Department is examining the issues involved.</P>

      <P>For the current academic year, the rates of maintenance grants payable under the student support schemes are £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate and £676 at the adjacent rate. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance is payable in the case of a grantholder whose normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which she or he is attending. The non-adjacent rate is payable in all other cases. Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from the college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college each day, having regard to the journey and available transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>Statistical information on the higher education grants scheme indicates that some 75% of grantholders qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant. Any proposal to introduce a sliding scale of grant payable to those living within 15 miles of the college being attended would have significant cost and administrative implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 1999-2000 academic year is £19,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part maintenance grant, <Col N="255" /> 50%, in respect of which the income limit is £20,400.

Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to give education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements.

      <P>It is desirable that in drawing up school policy in this area there is prior consultation by the school with teachers, parents and students, where appropriate, so that circumstances identified by the Deputy can be catered for.</P>

      <P>The National Adult Learning Council was first mooted in the Green Paper: Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, published in November 1998, and will be among the proposals to be provided for in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Adult Education. The proposals envisage that the council will be established on a statutory basis to promote and co-ordinate the development of the adult education sector and provide for a major expansion in lifelong learning opportunities. The council will include representation from education and training providers, learners, social partners, community and voluntary interests, participants and accrediting bodies. Liaison with stakeholders in the field, development and monitoring of an agreed co-ordinated strategy and support for staff development and research will form part of the approach. It will take some time to put in place and is one of a phased series of developments proposed for the strengthening of the sector. The council's key focus will be to address the broad ranging needs of adult learners in the education sector, including those in the workforce and those seeking to enter or re-enter it, within the context of an integrated co-ordinated education and training strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, and in the context of adaptation to continuing labour market change, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established a lifelong learning task force in con<Col N="259" /> junction with the Department of Education and Science. The task force includes the social partners and relevant implementation bodies, and will work intensively over a six month period to make recommendations to Government on a range of issues relating to the promotion and enhancement of competitiveness, the upgrading of skills in the workforce and for those seeking to enter the workforce, enhancing access to education and <Col N="260" /> training, removing barriers to access, providing supporting services, and meeting the challenges of change.</P>
    <P>These issues are of major concern to both the education and training sectors, and both Departments are working in close collaboration. The future work and policies of the National Adult Learning Council will be informed by the recommendations of the task force's report.</P>
