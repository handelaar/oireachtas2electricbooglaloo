      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I must deal with an item of private business, the report of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My question still stands. What are the arrangements for taking it? What is the business in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is The Trinity College, Dublin and The University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and it is a matter for this House too. Obviously it would not be coming before this House if it was not a matter for this House. I am interested in the arrangements which must be made here. There is some outstanding business as far as Trinity College is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal way it is dealt with in the other House and then it comes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a report on it, Sir. Obviously it is not for no purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, in the age-old tradition, the Bill is moved in this House to allow the other House to take it. I understand that is the process. This is the technical motion in order that it may be taken in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it have the support of the Progressive Democrats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of amendments proposed by a Member of this House, who is a member of the Government majority but who is not necessarily promoting these amendments on behalf of the Government &ndash; perhaps the contrary is the case. I am interested to know how this matter is to be dealt with. If anybody is wondering who I am talking about, I am referring to Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to allow the report of the joint committee to be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the amendments are in order in the committee they are also in order in the House and if a Member of this House was in a position to promote amendments in the committee, he would also be in a position to promote the same amendments in the House on Report Stage. I am just asking when will Report Stage be taken because we in this House do not delegate our legislative functions to the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion which is before the House is that the report be laid before the Dáil and the report, together with the proceedings of the committee, be printed. It is a matter for the other House to deal with the Bill first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but I am anxious to ask the Leader of the House, who is the Taoiseach, what are the arrangements for taking that aspect or stage of the business which falls to be taken in the House. That is a reasonable question to ask before we accept the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's motion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost respect, Sir, the ordering of business of this House is a matter for this House, not for the other House, and I am posing questions about the ordering of business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may respond to that, a Cheann Comhairle, it is not Government business, it is the Trinity College legislation. The procedure, which is the time honoured procedure to which I understand the Deputy's party agreed last week, is that the Bill would be moved here and taken in the Seanad. It is a Bill which is moved by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. That is the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I clarify a procedural matter in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be a debate on this. I ask the Deputy to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Government is facilitating in Government time the passage of a Bill to be debated somewhere else. Is that correct? If the Government is establishing that precedent regarding Trinity College, may I respectfully ask that it might extend the same facility to the Labour Party to enable a technical motion in Government time to facilitate the Labour Party, which is elected to this House unlike Trinity College, to have its business debated in Private Members' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How does it get on the floor of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it got on the floor of the House is that an all-party committee was established to make way for the Bill to get here. The all-party committee met, as I understand it, agreed it and sent it to us. Obviously the members met, they all agreed and they never told some of their leaders, but that is not my problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I am familiar with all the ramifications of this matter. I am, therefore, concerned that due process should be seen to be done. All I am asking is for the Taoiseach to say when this House's portion of the business, a matter of concern to a Deputy of this House, Deputy O'Malley, for whom I would have thought the Taoiseach would have concern but perhaps he does not, will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not hear anyone opposing the proposal. Following the all-party committee the whips examined the matter in great detail. Deputy O'Malley, who is a whip, explained it to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the arrangements for taking the Bill will be brought before the House <Col N="5" /> by the Taoiseach in the normal way. That assurance is all I sought in the first place and on that basis I am quite happy.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 43, Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 44, Children Bill, 1999, Second Stage (resumed); No. 42, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages to be taken not later than immediately following announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21, the order to be resumed thereafter; and No. 2, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, Second Stage. It is proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Report and Final Stages of No. 43 shall be taken today and that the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.15 p.m. by one question put from the Chair which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down and accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Private Members' business shall be No. 94, motion re. development aid (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has indicated she is considering legislation concerning the re-regulation of the transport sector. The European Commission in its recent annual report criticised the Government's handling of inflation and called for legislation to regulate competition in the transport sector and for enhanced powers for the Competition Authority. What are the plans for legislation to deal with these two matters identified by the EU Commission in its annual report on the Irish economy as critical in terms of its dissatisfaction with the Government's handling of inflation, which is running at twice the European average?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It also pointed out a number of ways in which we should continue to develop the economy. As I have always said, we will be very careful in terms of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach read the remarks of the European Commission? The Commissioner obviously has a better command of certain linguistic terms than the Taoiseach who sometimes refers in blasphemous terms to other people.</P>

      <P>Undertakings were given last week in the House that the letter from the Taxing Master, Mr. Flynn, to the Attorney General would be put before the House. Will this happen? We have made inquiries and it has not happened yet. I tabled a question which was ruled out of order, but the Tánaiste fulsomely explained that the Government was very unhappy with the intemperate attack on the tribunals by Mr. Flynn. When will his public apology be put in the public domain, along with his public attack?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many media reports about the Cabinet and sub-committees of the Cabinet discussing Dublin's underground and over ground transport projects. While I understand the Taoiseach has to take charge of the issue given the procrastination of the Minister on the matter, is it intended that there will be an end to this process? Will legislation be introduced as happened in the case of Luas? Will there be a change to the national development plan? Will the matter be debated or what will the Government do about it?</P>

      <P>A number of weeks ago in her announcement of new appointments to the Arts Council the Minister committed herself to revamping arts legislation, involving wide consultation. At that time she said the former troubles were rotting away and buried forever. How does she square that with the comments of Mr. Paul McGuinness as reported in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>? Has the consultation process started?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 6, after &ldquo;subject&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in particular to Article 23.2 and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main drawback in the legislation is that the decisions of foreign courts must be recognised in regard to child welfare but we cannot always be sure that the foreign court's decision is in the child's best interests. Article 23.2 gives some protection regarding the cases where recognition can be refused and it seems appropriate that the courts should be required to have regard to this. On Committee Stage, the Minister said I was trying to qualify the convention but I was merely trying to highlight the relevant section and I ask the Minister to consider this again.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 states:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>)For the purposes of the Convention any requirement which is not in the opinion of the court in the best interests of the child shall be deemed to be manifestly contrary to public policy.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is designed to copperfasten the objective of amendment No. 1. The Minister accepted on Committee Stage that under the convention an Irish court could be asked to decide something which was not in the best interests of the child. We are seeking to ensure that this is safeguarded <Col N="11" /> as far as possible. Has the Minister reconsidered this point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 would require the District Court to have regard &ldquo;in particular to Article 23.2&rdquo; of the convention in determining whether to recognise or enforce a measure taken by a competent authority in another contracting state under section 3(2)(<i>b</i>). Section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) already requires the District Court to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter IV of the convention, which will have the force of law in the State by virtue of section 2. Chapter IV comprises Articles 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. Consequently, it is clear that the basis for the exercise of the court's jurisdiction in such cases is to be found in those articles, including Article 23.2.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept the amendment the effect could be that it would require the court to exercise its jurisdiction by reference to Article 23.2 above and beyond the provision in the Articles to which I have referred. This seems to be an attempt to qualify the convention and on that basis the amendment is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;manifestly contrary to public policy&rdquo; in amendment No. 2 are to be found in two separate Articles, namely Articles 22 and 23. Article 22 enables the court to refuse application of the provisions on applicable law if application would be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child. Article 23<i>d</i> addresses a separate matter. It enables a court to refuse to recognise a measure taken by a court or authority in another contracting state of such recognition as manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child. If the court here, therefore, is asked to consider the &ldquo;manifestly contrary to public policy&rdquo; exception in the convention as specified in those Articles, it is required to assess it, taking into account the best interests of the child. If the court is satisfied that recognition is contrary to the best interests of the child then it has jurisdiction to refuse recognition under the convention. Section 2 gives the force of law to the provisions of the convention and this includes Articles 22 and 23.</P>
      <P>This issue raised by the Deputy is in part already provided for in the convention and it will be part of our domestic law by virtue of section 2. However, the amendment appears to direct our courts to go further than is provided for in the convention and to allow the courts to refuse recognition of a foreign order in circumstances other than those provided for in Articles 22 and 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve its purpose the convention obliges contracting states to accept the principle that the authorities in all contracting states are equally capable of ensuring a fair hearing to the parties involved and a skilled and humane evaluation of the child welfare issues involved. It may be that <Col N="12" /> in certain cases the jurisdiction of the Irish courts is ousted in favour of the jurisdiction of authorities in other contracting states under the convention. Consequently, it will not be possible for Irish courts to conduct an inquiry into the welfare of the child in all such cases, the principle being that the authorities in the country with which the child has a closer connection, usually the country of the child's habitual residence, are better placed to do so. This is not unusual because it can and does arise under another Hague Convention, the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, which has been part of our law since 1991. That Act, in this connection, has on several occasions been upheld by decisions of the High Court and the Supreme Court. The Bill, for its part, has been examined and approved by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the Protection of Children requires that rights conferred by virtue of the law applicable in a contracting state and measures taken by authorities in a contracting state shall be recognised by operation of law in all other contracting states. The virtues of such a system of automatic recognition are simplicity and certainty in the context of orders relating to the welfare of children. It is based on the assumption of mutual trust that the courts, exercising jurisdiction under the convention, will do so responsibly. This is not an absolute rule and there is a degree of flexibility enshrined in the relevant provisions. Article 23, for example, specifies six instances where recognition may be refused. Most notably, these include an exception where recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the requested state, taking into account the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept these amendments because they would appear to qualify the convention in a way which I suggest is neither necessary nor permissible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" />&ldquo;(4) Sections 33(1), 33(2) and 45 (which provisions relate to the conduct of family proceedings) of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, shall apply and have effect in relation to an application under <i>subsection (1)(b)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the hearing of proceedings under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of section 4 of the Bill will be, as in the case of family law proceedings in general in our courts, as informal as practicable consistent with the administration of justice and that neither judges nor legal representatives will wear wigs or gowns.</P>
    <P>The amendment comprehends two separate types of proceedings under section 4 of the Bill. First, it applies to those proceedings in our courts for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in other contracting states which relate to the welfare of children. Second, it applies to proceedings which empower our courts to make a finding on the suitability of a parent to exercise access to a child in another jurisdiction. Such a finding may be admitted in evidence and considered by the courts of another contracting state which is determining the application for access to the child in accordance with Article 35.2 of the convention.</P>
    <P>The amendment draws on section 45 of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which relates to family law proceedings in the District Court and it draws on sections 33(1) and 33(2) of that Act which deals with cases heard on appeal from the District Court in the Circuit Court. The effect of those provisions is that the proceedings in question must be as informal as possible and that the judge and legal representatives must not wear wigs or gowns.</P>
    <P>The proceedings include the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Child Care Act, 1991, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996. Since most of the proceedings to which the convention will apply are also governed by one or more of those Acts, the scope of the amendment is limited to those cases specified in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) which confer a new jurisdiction on the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>The amendment arises from further consideration of a point raised by Deputy Shortall on Committee Stage and reflects the considerations which underpin the first part of her amendment No. 7. Incidentally, I thank Deputy Shortall for bringing that matter to my attention. She may wish to consider whether her own amendment could be withdrawn on the basis that my amendment addresses in large part the point of her amendment.</P>
    <P>The other effect of her amendment No. 7 is that proceedings under the Bill would have to be heard otherwise than in public. However, this could have some unintended consequences if it were to be accepted. Take, for example, the case of a custody dispute being dealt with by the court <Col N="14" /> under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. If the child is habitually resident in a contracting state to the Hague Convention, the court's jurisdiction here will be governed by the 1964 Act and by Article 5 of the convention, which is given the force of law by section 2 of the Bill. In contrast, it could arise that the court might be asked to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act of 1964 in circumstances which are not covered by the convention. This might arise, for example, in the context of a dispute between parents where the father is resident in the state and the mother and child are resident in a contracting state. Paragraph 39 of the explanatory report, copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library, specifically envisages such a situation. In such a case, the court would exercise its jurisdiction outside the provisions associated with the Bill. The court would, under the proceedings in law which operate in relation to the 1964 Act, have discretion as to whether to hear the proceedings in public.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment, therefore, could be to create different rules depending on whether the child in question was habitually resident in a contracting state. That is something we should avoid. The amendment could also prejudice the operation of the convention in certain cases. Article 36 of the convention empowers the authorities in one contracting state to notify the authorities in another contracting state that a child who is seriously at risk has moved from its jurisdiction to that other contracting state. In that context, it may be necessary for a health board here, for example, to institute court proceedings to compel a person to disclose the precise whereabouts of the child. The exercise of such a jurisdiction would be permissible under the provisions of Article 11 of the convention. In that context, it might be advantageous for the proceedings to be held in public. The amendment Deputy Shortall has put forward would preclude such a public hearing. I accept that would not be the intended consequence of the amendment put forward by Deputy Shortall but that would be the effect of it. For these reasons, I cannot accept the second part of the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)The Central Authority shall take steps to inform the public of its services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable and straightforward amendment. The intention is to ensure that the authority takes appropriate steps to publicise itself. On Committee Stage the Minister, while saying it was not necessary, said there was an acceptance of the principle involved. Has he reconsidered the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The numerous functions of a central authority under the convention are specified in various articles of the convention. In so far as the amendment that is suggested by Deputy Shortall is concerned, Article 30 of the convention is relevant. It requires central authorities to co-operate with each other but also to promote co-operation among the competent authorities in their states to achieve the purposes of the convention. The latter provision is one that will be of significant practical importance because it will require the central authority in the state to inform various authorities of its functions and to ensure that in that connection there is delivery of service as may be necessary. This may extend to such matters as the need to provide a report on the situation of a child or to consider the need to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child. The measures of protection may include the placement of, or provision of care for, a child. These are matters which are fundamental to the operation of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be the duty of the central authority under the convention to engage in communications largely on an inter-central authority basis and, in the state, on an inter-institutional basis. It follows from this that the central authority, as a matter of course, will be engaged directly or indirectly in information exercises as provided for in the convention. As regards making it mandatory on the central authority to inform the public about its services, there is no need for that in the Bill. I am of the view that we can rely on the central authority to use its own good sense and <Col N="16" /> discretion in the light of experience as to whether and what type of information needs to be given to the public about its services. In those circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment which is suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, like the rest of us, is aware of a large number of public services that are available but of which the public is not well aware. Is it his policy to refuse to accept amendments, regardless of how sensible they might be? I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)A solicitor shall not provide a service which may be obtained free of charge from the Central Authority without first informing the client that the service is so available.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this is an eminently sensible amendment. Solicitors should inform clients that a free service is available before taking expensive international proceedings. This amendment is partly related to amendment No. 5. The matter of solicitors not informing clients about the availability of free services arose previously in respect of the child abduction central authority and the problem was never rectified.</P>
      <P>Clients who take the type of proceedings in question are usually in a very emotional and traumatic state and they are desperate to seek help and legal advice. It is only right and proper that solicitors should be obliged to inform clients that there is a free service available because such legal work can be extremely expensive for clients and highly profitable for solicitors. The public should be made aware that a free service is available and solicitors should be obliged to notify their clients of its availability.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the amendment is to protect the public interest and I am anxious to know whether the Minister has had an opportunity to consider its implications. The amendment is sensible and straightforward. It will not give rise to difficulties but will protect members of the public who may find themselves in a vulnerable position and ensure that they are not ripped off by solicitors. People have a right to be informed by solicitors of the existence of a free service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 29 to 31 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1999, and <i>sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11</i> and <i>12 </i>may be cited together as the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 2000, and shall be construed together as one.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to the collective citation. That citation as it stands is predicated on the passage of the Bill in 1999, hence the reference to 1999 in the citation. A formal amendment is now necessary to change the reference to 2000 and there is a difference in style in the new collective citation.</P>
      <P>In so far as amendment No. 10 is concerned, while in the ordinary course there is merit in construing sections of legislation in courts Acts with relevant provisions in other items of legislation for the purpose of construction and collective citation, I am advised that the amendment sought by the Deputy is not required. This is because the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991, deals only with criminal law matters whereas the Bill deals only with civil law matters. Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to this enlightening debate, the tenor of which reflects well on the House. Obviously, there are a number of matters with which I must, of necessity, take issue. Not least of these is the contention expressed by a number of speakers on the opposite side of the House that the Bill did not differ radically from the 1996 Bill which was published by the rainbow coalition Government when Deputy Currie held responsibility for children's matters in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>In Opposition I engaged in heavy criticism of the 1996 Bill because I was of the view that it lacked certainty &ndash; in particular respects it also lacked direction &ndash; and did not take advantage of international best practice to the extent it could have done. My criticisms of that legislation were valid at the time and I stand over them now. I have no regrets for making those criticisms.</P>
      <P>It is true that it took almost two and a half years to bring a new Bill before the House. There were sound reasons for that. First, we had to learn from international best practice how best to proceed. In that regard, the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, went to New Zealand to examine the situation there. He and his officials studied it in great depth and reported back to me. I was satisfied on hearing their report that amendments were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other sources were also studied and, as a result, we began to compile amendments to the 1996 Bill. It became apparent in the course of preparing the amendments that it would not be possible to bring that Bill before the House. A new Bill was required. There are radical differences between the 1996 Bill and the Bill before the House and I am alarmed to hear some Members of the Opposition suggest there is none. <Col N="19" /> The only explanation for such a baseless argument is that people either did not read the 1996 Bill or this Bill or they misunderstood both Bills. It is difficult to understand how anybody could argue that the 1996 Bill is similar to the new Bill unless one accepts one or other of those explanations.</P>

      <P>&mdash;to suggest that the new Bill was not different from the 1996 Bill. The most plausible explanation for that attitude was their desire to clamber aboard with the new legislation and the best way of doing so was to pretend it was the old legislation. That does not wash and I will explain why in the course of this contribution.</P>
      <P>It is easy to exaggerate the incidence of juvenile crime. It has been said that every generation considers it is in the middle of a juvenile crime wave, the likes of which has not before been seen.</P>

      <P>It is also only too easy to become complacent and to shrug off juvenile offending as a part of growing up, from which most youths will emerge unscathed as model citizens. Neither of those scenarios, Deputy Shortall, is a true reflection of reality. One should always wait to hear the full story before one comments hastily.</P>
      <P>Juvenile offending is unquestionably a nuisance. It annoys and irritates society. Much of it consists of anti-social activities, delinquency and vandalism. Much of it also results from thoughtlessness. We do not have a significant problem with serious juvenile offending. Incidents that are almost a daily occurrence in other countries are, to be fair, a rarity in this country. We should not get carried away with our reactions to occasional incidents of serious juvenile offending&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;or the more common examples of anti-social activities. Instead, we should thoroughly examine and understand the problem and work out a rational response. That was done in the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not provide a juvenile justice system that can be neatly packaged and <Col N="20" /> implemented in a rigid manner. It is a statutory framework which will underpin the future development of our juvenile justice system. As such, there is much scope for the system to develop in response to changing circumstances in a way not now anticipated. The present system, for example, which was developed from the Children Act, 1908, had no provision for probably the single most important initiative in dealing with juvenile crime in the 20th century, the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme.</P>
    <P>How the system develops in a constantly changing world is also significant for the cost of implementation. Most Deputies stressed the need for additional resources to implement the Bill. I agree with that assertion. Any worthwhile juvenile justice system that emerges from this legislation will cost money. It will not be possible to implement the Bill on the cheap nor would it be desirable to attempt to do so. Inadequate resources, badly targeted, will only bring the innovative provisions of the Bill into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The most significant resource implications identified for my Department will arise in implementing the provisions relevant to the Probation and Welfare Service. It is anticipated that the eventual annual cost to the Department for implementing those provisions will be approximately £9.85 million. Capital non-recurring costs will be about the same or a little more. With regard to the Department of Health and Children, capital funding has been made available to enable the health boards to put in place an extra 110 high support and special care residential places. More than half of those places are expected to be in place by the end of this year while the remaining places should be in place by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the national development plan, additional capital funding is being made available to health boards for child care services, including services required to implement the Bill. The Department of Health and Children is at present in discussion with the boards on the matter. The Department of Education and Science has a capital development plan for the children detention schools which will cost approximately £20 million, of which about half is directly attributable to its responsibilities under this Bill. It is clear that a co-ordinated plan to implement the Bill is well advanced.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville, Shortall, Currie and others argued that it was not worth waiting three years for this Bill. They thought it could have been produced earlier and made it plain that it differs little from the 1996 Bill. I have made my position clear in that regard. I initiated a complete re-examination of the 1996 Bill. I did not consider it appropriate to current circumstances and was of the view that a new Bill should be produced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville claimed that in answer to a parliamentary question I said there was a total of 15 changes to the Bill. In fact, in my reply on 2 November 1999, I said I was listing some of the more significant changes contained in the new Bill. Deputies Neville, Shortall and Currie have <Col N="21" /> chosen to represent that as the sum total of the amendments. Clearly, that is a misleading argument. In any event, even three or four of the 15 more significant changes are of such importance and have such implications for the direction of the juvenile justice system that the time spent researching those aspects alone was well spent.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I will have to spend the greater part of the time available to me responding to the nonsensical allegations that the two Bills do not differ. However, I will try to answer as many questions on the substance of the Bill as time permits. Part II of the Bill, which provides for the family welfare conference, is new. It extends the parameters of the 1996 Bill in a way which was not envisaged in that Bill. The philosophy underpinning the 1996 Bill focused on preventing further criminal behaviour by children who had already committed their first offence. It was not concerned with primary prevention or early intervention. The family welfare conference provides what many Deputies, including Deputy Shortall, argued should be in the Bill, that is, early intervention in families with problems.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, including Deputy Shortall, argued that a provision regarding early intervention in families with problems should be included. It will do this on an inter-agency basis under the leadership of the health boards. While primarily designed to deal with children with behavioural problems from the juvenile justice point of view, it is a primary crime prevention measure for children. However, it is much more than that and the benefits flowing from it will become clear in time.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Shortall argued for is contained in the legislation. It leads me to conclude again that either the Deputies opposite were being mischievous or they had not read the 1996 Bill or this Bill. The performance of Deputy Shortall at times led me to the view that she was auditioning for a part in the Three Nualas.</P>
    <P>As the report of this debate will be on the permanent record, I should correct Deputy Currie when, speaking on this debate on 29 March, he said:</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a family welfare conference and there will be the introduction of a court directed and supervised family conference . . . Did the Minister even read the 1996 Bill? All these matters were contained in it.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Currie read the 1996 Bill, because he did not read the Bill before the House. I doubt if his memory is failing him or if he did his refresher course. I read the 1996 Bill and fine comb it as I did, I could not find any reference to a family welfare conference nor to any other strategy on primary intervention. Neither could I find reference to a court directed and supervised family conference. I was heartened by the welcome given to this aspect of the Bill by more reasoned Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> It is extraordinary that a Deputy who was a spokesperson and a former Minister of State dealing with a subject as sensitive and difficult as this could misrepresent the position in the House, but Deputy Currie can answer for himself. I believe he is suffering from a fit of pique regarding the abandonment of the 1996 Bill. It was admirable in parts but it would not have served the cause it was meant to serve as well as the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Part IV places the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and provides for a family conference. That was provided for in the 1996 Bill, but where did that Bill provide for an action plan, which is what restorative conferencing is about? Where is the provision for a non-Garda chairperson, which several Deputies have sought, the contract or the restorative cautioning? These provisions will not be found in the 1996 Bill, but they will be found in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There were some good ideas in the legislation introduced by Deputy Currie, but it was necessary to ensure the Bill contained a comprehensive strategy on restorative cautioning and conferencing. There are other changes to Part IV which are too numerous to mention, apart from one or two. It is now supported by a principle, the location of a conference being a Garda station is no longer highlighted and the identity of children admitted to the diversion programme and not just to the conference, as provided for in the 1996 Bill, is protected.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Clune asked what would happen to children not admitted to the diversion programme. The current administrative arrangement is that children can be admitted by the director or, on instruction, by the DPP. This was also the case in the 1996 Bill and it is one aspect I have not changed. The decision will depend on the circumstances of each case, but it is inevitable that placing the programme on a statutory basis will ensure it will be used more and more, especially in respect of children who at present might be regarded as marginally unsuited to it. It will also mean the programme will operate in a more transparent manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hayes and Clune asked what training had taken place in preparation for the family conferencing. To date, 14 juvenile liaison officers have been fully trained and by the end of this week that number will have risen to 38. Training is by the mediation council of Ireland and the JLOs have also undergone a Thames Valley course. I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that restorative conferencing and restorative cautioning will be up and running as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with criminal responsibility and despite what Deputies Neville and Currie said, it is fundamentally different from the 1996 Bill. There was no guarantee in the 1996 Bill that the age would ever be raised to 12 years. The form of words used looked like an exercise in procrastination. I thank all those Deputies who welcomed the new age of criminal responsibility, which will <Col N="23" /> be fixed with certainty at the age of 12. I do not intend to engage in a game of legislative scrabble, but that is what was being undertaken in the 1996 Bill. The age of responsibility might have been set at ten years of age, but it could have been 11 or 12. It is important to have certainty in this respect and that is what we are providing in the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie mentioned that he had agreed to consider a proposal to make it an offence to aid, abet, etc., an under-age child to commit an offence. I do not wish to quibble with him on that, but the amendment he was preparing would have made it an offence to cause such a child to commit an offence. My legal advice is that such a provision is unnecessary but that the offence I have proposed is desirable.</P>
    <P>I have made no major changes to Parts VI and VII, but I have had Part VI re-drafted so that it will be possible to appeal the custody regulations in so far as they relate to children. This will avoid duplication and confusion. Deputy Neville said another adult reasonably named by the child will be excluded from the questioning of a child in a Garda station. Section 61(6) defines reference to a parent or guardian as including adults reasonably named by the child. This was done to streamline the drafting and illustrates the point I made about the many presentational and drafting changes I made in the Bill, but which may not be found in the reply to Deputy Neville's parliamentary question, which appears to have formed the basis for his and Deputy Currie's address to the House. Deputy Neville also referred to the possibility of parents not being present at the questioning. If he compares section 48 of the 1996 Bill to section 61 of this Bill he will notice that the circumstances where questioning can take place in the absence of a parent or guardian have been reduced.</P>
    <P>Part VIII introduces two significant additions to the Bill, each of which changes the direction of the 1996 Bill by adding a new dimension to it. I do not have time to dwell on all of these additions other than to say that the power of the court to adjourn a case and refer it to the health board is now linked to the new family welfare conference system. Also, the court directed family conference to be convened by the probation and welfare system is new. Both these innovative features offer an opportunity to the courts to deal with children brought before them for committing offences in a new way that offers greater opportunities for rehabilitation and could result in no finding being recorded against the child.</P>
    <P>Among the changes I have made to Part IX are the introduction of the parental supervision order, a tightening of the parental compensation order, the introduction of a detention and supervision order, the introduction of rules governing places of detention and providing the courts with the means of avoiding the development of a revolving door in children's detention schools. All of these are major changes to the 1996 legislation. <Col N="24" /> They were not envisaged in 1996. I indicated on the record of the House my deep unhappiness with the 1996 Bill and set about changing it for the better. I have a deep interest in juvenile justice. I am still astounded by the fact that Opposition Members say the new Bill is the same as the 1996 one. It is the most extraordinary assertion to have been made in the House for some time.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Clune mentioned the references in the Bill to St. Patrick's Institution. They are included for technical drafting reasons as they were in the 1996 Bill. However, unlike that Bill, the places which will accommodate 16 and 17 year old offenders will operate under their own rules which are separate from the prison rules intended in the 1996 Bill. It has not been finally decided where these young offenders will be detained, but currently being examined is the feasibility of providing two dedicated detention centres, one in the Dublin area and one in the Munster area.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Shortall were concerned that a revolving door syndrome could develop in children detention schools. Obviously this is a difficult issue. It is not ideal that the schools can refuse to accept young offenders properly referred to them by the courts. On the other hand, a revolving door syndrome would be disastrous for the schools and at odds with their ethos. It could also have constitutional implications. The solution in the 1996 Bill was to give the court power to defer the making of a detention order where no place was immediately available. I was not satisfied that that went far enough, so I have made some changes to the wording of section 144 to link the power of deferment more directly with the availability of places. I have also added section 145 under which the court, where it wishes to make a detention order but no place is available and it would not be appropriate to defer the making of the order, may instead impose the most appropriate community-based sanction.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill no child should be referred to a children detention school if a place is not available. The control is at court level rather than at school door level. This is more appropriate than continuing the current unsatisfactory policy of allowing the schools discretion as to whom they will accept. The system of reports in the Bill, with provisions in Part X concerning the certification of schools as to the number, age and sex of children and the treatment facilities available and the new special residential services board, should ensure that there will be no inappropriate placements in the schools in future.</P>
    <P>Part X has undergone many significant changes since the 1996 Bill, starting with a rewording of the principal object of children detention schools. Deputies Shortall and Fitzgerald did not like the name &ldquo;children detention schools&rdquo;. The name is simply descriptive. The words &ldquo;children&rdquo; and &ldquo;school&rdquo; are obviously essential and we should not be afraid to use words such as &ldquo;detention&rdquo;. The children in these schools will have been found guilty by the courts of committing criminal <Col N="25" /> offences. The suggestion put forward by the Deputies that the schools be called &ldquo;special schools&rdquo;, as they are informally known at present, is especially inappropriate as the schools could be confused with schools for children with special needs. The same point was made by Deputy Ulick Burke who also argued that children in detention schools would lose their educational ethos. The Deputy need only look at Part X to see that sections 157 to 224 represent more than a change of name. If one wishes to sum up the ethos of the schools, one need look no further than section 158 which establishes the principal object of the schools.</P>
    <P>I emphasised in my opening address the importance of the principles and objectives supporting the Bill. Part X provides a more flexible framework for the leave arrangements of children from the schools. Any objective reading of sections 202 to 207 can only lead to the conclusion that we now have a leave scheme which will allow for a separate leave programme to be devised for each detained child. That programme will be one of the most important elements in providing for the reintegration of young offenders back into society. Particular features I have added are mobility trips and unaccompanied absences for such matters as receiving additional training or obtaining work experience.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Currie's remarks, the reason I have removed the provision for a children detention school board is that its functions would have overlapped with the much more innovative and desirable special residential services board provided for in Part XI. Obviously, provision for both boards could not be justified.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville, Currie, Fitzgerald and Higgins referred to the inspection provisions in the Bill. The 1996 Bill included an inspection provision in section 164 and, as it turned out, it was inadequate. I have provided a sophisticated inspection system in sections 185 to 189. I ask any fair-minded person to compare the two. The reason I deleted the reference to inspections taking place at least every six months is the danger that six monthly inspections could become the norm and that they would take place to fulfil a statutory obligation in a predictable manner rather than because they were needed. If Deputies opposite see that as some type of sinister development, we can re-examine it. In response to Deputy Fitzgerald, the social services inspection would concentrate its inspections on child care facilities. In any case, the schools will have their own sophisticated inspection system.</P>
    <P>Part XI introduces the special residential services board. I spoke of this in my opening address and will say no more than to put on record that this is an important new part of the Bill which will be of immense value to every child who is detained in a children detention school or a special care unit. To dismiss it as an amendment is a failure to understand its significance. Last week the Minister of State with responsibility for children announced the membership of the <Col N="26" /> interim administrative board, which is another example of forward planning.</P>
    <P>I realise I have taken up too much valuable time in countering the nonsense that the 1996 and 1999 Bills are indistinguishable. The only matter which I have noticed to be indistinguishable in the course of the debate on the legislation is the speech of Deputy Currie compared with the speeches of Deputies Neville and Shortall. All were on the wrong track and were incorrect in trying to make the case that the Bills were indistinguishable. This Bill is entirely new.</P>
    <P>I wish to answer as many of the remaining questions as I can. Deputy Shortall appeared to suggest that no proper juvenile justice system was operating while the Bill was being prepared. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Garda and the Probation and Welfare Service will tell her the position. We have a crime problem, but the number of crimes committed by juveniles is relatively low. However, juvenile crime must be tackled and this Bill will allow the system to develop in a positive direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said a recent survey showed that 33% of all crime was committed by under 16s. This is another piece of misinformation which is thrown about this House like confetti at a wedding. Statistics do not support the Deputy's position. Some 85,000 indictable crimes were reported in 1998. In the same year 15,000 crimes committed by under 18s were reported to the Garda national juvenile office. That is less than 18% of the total. When one considers that the 18% includes 16 and 17 year olds and summary offences, it can be seen that the extent of the problem is nowhere near that suggested by Deputies Higgins and Shortall. The conclusion one could reach is that their calculators were not working, that they were on an off-morning and were unable to add or subtract or that they were simply being mischievous. One can take one's pick.</P>

      <P>No amount of misrepresentation can hide the fact that since this Government took office crime has decreased by 21% and no amount of misrepresentation can hide the fact that Deputy Shortall was a member of a party which, when in Government, cancelled prisons, prevented the introduction of innovative criminal legislation and failed to increase the number of gardaí and to provide resources to tackle the criminal justice system. Members of that party are now coming into the House with crocodile tears pretending that legislation which has nothing at all to do with them is their own.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall also said that three principles should underline the approach to juvenile justice, namely, prevention, rehabilitation and political commitment. I have no difficulty agreeing with that analysis although I would make the observation that reintegration may be as important as rehabilitation. That is why, unlike the 1996 Bill, this Bill provides primary prevention measures through the family welfare conference. This is the mechanism for early intervention for children at risk which the Deputy rightly identifies as being important. I referred to some of the measures aimed at rehabilitation a few moments ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall did not think that sufficient emphasis was given to the care, education and welfare of children in Part III, which deals with children in need of special care or protection. It is made clear in the inserted section 23B(2) that a special care order authorises a health board to provide appropriate care, education and treatment. While this phrase is repeated later in the section, it only has to be stated once to be law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Currie asked what I meant by the phrase &ldquo;natural grouping of schools&rdquo; in the con<Col N="28" /> text of the management of children detention schools. It means that where there is more than one school on the same campus, as for example in Finglas, one board of management could be appointed to those schools. Legislatively, it is provided for in section 164 and seems a very sensible and efficient way of managing the schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie, who incidentally claimed that this Bill was indistinguishable from the 1996 Bill, asked why the Bill removes the onus from parents to prove that they had a reasonable excuse for not attending court proceedings in which their child is involved. It added nothing to the provision; only the court can excuse attendance at court, and non-attendance in the absence of such excuse can be treated as contempt of court.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGennis understood that family welfare conferences could be triggered in two ways and she is quite correct. That is set out in section 7 and, whether instigated by a court or a health board, it is an exercise in avoiding crises in a child's life, not crisis management, through early intervention on an inter-agency basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes asked whether community service orders would be extended to persons under 16 years of age. The answer is no. In 1983, it was decided to restrict community service orders to the 16 plus age group as otherwise it could conflict with legislation protecting young persons in employment. The day centre order is an alternative activities-based initiative to community service for the under 16 year old age group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes also asked me to outline the compensation provisions of the Bill. Payment of compensation by a child is dealt with in the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, while section 113 of this Bill deals with compensation by parents. The child may have to make reparation, either financial or otherwise, under either of the two restorative conferences or under the restorative cautioning provisions.</P>
    <P>While not entirely relevant to the Bill, I thank Deputy Perry for his interesting comments on shared parenting. As the Deputy said, unless there is abuse or violence, it is usually in a child's best interests to retain contact with both parents when a relationship breaks down.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Collins, Moloney and others for their wide-ranging contributions and, in particular, for their welcome for the restorative justice aspects. The provisions on restorative justice are among the most important initiatives ever taken in this country in the juvenile justice system and I would emphasise that they do not represent an easy option. Deputy Collins also mentioned the co-operation between Departments in the preparation of the Bill which was of critical importance in getting the Bill to this stage and will be of equal importance in its implementation. In this respect, I congratulate and thank the officials involved from the respective Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring asked whether children would be better off when this Bill is enacted. The answer is an emphatic yes. Families and society generally <Col N="29" /> will also be better off as a result of this legislation. I agree with Deputy Ring's comment that jail is no place for children. That is why the Bill prohibits the imprisonment of children and why one of the fundamental pillars of this legislation is that child detention will be a last resort. That is emphasised throughout the legislation.</P>
    <P>However, I could not agree with Deputy Ring when he equated children begging with disadvantage. The problem is far more complex than that, as alluded to by Deputies Brady, Kelleher, Boylan and Timmins. While begging is largely a social problem, the criminal law can be of assistance, in particular where child begging is condoned or organised by adults. The changes I am making to the law on sending children out to beg will do much to alleviate the problem. Deputy O'Sullivan sought clarification of that change. Basically, it reverses the burden of proof so that in future parents will have to satisfy the court that they did not allow the child out to beg. This is a very important change. Changing the burden of proof will unquestionably make a difference in terms of convictions and will lead to this problem being tackled head-on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey expressed some disquiet about setting up the diversion programme on a statutory basis. While I understand his concern, I believe the programme could stagnate without this boost to its status. It will also ensure that the programme will attract further resources and be more transparent in its administration. It will also allow the programme to be expanded to include restorative conferencing and restorative cautioning. The 29 Garda youth diversion programmes funded by my Department will continue to operate on an administrative basis. Deputy Carey thought that the restriction on movement order should apply over longer hours. The problem with that is that it could interfere with a child's legitimate activities such as school attendance and would be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to under-age drinking. There is no doubt that this is the source of much anti-social activity by children. The national age card scheme which I introduced last year, combined with the provisions of the new licensing legislation, should have the effect of making it more difficult for under-age children to obtain alcohol. It also provides more severe penalties for those convicted of selling alcohol to young persons. In future the sale of alcohol to under-age people will be an offence of strict liability and there will be no defence for it. Where there is a doubt about a young person's age, identification should be immediately sought and if it is not forthcoming, I would strongly advise that the person should not be served. If a publican sells alcohol to under-age people, his or her premises will be closed down for a short period for the first offence, a longer period for the next one and will ultimately lead to the forfeiture of a licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney also suggested that 16 to 18 year old detainees should be the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science on the <Col N="30" /> grounds that, otherwise, they would be treated like adults within the prison system. As I already mentioned, 16 and 17 year olds will be detained separately from older detainees in places which will operate under their own rules according to an ethos which will differ little from children detention schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt would not wish to see local voluntary effort sidelined by reason of this Bill. He need have no fears on that account. There are numerous examples in the Bill where voluntary programmes, services and facilities can be used but, of course, only with the agreement of the management of those voluntary initiatives.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ó Caoláin, O'Sullivan and Finucane were concerned that the Bill could not be implemented without additional probation and welfare officers. It is estimated that 63 additional probation and welfare officers and about nine additional clerical staff will be required to fully implement this Bill. Plans are now being drawn up in my Department, as a matter of urgency, to ensure the necessary number of additional professional and support staff will be in place to allow the relevant parts of the Bill to come into operation at an early date.</P>
    <P>Deputies Batt O'Keeffe and Cooper-Flynn mentioned the concern shown in the Bill for the victims of juvenile offending. I was determined, when considering that aspect, to ensure victims would be active participants in family conferences, with their rights and interests protected, and that they would not be silent participants, or even exhibits. Deputy Cosgrave, who had some concerns in this area, can be assured the conference will be a positive experience for victims.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also sought clarification on whether the facilities sought by the High Court were the same facilities being provided under the Bill. The health boards are at an advanced stage in putting in place the necessary residential facilities for children with severe behavioural difficulties who need residential care. These include high support units and the special care units provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely asked if special care orders would restrict a child's liberty. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to enable a health board to apply to the court for a special care order if the child is in need of special care and protection. If the court approves the order, the child shall be committed to the care of the board and placed in a special care unit. It is important to emphasise that, with the introduction of the family welfare conference in Part II, this will be an option of last resort.</P>
    <P>Deputies Theresa Ahearn and Michael Ahern spoke about children getting into trouble after school. This is very true &ndash; a peak time for juvenile offending is the afternoon. The family conference can play an important role in keeping these children, sometimes called &ldquo;latch key kids&rdquo;, off the streets after school. For example, a grand<Col N="31" /> parent or other relative may be in a position to look after the child until the parents arrive home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes talked about the returns to society to be gained by greater investment in child care. That policy underpins the family welfare conference which will allow for earlier intervention where children are at risk. Deputy Barnes also mentioned the Scottish children panels. We considered these, but the panel system, as operated in Scotland, could not be transplanted to Ireland for constitutional reasons. Deputy Cooper-Flynn welcomed the emphasis on family involvement in the various conferences provided for in the Bill. What I have in mind here is that not just the parents or guardian but the wider family, in particular, grandparents or an uncle or aunt, who can have a very positive influence on young persons would also be present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised a question about the sharing of information among care workers. The Data Protection Act may present a problem in some circumstances but, in general, I believe information should be shared between agencies and the agencies should be able to trust each other in that respect. If information is not shared, interagency co-operation falls down, which would be damaging to the success of the Bill. Deputy Fitzgerald also referred to the need for an independent commissioner to enforce children's rights. The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Health and Children is at present preparing legislation to establish an ombudsman for children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke referred to obtaining apologies from seven year olds. Children of that age would be dealt with in the context of the family welfare conference, operated by the health boards. The restorative justice principle, to which the Deputy alluded, is not part of that scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope I have replied to the more salient points raised by Deputies. I also hope I have illustrated unequivocally that this legislation is entirely new. It draws from previous experience, and good ideas contained in the 1996 Bill have not been abandoned. However, it must be clear that there are fundamental differences between this and the 1996 Bill. I say that, not to seek any credit, but to emphasise and explain why it took so long to produce this Bill and bring it before the House. There were cogent good reasons for that. I have no difficulty with Members opposite celebrating that achievement. However, attempting to pretend this is their own legislation is akin to celebrating the victory of the Irish horse in the Grand National and trying to convince oneself one had a bet on it when one had nothing on the horse. It must be clear to everybody that one cannot collect, no matter how much one celebrates, unless one placed a bet.</P>

      <P>Before the House proceeds, I want to make a declaration of interest, so that there is no doubt about the matter. I think I am entitled and obliged to do so under the rules of the House.</P>
      <P>The law firm of which I am privileged to be a partner, Gallagher Shatter &ndash; I have made similar declarations in the past &ndash; has acted for and represented some of the victims of abuse. The firm has been advising victims of abuse about this Bill, its workings and some of the difficulties that may arise with it, as no doubt have other law firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am standing in for our education spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, who is attending a funeral. I do not think anything I will say will relate to any personal financial vested interest. <Col N="33" /> However, if at some stage a member of Gallagher Shatter, solicitors, acts before the commission that is being established, I would not like it to be alleged that I had not made such a declaration. I believe it is appropriate that I do so.</P>
    <P>Any comments or criticisms I make of the Bill will be based on the Fine Gael view of it, taking into account representations that have been received from victims of abuse, the majority of whom my law firm has no contact with and does not represent, but some of whom we do represent. Some of my views and comments will reflect things they have said, not just exclusively to me but to the spokespersons of the other parties and, I understand, at meetings with the Minister. However, it is correct that I make that declaration because, otherwise, my position could be misunderstood.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction on a child of a fear of injury or failure to prevent such a fear, or failure to redress such a fear,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important amendments that I have tabled for Report Stage. It seeks to insert in the definition of abuse the appalling impact of trying to live, survive and construct a child's world in an atmosphere of fear. The words proposed to be inserted are: &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction on a child of a fear of injury or failure to prevent such a fear, or failure to redress such a fear,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As it stands at the moment, the definitions in section 1 refer to:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)the use of the child by a person for sexual arousal or sexual gratification of that person or another person,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)failure to care for the child which results in serious impairment of the physical or mental health or development of the child or serious adverse effects on his or her behaviour or welfare . . .</P>
      <P>My amendment cannot be disposed of by referring to subsection (<i>c</i>) which is a retrospective reconstruction of what might have been an influence on what the child may have suffered.</P>
      <P>Section 1(<i>d</i>), which is the more general one, states:</P>
      <P>any other act or omission towards the child which results in serious impairment of the physical or mental health or development of the child or serious adverse effects on his or her behaviour or welfare,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> My problem with that subsection is in the definition of &ldquo;health&rdquo;. Later on we will deal with other amendments which will include psychological security or mental health. I am interested in this matter which is influenced by my own training as a sociologist. I will put the point simply because I have made the case already on Committee Stage. There is considerable evidence that having to live in an atmosphere of fear could be even more damaging to a child than a once off act of violence itself.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is what has arisen from the description of their circumstances by some of the victims themselves. To put it plainly, if one knew that if a child was removed to a particular room, certain practices would be visited upon the child &ndash; be it punishment by physical abuse or whatever &ndash; the room itself without a child in it would exist as a threat to the children present. Therefore, one has an atmosphere of fear that is oppressive. We are discussing an inquiry which, one must remember, is not dealing with the summary of actions in a forensic sense. It is also dealing with the responsibility for the ethos that was created and which endured, including its manipulation and abuse.</P>
    <P>In an earlier debate we discussed with the Minister's predecessor the loss of files from the Kennedy report. According to the data in those files, it transpired that a child was taken to a landing, stripped naked and punished. The sheer existence of this as a possibility, the retention of that possibility and the creation of an atmosphere of fear is something that not only amounts to violence but also creates a massive potential for violence.</P>
    <P>Looking at this from the point of view of a child's development, the effect is that the child's fear locks his or her development. I cannot accept what the Minister said previously on Committee Stage that there are other sections in the Bill that will deal with this point. It is my judgment that it cannot be handled adequately by the more general subsection (<i>d</i>), or by subsection (<i>c</i>). My proposal therefore is to insert the amendment as a new subparagraph after (<i>a</i>).</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Higgins has said in the context of this amendment. He has made an extremely eloquent case for the commission being allowed to address the impact of children on living in an institution in which children were effectively terrorised. We know from the survivors that abuse came in many forms. Far too many young children suffered direct physical and or sexual abuse within our institutions. Of course, they should not have suffered such abuse. Other children witnessed abusers abusing, but they managed by luck or otherwise not to be on the receiving end of a direct physical or sexual attack. They saw the victims after the abuse had occurred, however. They listened to the cries in the corridors. They watched their friends being taken away in the dead of night, not knowing if <Col N="35" /> someone would tap them on the shoulder half an hour later.</P>
      <P>A great many people who lived in the institutions where these appalling events occurred suffered great trauma, even in the absence of being struck or sexually invaded. The amendment that Deputy Higgins is proposing would allow the commission to have a wider remit, and would extend to it the opportunity and possibility to hear from those who, by witnessing the horrors, were themselves affected, but who fortuitously were not struck or sexually attacked.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people who survived the type of institutional care that we allowed in this State in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Some of them tried to complain about what was happening but they were ignored. That is an issue I will come back to later in the debate. The reality is that in most institutions where there was violence and sexual attack, those who escaped inevitably at some stage were the victims of violence of some description or other.</P>
      <P>The amendment is well thought out, although there is a risk that the Minister may regard it as being too broadly based. His view may be that we should only hear from those upon whom physical or sexual abuse was directly inflicted. I would regard children who witnessed these type of events, however, as having had psychological abuse directly inflicted upon them. In so far as an education was on offer to them, minimal though it was in years gone by, they could not avail of it to any degree because of the state of stress many experienced.</P>
      <P>The amendment is well thought out and it does not fall within the provisions of section 1(<i>d</i>). If, as a child, I witnessed my best friend being severely beaten or sexually attacked, I do not believe the commission could accept my witnessing of those events &ndash; no matter what the impact was on me &ndash; as an act or omission towards me, which results in a serious impediment of my physical or mental health. There would have to have been some act directed at me or some omission in the context of a failure to properly care for me, which might constitute neglect.</P>
      <P>When the commission produces its report it is important that we should have the totality of the story and that we understand the full impact of what happened, historically and not so many years ago, to those children who were supposed to be taken care of within those institutions. We should know the impact on the young innocent witnesses of other innocent children suffering direct physical and sexual attack and abuse. It is important that the commission's terms of reference are clear in this context and that this issue is not a cause of difficulty from the outset. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment and to incorporate his provisions within the terms of the definition of abuse as contained in section 1 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment, <Col N="36" /> a well thought out and well phrased amendment by Deputy Higgins. Returning to what we were discussing in section 1, the ethos of this interpretation seems to be focused solely on the physical manifestation of this abuse and not the threat of abuse to a child. In some cases, the threat of physical abuse to a child can have serious implications for the mental health of that child, sometimes more serious than the physical act itself. Deputy Higgins encapsulates this issue and that threat within the wording of this amendment. It is a fundamental issue which should be considered in the context of this legislation. It is important that we examine not only the physical manifestation but the context in which that happens and the impact that has on other children within the institution. Both my colleagues have elaborated quite effectively on this amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="(Dr. Woods) (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for making clear to the House his interest and that of his law firm in these tragic cases. This amendment relates to the definition of abuse. As I said in committee, in preparing this Bill I was conscious of the need to provide a wide definition of abuse to cover physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect, as was recommended by the commission in its report on its terms of reference. We have tried to keep quite strictly to what the commission recommended and what it asked us to do. We accept its report in full and are implementing it in this legislation. I was concerned that the definition might become so wide as to trivialise the very serious abuses which occurred.</P>
      <P>I noted with care the points made by members of the committee relating to the definition of abuse and based on those points. I have amended the definitions by accepting an amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage. I am satisfied that the definition as it now stands in the Bill is appropriate to the work of the commission. I appreciate that Deputy Bruton is not able to be here. We had arranged that this Bill would start at 4.15 p.m., but because the other business moved more quickly than anticipated, we have found ourselves here earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful that the commission, while it will have a wide remit, is focused in particular on the abuse which has serious consequences for the victims. Most of us have been victims of behaviour in the past which we would now call abuse, but it is not intended that the commission will cover that kind of conduct which may have been acceptable corporal punishment at the time. I am concerned that the amendment would include this kind of conduct and, therefore, make the task of the commission a great deal more difficult. Concerning the question raised by Deputy Shatter about the atmosphere of fear, this is covered by paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of section 4(1)<i>(b)</i>, especially the reference in paragraph (ii) to &ldquo;causes, nature, circumstances and extent&rdquo;. As for other victims who were not actually abused, <Col N="37" /> the commission can receive submissions from any person. That is covered in section 4(5). As far as the commission is concerned, it is entitled to receive submissions from any person who feels that he or she wishes to make such a submission. I do not accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a two minute intervention first. There is a difficulty with section 4(1)<i>(b). </i> Section 4(1) states that the principal functions of the commission shall be subject to the provisions of this Act. I disagree with the Minister on the interpretation of the legislation but if he leaves the definition of section 4(1) as it is, which is tightly constructed around an action, and he has not dealt with the context of anticipation, fear or atmosphere which I have mentioned, section 4(1)<i>(b) </i>will be frail. If he had accepted my amendment concerning section 4(1), section 4(1)<i>(b) </i>interpreted by the commission could include all the circumstances to which he <Col N="38" /> referred. It is a matter of whether one wants to be explicit and indicate a desire to be inclusive or whether one wants to suggest that it is implicit and leave it to chance that this matter would be investigated. We can make progress otherwise but this is one of the most important amendments that I have put down.</P>
      <P>I assure the Minister that I am not put off by the recollective consequences of corporal punishment or those who threaten it. Let us be clear that if it was barbarous then, it is barbarous now. It is barbarous not because of a fashion or because there is a contemporary revulsion to it. That we kept it going for so long is a source of revulsion. The context of fear and the behaviour and attitudes that float from it, not just the physical threat but the body language, are all important. Therefore, it is not my reading that paragraph (iii) of section 4(1)<i>(b)</i> can deal with the amendment I am suggesting to section 1.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 26, before &ldquo;physical&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;mental or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. It extends the definition of abuse to cover mental injury.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to include &ldquo;or failure to redress such an injury&rdquo;. It covers circumstances where a child has been injured, has gone to someone and described it, and no action has been taken. This relates to the previous amendment which was disposed of. An injury which has been reported, with no redress forthcoming, exacerbates a child's fear, not just that an action might take place but that it is a waste of time reporting it. I got the impression that the Minister may be disposed to accepting amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3, in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, proposes to insert &ldquo;pain, distress or&rdquo; in the definition of abuse in section 1(1)(<i>a</i>). If amended, it would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, in relation to a child, means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of pain, distress or physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child,</P>
      <P>This amendment also, to some degree, deals with the ground covered under the previous amendment which the Government voted down. It would ensure that where a child suffers distress, as a consequence of abuse or witnessing another child being abused, it falls within the terms of reference of the commission in considering abuse. The amendment also proposes that the infliction of pain, as well as physical injury, would be included in the definition of abuse. One can suffer pain without necessarily suffering physical injury. Pain can be a symptom of emotional distress. If I am afraid, tense and concerned about my safety, events that may occur, how the abuse others are suffering will affect me or if I will be abused, I may suffer a great deal of pain and distress even if I am not a direct victim of physical hurt. This amendment seeks to extend the definition of abuse as contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The infliction of pain or distress could also extend to an issue I sought to have included as an amendment to the definition of abuse. I submitted my amendment this morning and I understand it has been ruled out of order. I will return to it when we deal with the section. I ask the Minister if this issue is included in any of the legal definitions of abuse and whether he will accept the extension of the concept of pain and distress in the manner suggested in amendment No. 3 to allow for its inclusion. We have learned with some certainty in the past few days that children in residential institutions were used as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical industry, without parental consent and long-term monitoring.</P>
      <P>If children were placed in an institution or home, that institution or home had a sacred duty and trust to care properly for them and to treat them as equally as all other children. I regard it as abuse that a child be used to test untested pharmaceutical products which have not been approved by the relevant regulatory bodies for general use by children. We now know that certain vaccines were used and children were immunised using experimental products. The children were used effectively to test these vaccines. It is scandalous that this occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> This does not fall into the area to which the Minister referred earlier when he was concerned that perhaps years ago corporal punishment was acceptable and if a child suffered mere corporal punishment, that is an issue which the commission should not investigate. I disagree with that view in its entirety but I understand from where it is coming. There was an ethos in society in the 1950s and 1960s where it would appear to have been regarded as a good thing that a child be hit occasionally if he or she misbehaved. We all know that occurred. It did not occur just in residential institutions; it occurred at schools which many Members of the House attended and some Members of the House were probably victims of that sort of behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want that investigated and he is concerned about trivialising, to use his phraseology, the role of this commission. Part and parcel of this commission's inquiry should be the extraordinary breach of trust by institutions and children's homes in apparently making the children under their care available for medical or pharmaceutical research without parental consent, without the children being informed, without their parents or any other relation being informed and without any long-term monitoring as to whether the use of pharmaceutical products had a long-term impact on these children. That is classical abuse. That is abuse which should fall within the remit of this commission.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the definition of abuse in the Bill covers this area. It would be understandable that Ms Justice Laffoy, in her observations to the Government concerning the preparation of this Bill, would not have considered this issue because we did not know the extent to which this occurred. It was rumoured. It has taken two years since I raised this with the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for the commission of inquiry which he put in place, the departmental inquiry, to reach any conclusions. We now have the unofficial leakage of those conclusions but we have not seen the report. Apparently we will not see it for at least another month.</P>
    <P>The people who were in the residential institutions referred to in that report regard what occurred as abuse. We do not know because, as I understand it, there are only three instances which have received any public airing. As I understand it, we are talking about three different events and three different products in the context of the institutions referred to. We do not know how many other residential homes for children made their children available as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical industry in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s when the regulations were not as tight as they were in the United States or in other European countries. That is an issue which now requires a far wider investigation and which will require a debate in this House when this report is finally published.</P>
    <P>Let us get this Bill right. Let us ensure that the definition of abuse in the Bill guarantees &ndash; I <Col N="42" /> want a guarantee from the Minister &ndash; that the remit of the Laffoy commission would extend to hearing from those children who were used to test vaccines; that the commission will have the remit to gain access to any institutional documentation which the informal departmental inquiry apparently could not uncover; that it will hear from the children how these revelations are affecting their lives; that it will have the remit to get medical opinion, if necessary, as to whether there are any long-term consequences of what occurred; and that it will be able to make recommendations, as it will be allowed to do in other areas, for any legislative changes which are necessary in this context.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the definitions of abuse in the Bill allow for this. As not only a Member of this House but as a lawyer who has some experience in this area, it is my view that this issue is not properly and adequately dealt with in that context. This is not a criticism of the Minister because he has become aware of what is in this report only in the past two or three weeks. He may be relying on leaks also because he is responsible for the Department of Education and Science and not the Department of Health and Children. Having drawn it to the Minister's attention and the Minister having become aware of what his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, knows and was able to talk about on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last Monday night, I would have expected that the Minister would have introduced an amendment on Report Stage to address this issue. I want the Minister to clarify the position. I want assurances from him.</P>
    <P>I want him to take on board the amendment in Deputy Bruton's name, amendment No. 3. Perhaps it could be stretched to cover this issue but I am not sure it does. Amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Higgins might be stretchable. It just about covers this issue, but again I am not comfortable that it does. Certainly amendment No. 2 does not do so and I do not think the case would be made that it does. This is an issue which we must get right and today we have an opportunity to get it right.</P>
    <P>This morning I tabled an amendment to allow this serious issue to be expressly included within the definition of abuse. It was tabled before we took Report Stage in the House. It is my understanding that where amendments are tabled to Bills before the debate starts on Report Stage, there is a discretion to allow those amendments to be debated. It has certainly been my experience that in the past in the middle of Report Stage Ministers have come into this House and asked the permission of the Opposition to process additional Report Stage amendments which had not originally been submitted, and we on this side of the House have co-operated on occasion. I want the Minister to have time to consider this issue before Report Stage is completed. My understanding is that the specific amendment which I tabled on this issue has been ruled out of order for being late. I ask the Minister's indul<Col N="43" /> gence to allow that the House agree that that amendment be put before us this afternoon on the resumption of Report Stage in order that it may be discussed. Maybe the Minister will feel today that he cannot take it on board but if we discuss it further this afternoon, it will provide the basis for the Minister to look at this issue when the Bill heads into the Seanad. It is an important issue which the House would be remiss not to address in this Bill in the light of the revelations of the past two weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McGrath)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I suggest you take up that issue with the Ceann Comhairle's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed by Deputy Shatter regarding amendment No. 3, which is in the name of Deputy Bruton. His argument is similar to the argument we made on amendment No. 1, that this definition of physical abuse is too restrictive. The terms &ldquo;pain&rdquo; and &ldquo;distress&rdquo; can encompass the issue of &ldquo;mental duress&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on Deputy Shatter's point, many of those people who were vaccinated in the 1950s and 1960s were and still are under mental duress. They fear they may have been vaccinated and there are questions which arise in that regard. There has been information, which has leaked into the media over time, regarding the Wellcome Foundation, which took part in drug trials which used those children as guinea pigs and which was involved in developing the three-in-one vaccine. Serious questions were raised subsequently regarding the standards of that vaccine and parents believe that their children have been physically and mentally damaged by it. With that in mind, how do these people feel when they consider they may have been guinea-pigs in vaccine trials in these institutions? Because of the concerns raised and medical reports submitted to Wellcome the product was withdrawn. Those children were abused and it was a breach of trust.</P>
      <P>While it would be stretching the amendment, it could still come under its terms. I ask the Minister to examine introducing a specific amendment on this matter and to give the Laffoy commission access not only to institutional documents but to the documentation in the Department of Health and Children which could open a can of worms. There is a serious question as to whether the Department is willing to make the documents available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are suffering immense fear and worry and do not know the implications of the trials. The least that can be done is for the questions raised to be answered. The drug trials were done with the knowledge of the State and the Departments of Health and Education. I am sure the Department of Health and Children and the institutions have the records available, including records of the damage done to children sub<Col N="44" /> sequent to those drug trials taking place. This could result in the truth being brought to light and in putting these people at ease. Parents of brain damaged children should have access to this information. It is a fundamental issue and I urge the Minister to table an amendment which would elaborate on amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the commission will have access to any documents it wants from any Department and can make an order to get any documents. As I indicated, I have considered closely the question of the definition of abuse and have been able to modify it on foot of amendments made on Committee Stage. I am satisfied that following those amendments, the definition is fully appropriate to allow the commission undertake its task. Section 1(1)(<i>d</i>) is very comprehensive. It states: &ldquo;any other act or omission towards the child which results in serious impairment of the physical or mental health or development of the child or serious adverse effects on his or her behaviour or welfare.&rdquo;  I think this will meet the requirements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter raised in particular the recent revelations by way of leak. I have not seen these and do no know what they are. The report will be published in three or four weeks and the only reason for delay is legal, something Deputy Shatter will know very well. People who are named have to be given an opportunity before the report is published. The Minister has made it quite clear that he will make it available as soon as he legally can.</P>
      <P>The failure to protect children or the duty of care which rests on people supervising and managing institutions would seem to cover the position in a very general way. Deputy Shatter mentioned that the remit should extend to hearing from the children. They will all have an opportunity to express any way in which they felt they were abused and the commission will certainly hear these issues. The question concerns the probable need for a very specific investigation into the matter. I cannot prejudge this, but Deputy Shatter pointed out that it is a major issue in its own right and is somewhat different. It has an impact in terms of abuse, but is a much wider issue which needs to be examined in a specific manner. That matter will have to be decided when the report is available. The commission will certainly hear from the people who are concerned. Beyond that we should leave it to the report and see what action is decided upon by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is entitled the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000. Does the Minister believe that these people have been caused pain by being used as guinea-pigs in the vaccination trials which took place in the 1950s and 1960s? Does he believe, therefore, that what will be published in the next month will be termed the abuse of children within institutions and that it should, therefore, come within <Col N="45" /> the terms of the Bill rather than wait to introduce new legislation in the future? We have an opportunity to ensure the Bill encompasses this abuse and that the investigation can be up and running as soon as possible. These children have been abused. There was a breach of trust on the part of the institutions and these people are suffering pain. I assure the Minister that many of the people who will be contacted in the next week or so will have serious concerns. When Deputy Woods was Minister for Health in the early 1980s he was in charge of an investigation into the three-in-one vaccine and he is aware of the implications and some of the things the Wellcome Foundation got up to at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be valuable if we heard the Minister's attitude to amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4. I understood from the proceedings on Committee Stage that the Minister might be disposed to providing for mental as well as physical injury in section 1(1)(<i>a</i>). I would have no difficulty if the Minister indicated he was willing to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 3. I want to make certain that the pain and distress referred to by Deputy Bruton or the mental anguish I referred to is provided for.</P>
      <P>A fundamental principle arises from what Deputy Shatter said. Deputy Shatter speaks of the abuse which took place by lending, as it were, the bodies of children for pharmacological experiments. The Minister is using a different version of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, but this is not only an academic point. For example, one should not be confined in one's definition of &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; to that which one can specify at a given point in time. An example in law is where something has happened without a person's consent, the consequences of which are not known immediately but arise later. In that case, the issue that arises is not whether one can point to the damage that has been done immediately but whether it was done without consent. The use of a person in conditions of trust and care constitutes abuse and I support Deputy Shatter's definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting comment in passing. He said that when the report into the vaccination inquiry is published, a broader report or further investigation may be needed. My point was well synopsised by Deputy Higgins and I have a simple view on this issue. Children were in residential homes and the people caring for them had a sacred trust, which they abused by making the children available to pharmaceutical companies without the consent of parents or other guardians and without informing the children or ensuring their health was fully and properly protected when follow up checks took place. They were made available to test pharmaceutical products and the efficacy of whether there should be a three in one or four in one vaccine and whether there should be a polio light or the real polio vaccine. Children were given vaccines who today do not know whether they are <Col N="46" /> adequately immunised or protected in their adult years as a consequence of what happened during their childhood. That constitutes abuse.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that this may be covered by section 1(1)(<i>d</i>) which refers to &ldquo;any other act or omission towards the child which results in serious impairment of the physical or mental health or development of the child or serious adverse effects.&rdquo;. The very act of making a child available to a pharmaceutical company without parental consent, or a court's consent where there are no parents and its remit is to take action in the interests of the child's welfare, constitutes abuse, even if miraculously in the long-term there are no adverse consequences. No person, whether in the past, present or future, should make children in residential care available for experimentation by pharmaceutical companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's latter point will be comprehended by section 4. There is also the question of the management and supervision of institutions and what was done, and that brings me back to the Deputy's point, which is comprehensively covered under section 4 in terms of the way in which children were affected by the management. Basically, what the Deputy wishes to have covered is comprehended by the legislation. The only reason I mentioned the other issue is that it may be so appalling and different in character that it may need something special in its own right. It is open to the commission to pursue the issue if it wishes.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, in relation to a child, means&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury on, or failure to prevent such an injury to, the child&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 would provide for &ldquo;mental or physical injury&rdquo;. If the Minister indicates that he is accepting amendment No. 3 which would provide for &ldquo;pain, distress or physical injury&rdquo;, I will not press my amendment.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The print run for the action plan on implementing the information society amounted to 7,000 copies. Some copies were sent to other Departments and agencies for distribution. For this reason, I cannot say exactly how many copies of the action plan have been distributed but I understand that most of the print run has been circulated by now. The action plan is also available from my Department's website. While data is retained on the overall number of hits to the site, the information cannot be broken down to the level of individual publications. As a result, it <Col N="50" /> is not possible to identify the number of hits to the action plan.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the action plan was published on the website last July. Another progress report will be published within the next few weeks. To increase the visibility of initiatives being undertaken under the auspices of the action plan, a dedicated &ldquo;e-Ireland&rdquo; web page has been set up on the website. This page provides background information on the implementation of the action plan and reports progress on key initiatives and related issues.</P>
    <P>Regarding design principles for Government websites, the action plan provided for the adoption of service-wide guidelines on the content, format and presentation of websites and for an interdepartmental group to be established to deal with these issues. On foot of this, an interdepartmental group, Web Publications Group, was established to progress this. The group started work in June last and the guidelines were ready in October. I launched the guidelines last November at a seminar for webmasters in the Civil Service. The guiding principle set out in the guidelines is that websites should be customer friendly and designed with the needs of users in mind. Information should be up to date, relevant and easy to find.</P>
    <P>Other topics covered in the guidelines include content, presentation of websites, promotion of user friendliness, accessibility guidelines, Irish language and bilingualism. The guidelines are available on my Department's website.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach, like me and many other people, was appalled to discover that a Bertie Ahern website exists and shows hardcore pornography. Obviously, it is not the Taoiseach's website. Is he concerned that the name of this country's Prime Minister can be used in this way? Has he any proposals to tackle the issue? A few other Ministers have been targeted, most recently Deputy O'Dea. Does the Government have proposals to legislate against this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks. It is a source of some annoyance, if nothing else. It leads to a variety of mail and contacts from people all over the world who either believe or want to believe it is factual. It is not the type of mail anybody would wish to receive.</P>
      <P>A number of people have offered to look at this problem. Legislation will not resolve it. The people responsible for the website have offered to let me buy it for $1 million and they remind me of their offer every few days. A number of groups are looking at how to deal with this problem. It is a worldwide phenomenon but it might be possible to do so. I have received correspondence on the matter from the United States where this type of thing is prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is enormously complex and beyond what I can follow. However, I have asked my Department and some other people to examine <Col N="51" /> how it can be dealt with. The protections that currently exist in both Europe and America are not effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there somebody in the Department assigned to draw down the material on the website each day? It appears that the Taoiseach is being kept up to date on its content. Obviously, it would be a time consuming exercise. How does the Taoiseach keep abreast of what appears on the website?</P>
      <P>When will the Government be ready to notify the public that they can renew their driving licences, pay taxes and carry out many other such tasks by using e-mail and the Internet? The Government is recognised as being at the leading edge of technology. When will that technology be used to improve consumer services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, some people in my Department and technical personnel from outside the Department have looked at the website to see if there is an easy resolution of the problem but they have not arrived at any. When I spoke about people keeping me informed, I was referring to people around the world who see the site and write or e-mail me about what is on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The site is not opened every morning to see what is in it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully not. Approximately £30 million has been allocated this year for action plan projects. The Revenue online project will be ready this year. It is a state-of-the-art online project and has been highly recommended by businesses and trade unions. The REACH initiative which will provide the framework for the delivery of integrated public services is well advanced. In the General Register Office there is a project to undertake the modernisation of the civil registration process. There is also the development of the life events database by the NSSB and a number of awareness campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the action plan there is provision for approximately 40,000 training places for teachers and 20,000 personal computers for the education system. There are a number of initiatives which affect public libraries, media lab projects and awareness campaigns run by community enterprise boards. The action plan is assisting a number of organisations throughout the country under the umbrella of the information society. A Netd@y project, which is now complete, was run during the winter to give members of the public, community groups, active age groups and others an insight into the Internet, and it went extremely well. The members of the public, community groups, community bodies and active age groups gave an insight into the Internet. It went very well. A television series on technology, to be shown on RTE, will be announced shortly. Free Internet access is being made available in all pub<Col N="52" /> lic libraries and kiosks have been installed in social welfare offices to allow clients access to it. An excellent FÁS jobs service is up and running on on-line information and significant resources have been committed to the ICTs in education. All of these have either been done or are ongoing. Some money, which was not spent last year, has been carried over, but that has been put into projects for this year. The Minister for Finance has also made it clear that he will not turn down any other projects in the public service that would help us to get ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the most fundamental forms of intellectual property rights is a person's own name and that if somebody was to acquire the Taoiseach's or my birth certificate from the Superintendent Registrar's office in Lombard Street East and was to use them to acquire something else he would be in breach of the law? Does he agree that squatting on the names of individuals &ndash; his or mine and without the colourful additions &ndash; is a form of theft, of electronic piracy? Does he also agree that a co-ordinated response is required by the WTO, the international organisation to which this country is a member, to eliminate electronic pirates and not to engage, trade or purchase sites that are properly the ownership of people whose names they are, irrespective of what web they must be registered on?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach also agree that it is not beyond the bounds of political opportunity for the Government, working through the EU, the largest trading entity in the world, to raise as a matter of urgency with the WTO, which is the proper body to regulate these affairs, a treaty or legislation that would unilaterally return to all citizens of the globe the right to own their website in their own name? In view of this, does he not also agree that it should be illegal for anybody to attempt to register a website in his ownership with a name manifestly belonging to somebody else? This is the other side of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach has become a victim, not because of who he is as a citizen but because he is Taoiseach &ndash; I hope for a short time &ndash; does he not agree that he has a specific obligation to raise this issue in the WTO with relevant organisations that have a right to do this and that they should not trade with these electronic terrorists and pirates? Does he agree that they should be rooted out of the system altogether and that the citizens of the globe should have the right to own in electronic form their own names, which has been stolen from them at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with any of that. While I have not been involved, this matter has already been raised at EU level and internationally. A number of groups are looking at it. I recently received a report indicating that no successful conclusion has been reached. A group in the US &ndash; not the WTO &ndash; has done enormous work on this over the past four or five years <Col N="53" /> because people from all walks of life, including business and entertainment and not only those involved in public administration, have been targeted. Little has been done in the EU. I had an opportunity at the side of the Lisbon summit to talk to one or two individuals who have looked at this area.</P>
      <P>I do not know to what extent the WTO has been involved. I will check into it. As more people use the Internet following a world-wide campaign to participate, it is remarkable that virtually anything can be done on it apart from protecting one's position. It is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The question on whether piracy in this area is always illegal has not been resolved. One of the arguments is that once people buy and take over a site&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be illegal but it is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be illegal, but approaches to dealing with that have been tried and tested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of efficiency we might dispose of it with a final supplementary question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the right to a person's name is a fundamental component of intellectual property rights? If one does not own one's name one owns little else in terms of intellectual property. Does he agree that the international organisation that vindicates intellectual property rights is the WTO, a body to which virtually every country, for the time being excluding China who will soon become a member, is the proper treaty based organisation within which to initiate a campaign? Does he also agree that the EU is best placed to act in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday we will debate the Patents (Amendment) Bill. Will the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment look at it to see if any provisions can be inserted to ensure that the matter is covered by legislation? There will be difficulties in policing it. For example, how will somebody know if a person in, say, Kathmandu decides to take my name or another person's name because they see it in a newspaper? Committee Stage on <Col N="54" /> the Copyright and Related Rights Bill is ongoing. It may be possible to insert a section in either of these two Bills that will at least provide legislative protection to the Taoiseach's name, my name and other names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at both points and will consider any other suggestions. There is no difficulty in trying to press the matter internationally. I take Deputy Quinn's point about perhaps proceeding at EU level. People whose knowledge of the international web scene is greater than mine and whom I would trust have raised the matter with me. They have not yet found a way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no existing legal way to proceed. It will be necessary to create a legal precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The technical people will have to find an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I have no difficulty with looking at some of the options. I will look at the WTO suggestion and will raise the question of the Patent (Amendment) Bill with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very strong endorsements by ICTU and IBEC of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness represent a very welcome step in the continuance of social partnership. These followed on from the equally welcome support given by farming and community and voluntary organisations. The way is now clear for the relevant Ministers <Col N="56" /> and Departments to put in train the necessary arrangements for implementation of the many ambitious aims set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of Framework V of the programme sets out the overall monitoring mechanisms which will apply. These include quarterly meetings with the four pillars under the auspices of my Department and including one meeting each year to be chaired by myself. It is envisaged, at this stage, that three meetings will take place this year and the dates will be fixed shortly.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Owen's question on the Irish Council for Social Housing, the spirit within which the four pillars in social partnership have operated over recent years suggests the desirability that any organisation wishing to become part of the process should secure the agreement of the appropriate social partner pillar. In the event of a positive response the Government would consider such applications sympathetically, taking due account of such factors as continuance of a fair balance in representation as between the four pillars. The council was advised of the Government's views in this regard but it is my understanding that formal agreement for inclusion under the Community and Voluntary Pillar has yet to be sought. In the context of the new programme, only those organisations involved in its negotiation will be involved in its implementation.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a very significant and comprehensive range of measures which are designed to address social exclusion and inequality urgently and effectively. As well as providing for a substantial increase in the resources allocated to social inclusion, amounting to £1.5 billion in 2003, the programme also sets out a process to ensure that everyone is involved in the development of the economy and society. The overall aim is to enhance the social, working and living environment of all citizens, especially those who, through no fault of their own, have not yet felt the full benefit of our economic success.</P>
    <P>Frameworks III and IV of the programme set out the range of measures to address poverty and social exclusion. I do not propose to go through the list, as Deputies will no doubt be aware of the contents of these frameworks. Some of the key components include commitments on income adequacy, social and affordable housing, health care, tackling educational disadvantage and policies to promote equality and eliminate discrimination.</P>
    <P>The purpose of establishing the interdepartmental committee, referred to in paragraph 3.6 of the programme, is to ensure the substantial increases in funding for social inclusion measures under the national development plan are prioritised towards the areas of greatest need and are co-ordinated and targeted accordingly. To that end, the committee will make recommendations to Government by December 2000 which will enable the 25 most disadvantaged areas to be designated and will ensure that speedy, effective and <Col N="57" /> integrated measures are implemented, taking account of existing and planned delivery mechanisms. There is not, as the question implies, a lack of clarity in the national development plan. It is simply a question of prioritising the social inclusion provisions in the plan towards those areas of greatest need. My Department will participate in the process with the other relevant Departments. Detailed arrangements are the subject of continuing discussion.</P>
    <P>The processes and criteria to be used in identifying the designated areas and delivering these measures will be pursued in the early period of the programme involving, as necessary, consultations with the social partners. The criteria will have regard to established precedent and good practice in the use of objective indicators of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the progressive introduction of social inclusion measures over the period of the programme, these will form part of the normal budgetary process over the next three years in consultation with the social partners and will be announced in that context. The social partners have already indicated priorities within the framework of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness covers the 2001 to 2003 budgets, inclusive, and provides that there will be increases in net take-home pay, including pay increases, of up to 25% or more. The effects of the 2000 budget will, in addition, produce significant increases in take-home pay during the period of the programme but these are not in the programme's terms. While a specific tax package is not set out in the programme, in light of experience under previous agreements and the prospects under the new programme, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions judged that the average taxpayer would receive increases of 10% in take-home pay arising from tax changes in the next three budgets. The Government responded that this judgment is reasonable having regard to the considerations which I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the full implementation of the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will enable our prosperity to continue and be sustained and I know the social partners are no less committed than the Government to its full implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned by the number of people who did not vote for the partnership programme and that the majority who did so are in the lower paid sector of the economy? Does he accept that this indicates some lack of confidence in the Government's ability to deliver the social inclusion measures in the programme? Having failed thus far to provide adequate transport, housing, care for those in need of drug treatment or care for those on hospital waiting lists, which are only some of a litany of failures by the Government, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Government will be able to deliver on the com<Col N="58" /> mitments given to the social partners in the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fifth programme in which I have been involved. I negotiated the four previous ones and implemented the fifth. This is a good programme which received a greater mandate from the people than all the other programmes except for the first one. Its approval rating is greater than 70% which is 10% higher than the previous programme and thus it has a large mandate from union members who voted. I am not sure how every union voted but, with a 70% vote in favour, clearly there is enormous support.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the social evils of unemployment, disadvantage and exclusion are being tackled and that the enormous strides made in the past few decades will continue apace. I still hold the view that the best way for people to play a part in society is by being members of the workforce, having a job and holding on to as much of their income as possible. The national minimum wage and other measures will allow that to happen as never before. The resources being invested in disabilities and the health sector in general will lead to improvements. The Deputy is correct in saying that not all the social ills of the world have been eliminated and they probably never will, but we must continue to do our utmost to try to eliminate them. The questions I have answered spell out the areas where this will be done in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that more than 100,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists would differ with him when he speaks of the success of the economy? Is he also aware that, as well as those 100,000 people waiting for council housing, thousands of young people will never have a hope of buying a house? What proposals does the Taoiseach have to increase house building by local authorities to ensure people do not have to live in the squalor and conditions which were demonstrated on an RTE programme last night, the second part of which will be shown next Thursday? As I understand some of it was filmed in the Taoiseach's constituency, perhaps he would take time on Thursday to look at the programme to see the conditions in which some people in our society must live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not do the work of other Ministers and I will not do it on this occasion other than to say I do not believe the Deputy has the correct figure for social housing. We must continue to target as many resources as possible to help people in need in whatever category they may be. This programme does so and takes into account the areas where we need to do that. We need more infrastructure and housing and we need to deal with a growing population and with the people who need our help. Regarding the programme which was filmed in my constituency, I do not need to watch it because I am aware of <Col N="59" /> the problems, and the people who researched the programme in question spoke to some of my political activists in preparing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree he has been in office longer than any of his predecessors since 1987? Does he agree that, unless he has surreptitiously changed the Constitution, he bears some degree of collective responsibility for the actions of the Cabinet, that, therefore, the failure in respect of the issues Deputy Owen raised reflect upon all the Cabinet and that his attempt to suggest he is not responsible for aspects of his Cabinet colleagues is disingenuous, if not unconstitutional? Does he further agree that there is a lack of clarity in the public domain, which I understand him to have uncharacteristically clarified &ndash; perhaps he would confirm that clarification &ndash; that the combination of wage increases and tax reductions over the next three years during the duration of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will result in an increase of 25% in average take-home pay, and that that increase does not in any way include the provisions in the 2000 budget? The Taoiseach will be aware that there was a difference of opinion between officials from his Department and from the Department of Finance in the latter stages of the negotiations of the programme before it was put to ballot that, to meet the admirable targets set out in the programme, inclusion of the provisions of the current budget would have to be factored in for the overall target of 25% in general terms to be achieved. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the benefits of the 2000 budget, such as they are, are part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. The issue was not between Departments because it was raised and resolved on the night in question and I was closely involved. It was raised during the voting period by some of the unions opposed to the agreement to cause confusion. The people involved knew the answer to the question, which is as the Deputy said. As always, I would make matters absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>Regarding taking a general question and answer session, it is not that I am not responsible for or aware of issues but that I would answer every single question. I already answer questions for over an hour and a half each week, which is probably three times longer than any other Prime Minister in Europe answers questions. If I were to take up all the time for questions, I could probably answer all questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan will invest £40 billion in the infrastructure of the economy. On social housing, the report on the private rental sector is due in June and we are now building twice the number of houses we built before. We need to do more. The infrastructural group is <Col N="60" /> actively engaged in trying to do more and will continue to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of quality of life indicators, how can the Taoiseach be so sure that the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will do anything for the people generally known as disadvantaged or for the general quality of life for all people when one considers deteriorating air quality levels, lower fitness levels, the increase in the number of people with asthma etc? Those issues are not measured and apparently do not comprise part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Does the Taoiseach agree with the CORI figures that one in five of the population is in receipt of income below the EU poverty line of 50% of average household income? Does the Taoiseach envisage that position changing significantly under this programme or does he see such disadvantage coming to an end? If not, does he agree that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness could be challenged in so far as its title may contravene trade description legislation? The programme does not guarantee prosperity and it certainly does not guarantee fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who negotiated the programme were drawn from all sectors of society and the programme represented an enormous effort on the part of those involved. Some 90% of the discussions did not relate to pay issues but rather to how services and economic and employment growth could continue to be improved. The end result of economic and employment growth is quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no quality of life indicators. The Taoiseach is referring to GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what creates quality of life. We have come a long way from the black old days when 400,000 people were unemployed and really lived on the breadline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that an additional 700,000 people are now in employment is an indicator. People have a better quality of life and better educational opportunities, with 60% of young people now progressing to third level education. Those are quality of life indicators. The Deputy represents a constituency in which there is almost full employment. I am sure he is aware that with the development of high quality sports clubs and infrastructure in the area, there is now a better <Col N="61" /> quality of life for the people in north County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the substantial rejection of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by the membership of MANDATE is a direct consequence of the growing gap between low paid workers and other workers? One cannot draw any other conclusion. While noting that the Taoiseach's enthusiasm for the new programme has not waned, will he respond to the comments made by one of the chief negotiators of the agreement who recently informed the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government that rising house prices are wiping out all the gains&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be informed of the Taoiseach's views on this matter. Does the Taoiseach agree with the view that rising house prices are wiping out all the gains of wage agreements over the past 12 years and does he accept that the housing crisis is the primary element in the ongoing increase in the cost of living and the consequential decline in quality of life? Does he agree that unless radical measures to provide housing are adopted by the Government, this programme will be in serious trouble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Deputy should perhaps consider tabling a separate question to him on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The vote against this agreement was 30% as opposed to a 39% vote against the previous agreement. The percentage votes against some of the earlier programmes were in the early 40s. The Deputy is basing his argument on a false premise. Some of the people who voted against this agreement voted against all the previous programmes and stuck rigidly to the view that social consensus of any kind is wrong on this <Col N="62" /> occasion too. They represent approximately 15% of those who voted against pay agreements. We should stick to the facts.</P>
      <P>Obviously, house prices affect a section of the population but they do not affect the 1.7 million people in employment, the one million people in primary, second and third level education or the 500,000 people who will receive increased pensions this year. A particular sector of society is suffering as a result of increasing house prices and the Government is acutely conscious of that. That is why we have taken a huge range of measures in this area over the past two years. We will continue to develop infrastructure, produce legislation such as the Planning and Development Bill and reports such as those carried out by Peter Bacon and introduce initiatives such as the serviced land initiative in an attempt to ease the burden for house buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the serviced land initiative and I want to know whether he is aware that that initiative is not succeeding in providing much needed housing. The Taoiseach did not answer Question No. 8. Will he give a commitment that this House will debate the 25 urban and rural areas which may be designated as disadvantaged before the final list is agreed with the special interdepartmental committee and the Government? We had no say in the development of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which was drawn up by the social partners. We debated the programme after it had been signed, sealed and delivered. When the 25 special areas of disadvantage are to be designated, will the Taoiseach undertake to arrange a debate on the matter before the list is finalised in order that we might have some input into it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

Will it be the same as that applied to the existing area-based partnerships or will we run the risk of creating a new set of areas which are not coterminous with the areas which already exist?</P>

      <P>Perhaps that is why 70% voted in favour of the agreement and 30% voted against it. There are 38 partnership companies throughout the country, many of which were established under the PESP in 1991. An interdepartmental committee has been established to recommend mechanisms and procedures through which these designated areas could be funded. The aim is not to create new structures but to draw upon the expertise of the current initiatives. The committee has examined the experience of the integrated services process to ensure that the planned expenditure provided for in the national development plan will be effectively delivered to these areas.

        <b>:</b> In the context of the Taoiseach's statements on partnership, does he think he is morally justified in the many one-sided attacks he has made on low paid workers, such as the Dublin Bus drivers, who have been seeking a decent wage, when he has never uttered a single word of criticism against rack-renting landlords, who make life such a misery for those low paid workers, or against speculators and developers in the housing market, who also make life a misery?

        <b>:</b> This is on the question of the workings of the agreement. The Taoiseach makes no such productivity demands on developers who have profiteered outrageously in the housing market.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must keep trying to operate measures, such as the minimum wage, decreasing taxation, taking low paid workers out of the tax <Col N="66" /> net and allowing single people and women hold onto more of their income. Those issues help income adequacy, which can be seen from tables published recently by a number of organisations, such as the trade unions, which have produced some good figures on this, and CORI. We must continue with those measures, which I agree with, rather than allow profits to spiral. There is concern about the growth of profit ratios in some sectors of the economy. I have no difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Ó Caoláin, it was not only low paid workers who voted against the programme. Many high paid workers also voted against it because they believe their might is far stronger when there is no social partnership. They are entitled to vote and to their point of view, although I have never agreed with them. Key workers in essential service sectors can use their strength by striking, as has often happened here, to win their argument. Such people are among those who do not like social consensus.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in regard to bus drivers or anybody else. They all do a good job. I said that last week when I was giving out about the begrudgery mentality of some in Irish society, which is what I meant by that. I praised bus drivers and others who provide essential services. However, I also said we should be looking for competitive ways of using the best available methods to get as much efficiency as possible. If that efficiency gives more money to people, so be it, the best of luck to them. That is what happens in industry and there is no reason essential services cannot do likewise. That is why many trade union members, including busmen, are quite anxious to look at some of these competitive ways. They do not want total deregulation&mdash;</P>

I 1999 thug mé deontas speisialta de £17,000 don Chonradh le haghaidh chostais na Seachtaine. D'éirigh go han-mhaith le Seachtain na Gaeilge 1999, agus dá chomhartha sin cheadaigh mé deontas speisialta de £35,000 don Chonradh i mbliana don ócáid. D'fhostaigh an Conradh oifigeach tionscnaimh chun imeachtaí na Seachtaine a leathnú, chun na gníomhaíochtaí a phoibliú agus a chomhórdú níos fearr agus chun cabhair a thabhairt d'eagrais eile, scoileanna ina measc, le himeachtaí a ullmhú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been preliminary contact between officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and my Department in relation to an enhanced role for local authorities in the protection of our archaeological heritage. The issue was also raised by my Department with the County Managers Association last December but it has not yet responded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> The issue of wider responsibilities for local authorities in this area is a complex one which will require detailed consideration and, possibly, legislative changes. It will be a lengthy process but I am committed to exploring the matter fully as I believe that providing local authorities with in-house expertise provides an opportunity to deliver a more efficient and effective regime for management of the archaeological heritage and at the same time does not conflict with their planning and development mandate.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to provide advice and assistance to local authorities on planning and development issues. In this regard, I hope to be able to streamline my service through a combination of additional temporary archaeologists which I am recruiting at present and a repositioning of those resources that are already available to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and obviously she is pursuing the issue. Does she agree each planning authority should have at least one archaeologist on its staff? Does she also agree the current method of carrying out excavations is not very satisfactory? Ground penetrating radar provides a much better alternative whereby archaeological remains will not be damaged because they are first identified in the ground before being excavated. Does the Minister agree there is great urgency about this matter when one considers the criticism of the system by bodies as far apart as the Heritage Council and the Irish Homebuilders Association?</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what she has done, but she should urgently advance this agenda in the interests not alone of protecting our heritage but also of housing and infrastructural development. All the indications are that we are in a bottleneck which will worsen in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his words of encouragement. I view this as a matter of concern and a priority. It is important that we streamline the system to obtain the balance to which the Deputy referred earlier, between protecting heritage and development. I will be answering a question later today concerning a code of practice that has been drawn up with regard to my own Department and the NRA. It alludes to the importance of our archaeology and the fact that we need such developments under the national development plan. We do not wish to have delays but at the same time that balance is required to preserve our heritage. To do that, it is important to have an input from local authorities. That is why I am trying to bring about a situation whereby there will be one archaeologist per local authority. Obviously, a good local knowledge will speed up matters in a number of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may be concerned about the cost of having archaeologists in local authorities. The proposal we will put forward estimates that 30 archaeologists would be needed, at an estimated <Col N="70" /> current cost of £750,000. All this can be seen in the work we are doing under the national development plan, which I hope to publish very soon. I am proposing that half the cost will be met by an annual allocation from my Department for the lifetime of the national development plan. Following that, local authorities would be required to fund the posts. This is a goodwill gesture and it is the way in which I wish to proceed. It is not just a question of speeding ahead to ensure our development. We need to strike a balance between that development and protecting our natural heritage. This is the best way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister contemplating circumstances in which excavation licences would be provided by local authorities? Does she see that as a desirable route? A local archaeologist would have an indepth knowledge of the heritage and archaeology of the area and, therefore, would be in a position to respond much more quickly. What is the Minister's response to the criticism of current archaeological methodology contained in the recent Heritage Council report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I view the provision of excavation licences as being the business of the Department. I see local authorities becoming involved, however, in providing extra knowledge and they would certainly speed up the process by feeding that kind of information to the Department. Local authorities, such as Dublin and Cork corporations, have been working extremely hard in this regard. They have put archaeologists in on a non-statutory basis and have worked the system well.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals she has to develop the Great Blasket Island as a national park; the cost to the State of the appeal to the Supreme Court; if she has visited the Blasket Island; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Following on the Supreme Court decision in July 1999, which declared An Blascaod Mhór National Historic Park Act, 1989, to be invalid, the 1989 Act is no longer available to me to facilitate the establishment of a national historic park on the Great Blasket Island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that future policy on the Great Blasket Island, taking into account a range <Col N="71" /> of issues, is being reviewed at Governmental level. I am not in a position, therefore, to comment further on this issue at present.</P>
    <P>The State's legal costs incurred in the defence of An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park Act, 1989, will be in excess of £1 million. While I have not yet had the opportunity to visit the Great Blasket Island, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, has visited the state-of-the-art visitor centre, Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhóir in Dún Chaoin, which has been in place since 1994.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully committed to promoting the unique cultural, heritage and educational importance of the literary tradition of the Great Blasket Island as evidenced by the ongoing promotion of this heritage, especially by means of Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhóir in Dún Chaoin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 1989 Act is no longer available to the Minister, does she wish to see the Great Blasket now taken over by the State as a national park and will it be from that point of view that she proceeds to Government with her discussions? Did the Attorney General advise that the State should appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court which has cost £1 million? Is it the Minister's intention to call together the various parties and the landowners on the Great Blasket to have a rational discussion about the future of this unique island in terms of what her objective might be regarding the creation of a national park there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Both parties in Government feel very strongly about the protection and preservation of the great heritage which is part of the Blasket Islands and which is important in all sorts of ways with regard to the educational, social and historical understanding of our past. The national park is important. Under the National Monuments Acts, the three main houses there are protected, Peig Sayer's house being one of them. The question of the SACs and the NHAs that will be relevant to that island ensure that the flora and fauna are protected under our law. As the Deputy will be aware, there have been attempts to buy parts of the island. Unfortunately there was not a resolution to our efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>Currently the Government is reviewing what will be the best approach at this stage given that the 1989 Act now falls by way of the Supreme Court case. The Deputy is right in saying that while all of these issues were going through the courts, I sought legal advice on the matter, on foot of which I took a view on the best way to approach these issues. Currently it is being assessed by Government and until Government makes a decision, I will not be in a position to go public. When it is decided the Deputy will be made aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to introduce a Bill following Government discussions, to acquire the Great Blasket and make it a national <Col N="72" /> park? I am aware of the protection of the flora and fauna and so on and the planning process only allows for particular developments. I ask the Minister for further clarification. She obtained legal advice and took that advice and appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Was that legal advice given by the Attorney General?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 163 and 164 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am introducing measures in a number of areas which will have the effect of streamlining the <Col N="73" /> archaeological approvals process and achieving an effective and efficient level of archaeological mitigation. These comprise a review of the archaeological licensing system, a code of practice with the NRA and other developers, an enhanced role for local authorities in the protection and management of the archaeological heritage and adequate resourcing of the archaeological service at central Government level.</P>
    <P>The code of practice between my Department and the National Roads Authority is intended to form the basis of a framework within which that body will be able to progress with its programme of work whilst carrying out appropriate archaeological mitigation having regard to a set of principles and actions agreed by both parties. It is my intention that the code will make provision for appropriate levels of archaeological monitoring on all major road construction projects and that where sites are discovered as a result of such monitoring, they will be investigated in the normal way having regard to the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994, and my published policy and guidelines on archaeological excavations. This involves preliminary investigation to discover the nature and extent of uncovered sites and to carry out further excavation as may be required. There is no question of a minimalist approach being taken to such matters. As I have stated, it is a matter of striking the right balance between badly needed infrastructural development vital to the economic well-being and development of the State and the need to preserve our rich archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>A draft code is being prepared and is the subject of ongoing discussions between the NRA and my officials. I cannot say at this stage what the outcome of these discussions will be but there will not be policy changes which will compromise my overriding responsibilities concerning heritage protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that there will not be a minimalist approach to this. I share the Minister's view that it is important to get the balance between the necessity for economic development through road development and the preservation and proper excavation of as yet undiscovered sites. The Minister received correspondence of 29 March about a situation in County Clare, the Minister's constituency which states the case better than I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an agreement is drawn up between Duchás and the National Roads Authority, will that agreement override the protection given to archaeological monuments? We do not want a situation where, because of political pressure through statements made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority is forced to bring in contractors from abroad to do these big sections together and literally bulldoze their way through archaeological sites and trained archaeologists who are licensed become reluctant partners in the wilful destruction of archaeological monuments. <Col N="74" /> Will the Minister ensure there will be proper pre-planning in terms of defined road lines? When one considers what happened with the development of a much narrower concept, the Kinsale to Dublin gasline, thousands and thousands of archaeological remains were unearthed in that sense. Archaeological excavations need not hold up major road developments.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said there will not be a minimalist approach in the agreement she will draw up between Duchás and the NRA. Will she be able to guarantee that proper pre-planning will take place so that the road development and proper archaeological excavation can proceed together where appropriate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the purpose of drawing up the code of practice to begin with. We need to see where the problems arise and then not leave it until things are running late but to plan properly and have a strategic approach that will incorporate the balance for which we are all looking. To be helpful to the Deputy, I will outline some of the key elements of the code of practice because that might allay any fears.</P>
      <P>There are just four points, one of which is an ongoing partnership and liaison whereby potential difficulties can be flagged in advance and dealt with in a structured way, which answers the question put to me just now by the Deputy. Another is the provision for the archaeological impacts to be made at the earliest possible planning stages of road construction projects to allow proper archaeological mitigation to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Another element involves the recruitment by the NRA of its own in-house archaeological expertise which will advise the NRA on all archaeological aspects including cost control which is a major concern to the NRA and specifically to liaise with Duchás about technical aspects both on the programme in general and relating to specific projects. The last point is that an agreed code of practice could be rolled out to cover other sectors where development has major impacts on archaeology, for example, harbour developments with regard to underwater sites, water service and other public utility requirements and the CIF, including the Irish Home Builder's Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification. Is she happy that given the extra archaeologists she referred to in answering Deputy O'Shea's question, she will have sufficient staff to deal with as yet undiscovered sites in the road programme planned for the next six years? Is she happy that she will be able to put into effect the aspirations in the code of practice, which I share with her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would certainly be the intention. In order to deal with this there will be a need for more archaeologists and I intend to <Col N="75" /> ensure there are more archaeologists in the system to deal with future problems.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a low level of females in senior positions in my Department. My Department is an amalgamation of divisions transferred from other Departments and the ratio of senior females who transferred into the Department was indeed very low. I have no control over the appointments made by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission or by TLAC. We are mindful of the need to redress the balance and every effort is being made to do so by encouraging female staff to apply for promotion to the more senior positions as the vacancies arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. Given that female staff fill 17.5% of senior positions in her Department, does she agree that this position should be addressed by way of positive discrimi<Col N="76" /> nation in some form or other? The SMI report from which I received my information made recommendations such as monitoring recruitment. What is her view of that proposal and of ensuring that gender is not a factor in placement geographically or within the Department? Does the Minister agree that there appears to be a need to improve management skills generally in the Department? The low promotion rate among female staff indicates a deficit in this regard.</P>
      <P>The points I have made revolve around one issue &ndash; is this situation so bad it requires positive discrimination to address the imbalance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have no control over the appointments made by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission or TLAC. However, on the formation of the Department, staff were drawn from other Departments. The original Department of the Gaeltacht existed until 1993 and had one secretary and one assistant secretary, both male, and in January 1993 the arts and culture division and the broadcasting policy division transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Communications respectively to form the new Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. One male assistant secretary was assigned to the new Department. The heritage service was transferred from the Office of Public Works in 1996 and the current Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands was established, with one assistant secretary, also male, transferring from the Office of Public Works. I agree with the Deputy that there seems to be a deficit of females at the higher level of the Department, but I hope to see this trend reversed over time. My policy adviser, who was a principal officer in the civil service, is female.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and TLAC decide on these appointments and obviously proficiency in Irish plays an important role. It would be odd for anyone to state that it was less likely that one would find proficiency in Irish among female staff. There are other difficulties that should be addressed. I have no influence over the top positions &ndash; that is the business of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission or TLAC, but where I have influence I will do all I can to encourage female participation and I hope to see an improvement in female representation up the ranks of the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the FORTE task force recommended that a music board be established to promote and develop the indigenous music industry. I am pleased to advise that agreement has been reached with the music industry representatives under the auspices of IBEC to jointly fund a non-statutory Music Board of Ireland for an initial period of three years to further promote the industry. Discussions are continuing in relation to specific details about the establishment of the board. It is envisaged that the Music Board of Ireland will be in place by mid-summer 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the interim Music Board of Ireland is to act as a forum for the industry, to devise and actively promote strategic policies for the development of the music industry and the maximisation of its contribution to the national economy. It will also draw up proposals for legislation to establish the board on a statutory footing. I have indicated in reply to previous parliamentary questions on this matter that the issue of the provision of digital music libraries would best be considered within the framework of such a board. Once the Music Board of Ireland is in place its terms of reference will enable the provision of such a forum for the consideration of <Col N="78" /> issues such as the provision of digital music libraries.</P>

My question refers specifically to the digital library. Can I take it that, given the circumstances which now apply, setting up the board on an interim basis, which I welcome, leading to a statutory board by legislation, we are quite a distance away from the establishment of a library of digital music? How long does the Minister envisage the interim board being in place and when does she expect legal effect will be given to the establishment of a statutory board? Will its remit specifically include setting up a library such as was referred to in the Government plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage this non-statutory music board will be in place for three years. Part of its remit will be to consider the necessity for legislation to make it statutory. It is important to proceed with the establishment of the board because a good deal of work needs to be done, not least on the issue of digital libraries, to which the Deputy referred. I did not dream up this. Indepth research was conducted and the FORTE report recommended the establishment of a music board to promote the development of the indigenous music industry. It proposed a joint initiative between the Department and IBEC. This has been agreed and we are awaiting the conclusion of the final considerations. The music board should be in operation by mid-summer this year. It will be responsible for dealing with the issues in our programme for Government. This is another commitment in the programme for Government which has been delivered on by this Department.</P>

To allay the fears of the Opposition, £150,000 has been made available in the Department's 2000 Estimate. The Exchequer portion will not be more than 50% of the board's budget in any given year. The IBEC music industry group put forward certain names for chairman and consult with me. I will then decide on the appointment of chairman. As regards chairs of music in universities, we must ensure this initiative promotes music commercially rather than academically. I do not believe, therefore, that the input of universities to which the Deputy referred will be an appropriate matter for the music board. <Col N="79" /> However, that will be for the members of the board to decide when it is up and running.</P>

      <P>Financial allocations and resources are reviewed each year in the context of the preparation of business plans and the annual of estimates for my Department. Within Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, the annual financial allocations are made on a region by region, rather than a park by park basis. Staff requirements are continually under review and I am pleased to say that, following one such review, 38 additional conservation rangers were recruited in recent months by my Department to serve throughout the country. External reviews are often carried out by my Department in regard to proposals involving significant expenditure on particular projects in national parks. The following are some recent illustrations of such reviews.</P>
      <P>RPS Cairns consultants carried out a review in 1997 of visitor facilities at Muckross House in Killarney National Park which recommended an expansion of visitor facilities at Muckross House to cope with the expanding number of visitors to the national park. I accepted the recommendation to expand the visitor facilities and allocated more than £2.5 million Exchequer funding to the development of the walled garden complex which is being co-financed by the trustees of Muckross House in the amount of £750,000. It must be appreciated that this level of investment relates to a site visited by more than 286,000 visitors who purchased tickets and a greater number who availed of the free-to-visitor facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>O'Muire Smyth reported in 1996 on the development of a national park in north west Mayo and recommended the development of visitor facilities there. Under the recently published national development plan I have allocated £3 million Exchequer funding for the development of a visitor centre at Ballycroy. In relation to the Wicklow Mountains National Park, Dúchas officials are currently working with Wicklow County Council and the Glendalough and District Development Association on a visitor management project for Glendalough. The project is being financed by the EU, Wicklow County Council and my Department. A comprehensive <Col N="80" /> internal review of visitor facilities at Glenveagh National Park is being carried out at present.</P>
    <P>Visitor facilities at all national parks are subject to ongoing review. In relation to the quality of presentation and visitor experience at visitor centres, Dúchas has commissioned market research on a biennial basis in the past. This research indicated high levels of satisfaction among visitors to Dúchas sites. In 1999 a more comprehensive survey of visitor attitudes to facilities and services at Dúchas sites was carried out. The results of this detailed research will be used to develop a more sophisticated system for evaluating the quality of visitor experiences at all Dúchas sites in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. I am rapporteur on the national park issue for the committee. I hope that when my report is produced, it will be of some assistance to the Department. I support the expenditure on Muckross House and Ballycroy. We have no legislation governing our national parks, except for the Bourn Vincent Act which covers half of Killarney National Park. Will this issue be reinstated on the legislative agenda? Will the Minister ensure that I receive a copy of the 1999 comprehensive report on visitors facilities? National parks have become a commercial entity and given the changes in Irish life, the experience offered to visitors should be of world-class standard. The updating and refreshment of the image of the national parks is necessary in many cases.</P>
      <P>Other than the Great Blasket to which the Minister referred earlier, is it intended to make any other areas national parks, perhaps in smaller units? Is the Minister happy with the category in which our national parks are placed, in accordance with the world definition of national parks? Some of these are described as wilderness areas where there should be no sign of human habitation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for compiling a report, which he hopes will be of help to the Department. I look forward to its publication. On national parks legislation, the Deputy will be aware that we have prioritised the drafting of a national heritage plan, which is coming to fruition. Many submissions were made by interested individuals and groups and these will be the basis of work in the future. Such a plan was necessary. Priority has been given to the drafting of a national heritage plan rather than to legislation on national parks. However, when the plan is implemented, we can proceed to draft legislation.</P>
      <P>I will make the 1999 report available to the Deputy. As the Blasket Islands were mentioned already, I need not revisit the matter. I am happy with the national parks category.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy has any particular concerns on this, I will be happy to hear from him.</P>

      <P>The works at Parkavera Lock, Galway, estimated to cost £100,000, will be completed by the end of September 2000. The Deputy will be aware that Parkavera Lock comes under the control of the Corrib navigation trustees. As the canal was not within my jurisdiction, it was decided to carry out the scheme using the Office of Public Works, which, as project manager, has powers to carry out such works.</P>
      <P>Following detailed discussion between the parties, the trustees endorsed the enhancement scheme in June 1999 and they obtained planning permission for same in December 1999. Detailed structural design is being carried out by Office of Public Works and shortly the tenders will be invited for the works involved.</P>

      <P>Would I be right in thinking that the discussions between the Office of Public Works, Galway Corporation and the Corrib navigation trustees took place as far back as 1997? Would I be correct also in stating that the Corrib navigation trustees indicated their assent almost two years ago? As the Minister of State indicated that the work was expected to be finished initially before the end of 1998 and then in 1999, what confidence can we have that the work will be completed by September 2000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting between the Office of Public Works architect, my Department and one of the trustees who is also an engineer took place on 17 June 1998. The final agreement on the elements of the scheme was reached on 22 June 1998. A drawing and sketch of the proposed works was forwarded to the trustees on 24 February 1999 for their informal approval and agreement to secure the necessary planning permission and to bear any maintenance cost associated with the proposal. The trustees formally endorsed the proposals and conditions in June 1999. Drawings for planning permission and submission were forwarded to the trustees and permission was applied for in September 1999. Final grant of permission was received on 17 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the structural design section of the Office of Public Works is carrying out detailed design work. The tenders will be invited shortly to fabricate the various elements, supply materials and carry out the work. After sourcing the materials, six to eight weeks will be required for fabrication. Thereafter, a further four to five weeks will be required for on-site work. It is expected that the work will be completed by September 2000.</P>

Can she confirm that the funding of £100,000 is secure, given that it was initially allocated out of the Structural Funds for the period 1994 to 1999?</P>
      <P>The Parkavera Lock was but part of the general scheme, as designed. The original design, as I understand it, included, for example, an examination of the stonework of the canal and the recovery of the stones and their replacement in the canal beyond the lock.

That is why the Office of Public Works, as project manager, had the powers to carry out such works on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>The work is going ahead and, therefore, the £100,000 is available to the project. I do not have the detail on the Deputy's second question but I can find out that information for the Deputy and I will make him aware of it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the west Cork arts centre and the work being done. Early last year I met representatives of the centre, as the Deputy will recall, when their arts in transition scheme was discussed. I am pleased to note that the work of the centre is being supported by the Arts Council, which has made provision for more than £100,000 in revenue grant aid for the year 2000 for the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her friendly response to the people from the west Cork arts centre when they came to see her, but I want to raise, in particular, the arts in transition course, which is a good course. It involved a pilot project for more than 1,000 pupils over the past three years and funding of £80,000, most of which was raised privately &ndash; £20,000 of it was UNESCO money received <i>via</i> the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about whether the Minister will support the continuation of that project, which is due to expire in a couple of months. My real concern is that it tends to fall between her Department and the Department of Education and Science. I am particularly anxious that the Minister would speak with her colleague in <Col N="83" /> the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the necessary funding will be put in place to continue that transition course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks. I agree with him that this is a matter which is falling between the Departments to which he referred. My Department does not have the powers to implement some of the changes which the Deputy would like to see. It is very much in the realm of education, but I would be happy to speak to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, on this matter. Perhaps we might be able to arrange for a deputation from the group to which the Deputy referred, to see him because, as the Deputy will be aware, there is a working group, which was set up between the Department of Education and Science and my Department, and this could be one of the issues for discussion. I certainly agree that the work, which is being done there, should continue.</P>
      <P>On another hopeful aspect, this scheme was not successful under the old CDIS funding, but the Deputy may be aware that soon I will announce a capital programme to replace the CDIS funding, which was mainly under the Operational Programme for Tourism and which was European money. European money is no longer available. I want to put a capital programme of Exchequer funding in place because the work which was done under the CDIS funding was important in building up an infrastructure for the arts, galleries and museums throughout the country and I wish to see that continue. It may be an opportunity for this centre to put forward a proposal, once the details and application forms are available.</P>

      <P>On the task force between the Department of Education and Science and the Minister's Department, it is important to bridge that gap. I suggest, because of the work of this centre, a representative of the centre be appointed to that task force. The centre has the experience of trying to bridge that gap and it may have something practical to offer to the work of the task force. Perhaps the Minister might also have a word with her colleague in the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the CDIS scheme, which involved about £32 million. There were applications for projects under the <Col N="84" /> scheme totalling about £87 million and the Department had to choose one in three of the applications. Did I understand the Minister to have stated that there is not a succeeding structure of funding for an extension of that programme and she proposes to do it exclusively from Exchequer funding? If that is the case, why is there not additional European funding, for example, to bridge the gap between £32 million and £87 million which would be for projects already evaluated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy O'Keeffe's question, I have promised to take on board this issue regarding discussions with the Minister for Education and Science. The Deputy can be assured that it will be one of the issues which will be discussed at the interdepartmental group. I will let the Deputy know of any further discussions and of their outcome.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Higgins, he is perfectly right in saying that the CDIS funding, which was under the Operational Programme for Tourism, was only from 1994 to 1999 and, of course, like all these projects not all applicants were successful. That programme was very useful and important in ensuring there was an infrastructure. There is no comparable EU project to follow on from it and so there will be no gap. I have ensured funding for a capital programme which I will be announcing within a week or two.</P>

I am pleased, however, to inform the Deputy that as a result of my meetings with US film industry leaders, the Screen Commission of Ireland is pursuing a number of positive lines of inquiry from Hollywood producers and studios who are considering Ireland as a location for productions scheduled for filming within the next 18 months to two years.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the action she will take to properly protect our archaeological heritage in view of the report by the Heritage Council that our national monuments are being destroyed at the rate of 10% every year.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Heritage Council's recent report on archaeological features at risk indicates there is a destruction rate in archaeological sites of 10% every ten years and not 10% per annum as the Deputy suggests. I have welcomed the publication of this report as it brings a new focus to the problem of the destruction of archaeological monuments, which has been a source of concern to me and to the archaeological survey of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I previously acknowledged that this problem exists, notwithstanding the significant legislative powers which are available to me. I am currently <Col N="86" /> looking at means by which the services provided by my Department's conservation rangers in the ecological field could be extended to include some monitoring of archaeological sites as well as a repositioning of the archaeological services in my Department so as to provide a more localised service that brings it closer to those heritage sites that we are endeavouring to preserve and protect. In addition, I am exploring means by which local authorities would assume an enhanced role in the protection of the archaeological heritage at a local level while I also see scope in developing alliances with other local interest groups whereby they could assist in keeping a watch over archaeological sites and monuments at local level. These are initiatives which I intend to explore further in consultation with the Heritage Council in the context of the proposed national heritage plan which I will be circulating later this year.</P>
    <P>I emphasise, however, that all known archaeological sites and monuments have been entered in the record of monuments established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. Notice of the publication of the record for each county has been given in the local newspapers and copies of the record are available in public libraries, local authority planning offices and certain Teagasc offices. Landowners should, if they have not already done so, check the record to see if any recorded monuments are on their land as they are required to give two months written notification to Dúchas prior to carrying out works at or in relation to a recorded monument.</P>
    <P>I also see the need for better education and public awareness, which I am constantly striving to achieve through various initiatives, including an annual heritage newsletter to all primary schools in the country. This and other initiatives will be pursued further in the context of the heritage plan. The plan will also be concentrating on initiatives to provide better training for all those who work for the protection of heritage to ensure they are equipped with sufficient levels of knowledge and practical training to allow them carry out their roles to the greatest advantage.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the principal legislative protection for archaeological sites and monuments is contained in the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994. Notices were placed in the main national newspapers on 15 November 1999 inviting submissions from interested parties in relation to a proposed review of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, and related legislation.</P>
    <P>As the public consultation phase of the review is now complete, it is my intention that the review will lead to the drafting of consolidated and, where appropriate, revised and extended legislation for the protection of the archaeological, architectural, and historic heritage.</P>
    <P>I am confident that through these various measures the destruction of our archaeological sites can be arrested and hopefully will be substantially eliminated in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is 10% every ten years, but is it not disastrous that our archaeological heritage is being destroyed every day of the week, something which is well known? Builders and farmers carrying out reclamation and drainage works are destroying our heritage every day and nothing is being done about it. Last summer I raised a case with the Minister in the House about which she was unaware, namely, the destruction of a very ancient building in Clonmacnoise. A farmer was prosecuted in this case, the only prosecution I have seen in the past ten or 15 years. What is the Minister doing? Is there any will to do something about it? Does the Minister have the manpower to ensure these sites are protected or, as indicated by the Heritage Council, is this a total disaster in terms of our archaeological heritage?</P>

      <P>We acknowledge that there are difficulties which must be faced immediately. That is why I am examining the possibility of extending the role of my Department's conservation rangers in the ecological field to include some monitoring of archaeological sites. I am also examining how local authorities can assume an enhanced role in the protection of our archaeological heritage. Of course, the national heritage plan will be published and I will be working on initiatives with the Heritage Council, which plays an important consultative part in terms of the national heritage plan.</P>
      <P>Education, of course, is perhaps the most important aspect of this and better education and public awareness about the need to protect our heritage is necessary. That is why I am constantly striving to see how we can implement further initiatives in this regard, not least through the annual heritage newsletter which is sent to all primary schools. The National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, need to be reviewed and, again, I have taken the opportunity to do this under the national heritage plan. We can ascertain whether further legislation is needed to strengthen this area.</P>

      <P>There is a difference between these amendments. Amendment No. 5 is closely related to amendment No. 1, though I sought to have the following wording inserted between lines 25 and 26:</P>

      <P>I do not intend to waste time by rehearsing all the arguments on that again, but this amendment would insert a similar wording in a different paragraph. &ldquo;An act of sexual abuse&rdquo; is defined in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 2000, and the insertion of a new definition in this legislation is a case of reinventing the wheel.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 20, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a temporary residential setting,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I drafted this amendment to take account of a limitation in the legislation. Section 1(1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;institution' includes a school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital, a children's home and any other place where children are cared for other than as members of their families;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A residence is established in the sense of where one stays or lives, but a person could be taken out for the day or taken to work. A case was brought to my attention, for example, where a lay member of an adoption society took a child out to work. I am just anxious to secure the extension of this definition to include all places even if they are just temporary residential settings. We discussed this to some extent on Committee Stage in terms of taking children away for weekends to camps or on temporary holidays. The aim of the amendment is to address that scenario. The Minister suggested that he would devise a wording of his own which would give me some security in terms of the proposal in my amendment. I am anxious to hear from him in that regard.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Higgins. The Bill, as drafted, will establish a commission to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions and it is important that it should cover other locations at which they were placed while under the care of the institution, whether temporary residence or trips. The Deputy has raised an important issue, which requires clarification. I also recall the Minister signalling on Committee Stage that he would give sympathetic consideration to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree that the issues raised in the amendment must be covered by the commission. This was always my intention and the current wording was prepared with this in my mind. I undertook on Committee Stage to re-examine this issue and I am satisfied the wording covers all situations and, in the circumstances, the proposed amendments would not add to the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for inquiring into abuse by any person committed in an institution &ndash; this includes people who work in the institution, visitors or others &ndash; and abuse of a person outside the <Col N="90" /> institution by a person involved in the operation of the institution or associated in any way with the institution. The Deputy will note that amendment No. 11 will further address the issue he has raised by including anyone associated with an institution.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 11 as it covers the person or the agent. I am anxious, however, that there is an assurance regarding the setting, which is very important. Amendments Nos. 9 to 11 deal with a person or agent whereas these amendments deal with the setting. My concern was that the construction of the term &ldquo;residence&rdquo; could be interpreted in terms of primary residence, usual residence or whatever. I want to be absolutely sure that even for short periods of time the residence where the child found himself or herself was included. If the Minister tells me that his advice is that the Bill is unequivocal in this regard, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 42, after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a person associated or connected with the institution who had any measure of control or authority over a child resident or formerly resident in the institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to address a situation involving a rather sad case which was brought to my attention in the course of preparation for this legislation. It was one where a very young child was taken out to work by a lay member of an adoption society on the assumption that the nuns would be too close to the child and, therefore, the lay person was better able to handle the situation. It is vitally important that we have a clear assurance on this aspect. The crucial words in the amendment are &ldquo;measure of control or authority&rdquo;. The case I mentioned is one in which the person could claim a kind of authority which I would suggest, in some circumstances made known to me, was abused. In that sense our difficulty with the original Bill, even on Committee Stage, related to one hand being involved in the management, operation, employment procedures or whatever and that it did not deal with the volunteered sector as it interfaced with the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 10 is similar to my amendment. The Minister has suggested, and we will hear from him when he moves his own amendment, that my concerns are met by the words &ldquo;associated with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My separate amendment No. 12 includes the words &ldquo;or a person who enjoyed access to the institution&rdquo;. This was to deal with other circumstances such as those which may have been drawn to my attention. For example, a person &ldquo;in association with&rdquo;, as the Minister would have it, might be constructed formally as this person who was involved in an adoption society or whatever but a person who had access could be a person who was in another voluntary capacity but one which was not recognised formally. The purpose of these amendments was to cover all cases of access to the child. Amendment No. 9 covers the formal connections and amendment No. 12 covers people who, for example, might not be in such a formal association with a person who had a right of access or visit. A person arriving, say, to take a child out to work would not have an association in any formal sense with the institution but would have the practice of visiting the institution. The purpose of amendment No. 12 is to cover that situation and that is the distinction between that amendment and amendment No. 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment which was drawn to my attention by a person who was placed to work on a farm while in an orphanage. The issue revolves around who had responsibility in that case for placing the child in a situation where it is alleged that abuse took place. Clearly it is important that the commission encompasses a case such as that and, like Deputy Higgins, I am not sure what &ldquo;associated with&rdquo; will mean in practical terms if we write it into the Bill as an alternative version, as the Minister suggests. It is important that if the institution, consciously or unconsciously, assented, any placement of the child would be open to investigation. This aspect can be resolved in the Minister's response if he gives a clear definition of the intention in his amendment and the type of cases where it will come into play. More particularly, will the sort of case Deputy Higgins described be encompassed by the Minister's amendment if we agree to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments relates to a concern expressed on Committee Stage that the legislation might not cover individuals who may have committed abuse on children in the care of an institution, though not in the institution itself, who have no formal attachment with the institution but are instead merely associated with it. I undertook to consider that on Committee Stage and I am not proposing amendment No. 11 which will broaden the scope of the Bill to ensure that not only does it cover persons employed by, managing or administering an institution but also persons associated with an institution. I hope this <Col N="92" /> broadening will meet the Deputies' concerns in amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 12. It covers persons associated in any way, and the kinds of situations described by the Deputies are really some form of association. If someone is working on a farm, there is an association in the accepted legal term. If a voluntary body is involved, there is an association in that sense too. On the other hand, if somebody from outside comes into the institution, they are also covered under visitors, etc.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 4, after &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;funded,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the section dealing with the responsibilities of the State. This amendment was introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage. The current wording in the Bill refers to effected, supervised, regulated, in whole or in part, by a Department of State, vocational education committee, health board, local authority or any other public body. The issue that has arisen in the course of discussion of the issue of child abuse generally in institutions was the extent to which the State was responsible, not only through its duty to regulate and supervise but also through its duty to adequately fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the wording the Minister offered in his Committee Stage amendment overlooks the issue of funding. The words used in the amendment are &ldquo;effected, supervised or regulated, in whole or in part, by a Department of State&rdquo;. My interpretation of a word such as &ldquo;effected&rdquo; would not necessarily imply that the funding was included and it could refer to a situation where the State operated an institution. However, where institutions are not run by the State it seems that those responsible for their operation are effecting the management and <Col N="93" /> administration of the centre. Therefore, to make it clear that we also intend to investigate the adequacy of the funding provided by the State in relation to voluntary organisations which are operating institutions of care, we should include the word &ldquo;funded&rdquo;. That is the purpose of amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 relates to a slightly different matter. Under the Children Act, 1908, the State established a system whereby children could be placed in the care of certain institutions. These children were taken from their parents, often for no reason of crime, delinquency, etc., on their part either because their parents were poor or because someone frowned on their lifestyle arrangements. The amendment the Minister put forward on Committee Stage, while it is undoubtedly an advance, does not seem to clarify whether the system under which a child was taken from its parents and placed in the care of an institution where it was subsequently abused is being adequately investigated.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that problems arose in this area because children were not represented in court cases involving them. In many instances even the parents were not kept properly informed regarding what was taking place and their right to participate. As a result the system conspired against the interests of children and they were not adequately protected when a decision of such enormous importance to their future was being made. It is for that reason amendment No. 14 explicitly states that the system of placement in an institution by a public body, whether it be a court or otherwise, should come under scrutiny in the course of the commission's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the Deputy's points carefully. My concern in this section was to make clear that the remit of the commission covers all institutions where children were cared for, both those administered by the State and those in the non-State sector. I have now made that explicit. My understanding of the Deputy's amendments is that he is trying to place this even further beyond doubt. I assure him that these amendments are not necessary. The current wording of section 3 embraces both of the points made in his amendments, namely, the funding of institutions and the role of public bodies in placing children into care. In fact, the wording goes much further by simply providing that all aspects of the work of the public bodies &ndash; operation, management, regulation and supervision &ndash; should be open to scrutiny. In light of this already comprehensive and broad definition, I do not believe it is necessary to include any further elaboration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of funding is dealt with in terms of the supervision and regulation, namely, how the supervision was carried out and how State, semi-State or other bodies discharged their duties in caring for children. In my opinion we have covered this point. I understand Deputy Bruton's <Col N="94" /> concerns but I am advised that the point has been comprehensively covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek an assurance from the Minister on a particular point. Let us consider the situation which obtained in a case outlined to Deputies in the course of their preparation for this debate where the members of a family, some of whom were as young as four or five years of age, were obliged to stand in court and wait for it to make an order which would possibly split them up and allocate them to different institutions. That represents a process and, arising from what he has just stated, will the Minister provide an assurance that that said process comes within the remit of the commission? This is an extraordinarily important point because decisions can often be taken which lead to the institutionalisation of mere infants, a matter with which the Bill deals in detail. Is the Minister in a position to provide an assurance in that regard? Such an assurance might influence my attitude to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was very economical and I am not clear about what he said. However, my interpretation of his comments is that supervision includes funding. A layman would not interpret the term &ldquo;supervision&rdquo; in that way. If most people were asked the nature of the Department of Education and Science's supervisory role, they would state that it involves the visits its officials might make on occasion, the inspectorate it might put in place and the reports it acts upon. Funding is a separate issue and involves the extent to which adequate resources are provided by the State to support various activities in the institution in question. I do not believe funding is automatically or logically contemplated by the word &ldquo;supervision&rdquo;. These terms are not defined under the section which deals with definitions and, therefore, we are not in a position to clarify what is meant by supervision.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Higgins, I am not satisfied that the Minister has dealt with the issue of the process under which children were placed in institutions. We know from the evidence that only 5% of children who were placed in institutions had been found to be involved in delinquent behaviour of any sort. The vast majority were brought before the courts for institutionalisation without any evidence to prove they had been involved in wrongdoing. It was simply a case that someone had decided that these children were not being reared in a satisfactory home. In many instances, the definition of the term &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; was not robust and it would not be acceptable in current circumstances. It was merely a case that people did not approve of the lifestyle of the parents of many of these children. However, that did not necessarily mean that these children were being reared in unsafe or unsound homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children in question were brought before the courts, they were not represented in the vast <Col N="95" /> majority of cases and crucial decisions were made about their care. We know that, sadly, many of those decisions led to the children having terrible experiences while in institutional care. Before we conclude our deliberations on this matter, the Minister must provide clear and categorical confirmation that the issues to which I refer are dealt with under the section. We must be in a position to do more than take the matter on faith, the Minister must supply a definition over which he can stand &ndash; on the basis of legal or other advice &ndash; to the effect that these words mean what he presents them as meaning. A layman reading the section would not see it in the way outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is basically seeking an account of what was done or information on how the work was carried out. In that sense, the money or funding that was expended is included. What we need to consider is the amount of money involved and the way in which it was expended, which comes under the headings of supervision and management. I am assured that this is covered. To satisfy the Deputies, I could include the word &ldquo;funded&rdquo; although it will be different from the wording in Deputy Bruton's amendment. I propose that in line 4 of page 5 after &ldquo;supervised&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, funded&rdquo;. The phrase would then read &ldquo;administration, operation, supervision or regulation effected, supervised, funded or regulated&rdquo;. If there is agreement, I will make that amendment. It will make it more explicitly clear.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins asked about the court and somebody waiting in court. We are not entitled to interfere with the judicial process in the courts. That is a separate area. Obviously, if the child was held in an institution when going to or from court or while the court was sitting, it would be included. However, the process in the court is a matter for the courts and the judicial process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Once the judge is behaving within the Courts Acts it is a judicial matter. That is ring-fenced. However, consider a situation where a group of orphans are rounded up and brought into the court by a garda. Some of them might be four or five years of age and they are scattered to different institutions. My argument is that the judicial process has not commenced properly in that case. I am discussing the business of collecting and scattering the children. That is not a judicial process but a policy issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I am saving myself from being provoked into considering what judges should or should not do in relation to many of these institutions. They were in a unique position, better than many of the visiting committees. They could visit any of these institutions at the drop of a hat, something a Member of the Oireachtas or a visiting committee could not do. How many of the judges did it? That can be left for history to judge.</P>
    <P>The treatment of children who were either deprived of their parents or whose parents were &ldquo;found deficient&rdquo; in some way is something for which the process has not begun. The other part is that what their lordships on the bench would be deciding at that stage would be something under the 1908 Act. However, there was nothing in that Act which gave them jurisdiction. If the system was arbitrary, improper and loose, why should the commission not look at it? Some of the people who are interested in appearing before the commission and who are in communication with me and other Deputies have a most traumatic memory of their day in court. They were guilty of nothing, five or six years old and waiting to be told what was to happen to them. That is not a judicial decision, rather it is an issue regarding the institutionalised care of children.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to interfere with what their eminences decided when the bench properly executed its duties. I am more interested in what was happening at the periphery.</P>

      <P>What is excluded from consideration by the commission must be kept to a minimum. Whether a child was adequately represented before the court is worthy of investigation. The decision of the court on the evidence as presented cannot be revisited except on appeal. However, we are seeking an assurance that the cover of what is excluded in the court will not be thrown so wide as to exclude the entire process whereby the children were brought before the court without adequate representation or proper scrutiny of why they were there in the first place.</P>

      <P>The commission will not review the decision of the court. It will review the circumstances leading to and following the decision but it will not review the judicial process in making its decision at the time. It can probably point to the laws that operated at the time and to the other circumstances. However, the decision in individual cases will not be open to review by the commission.</P>
      <P>There will be an opportunity for people to express their views about what happened, why they were there, how they came before the courts, how trivial the original complaint or alleged offence was and how they were ultimately treated. That information will come out in the report but the decision made by the judge in an individual case will not be subject to review in this process.</P>

      <P>Nobody wants to undo or reflect upon the decision of the judge <i>per se</i>. However, let us say a group of children who have been orphaned are before the court. What if the judge decides, as happened in one case, on the basis of the children's ages? Pointing to a child he asked his age and on hearing it said: &ldquo;He goes to X institution&rdquo;. He then proceeded to the next child and the family was split up. The issue of the division of the siblings is a policy issue in child care. The issue the judge decided on is placing them in care by utilising such power as he or she, being the judge, has. Is the Minister saying that the judge's decision in the judicial process is <Col N="98" /> intact, but that the policy decisions that preceded, surrounded and are consequential to it are also included? I refer to the case I have mentioned because it will arise later. The decision to break up a number of siblings and put them into different institutions may be on foot of the same order. I do not contest the order about placing them in care, but I raise the policy issue of dividing the family.</P>

      <P>I understood from Committee Stage that the judicial process was included. I am confident the Minister gave such an assurance at that Stage. It is something of a shock to me to find that these decisions cannot be looked at as part of a review. I thought they undoubtedly would be looked at. We have seen judges make manifestly wrong decisions in the past and I do not see why a review of this kind would not also look at that issue. If a wrong decision was made to commit a child it raises the question of liability, on the State and on any institution involved.</P>
      <P>What statute law prevents the commission from considering the whole process, from beginning to end, of where a child was taken from its family and ended up in an institution? I did not understand an area was ring-fenced to prevent the commission addressing it. The lack of representation for children was wrong and that could not be ring-fenced against inquiry on the basis that it was acceptable. It should be properly within the remit of the commission.</P>
      <P>We are only trying to find matters of fact in the commission. It will not rule on liability or whatever, so I do not see why a section of the process should be ring-fenced in this way. That was not my understanding from Committee Stage. I am not a lawyer, so I do not know if we are treading on profound constitutional waters by suggesting that wrong decisions should be reviewed by the commission. However, I would like to see them reviewed and following from that, perhaps the commission could ascertain the causes of them, whether it be in the representation the child received, the way the cases were presented or whatever.</P>

However, I am not satisfied with the Minster's outline of the precise reason this cannot be done. Referring to the separation of powers is one thing, but a member of the Judiciary is conducting the inquiry, it is not being conducted by the Legislature, so I do not understand the Minister's argument and am not convinced by it. Nevertheless, I accept he has received legal advice which is the basis for his advice to the House.</P>

Where the Minister intends to allow submissions on behalf of those who have been victims of abuse, does he also intend to facilitate some of the bodies who approached the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science who were equally anxious that there would be opportunities to make submissions. Balance would appear to require that the possibility of making submissions should apply to all quarters. Has the Minister been conscious of that need for balance in his amendments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Bruton is important and requires clarification. In making submissions or in giving oral account of abuse suffered, there are a number of survivors or victims of abuse in respect of whom existing files and information exist which may be traceable through the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or individual health boards depending on how they came to be in a specific institution. Will the Minister clarify if he envisages that they will be given access to documentation which relates either to themselves, which is held in the records of Departments or residential homes, or to the institution in which they were cared for during the time they were in <Col N="101" /> care? In the context of their having gained access to that information, will they be able to make submissions to contradict statements which may be contained in such documentation?</P>
      <P>The concern in this issue is that people in charge of certain institutions may have referred in background files or diaries to some of those who were the victims of both physical and sexual abuse in a manner they regarded as justifying using violence towards those victims and which may have been inaccurate. I know a trawl of records is ongoing and there is a concern to clarify to what extent an individual will have access to those records in advance of a hearing before a committee of the commission and to what extent he or she will be able to make an advance submission on what is contained in those records and to contradict it if the records are untrue. Will the Minister clarify that in the context of the amendment to which he refers?</P>

      <P>Section 4(5) covers the question of submissions and is open and broad on that: &ldquo;The Commission may invite or receive oral or written submissions&rdquo;. There is no limit. Regarding Deputy Shatter's point about files in Departments, as the Deputy knows from his experience, many files are now provided and a search is ongoing through some 40,000 files. This is being done by an archivist and the information is being provided. People will have access to the files they want and which relate to them. The issue of institutions is one for the commission. If it grants access to their files, then those will be available. I believe the commission will be open about that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 10, after &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the role of the State or any of its organs (including the Minister, his or her Department and the courts)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment. Those who made representations following the decision to establish the commission made a number of points. One of those has already been covered by Deputy Bruton and it concerned people having the right to make submissions as well as appearances. I agree with him that old people who find themselves interacting with the commission should do so on a basis of equality of treatment and fairness. I hope that will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment allows the State to be investigated. When I tabled it, I had in mind a defence which I already noticed being made following public discussion of abuse. It was along the lines that the people involved were doing their best in conditions where the State did not accept its <Col N="102" /> responsibilities and at a time when insufficient funds were available. The only way the rest of the work of the commission can be saved from that type of generalised defence is by including the State and its organs in the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already granted the term &ldquo;funding&rdquo; regarding an administrative dimension. I propose to include the words &ldquo;and the role of the State or any of its organs (including the Minister, his or her Department and the courts)&rdquo;. The last item does not interfere with that which is proper to a judicial decision. It merely concerns the role of the courts or the territory they occupied in this matter. The appearance of orphans in courts for a decision to be made on which institution would take them and whether they would be broken up, scattered or allocated to different institutions is a social fact rather than part of a legal decision. There is a distinction between a legal process and a judicial process and these decisions were more concerned with a legalistic ethos rather than legal texts under which a judicial decision would be made.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton is perhaps more specific than mine. I included the role of the State and its organs, including the Minister, his or her Department and the courts. Put simply, the only way the rest of the work of the commission will be thorough is by stating that it will not examine matters in a partial sense but will examine everything. If that is done, it will be to its advantage. I say this because the defence is already emerging and has entered the popular realm about how the abuses were few, the good was great, the State did nothing, the funding was inadequate and it was great that they did what they did. I do not say that that is true but that is the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>That defence will be heard repeatedly for several years unless we say that, if the commission is to examine duties of care, their abuse and breaches of trust, it will also examine the policy ethos in which these issues arose. The policy ethos includes the legislative atmosphere of the time and the willingness or reluctance to introduce legislation which would protect children. The long gap following the 1908 Act is an example I would give in that regard. There must also be an examination in terms of the organs of the State. Was it right to make orphans appear before the courts and for matters relating to them to be decided in a courtroom atmosphere?</P>
    <P>I was disturbed about some of the discussion which followed the Kennedy case regarding the attitude to inspection. It seems it is possible for those who acted in an atmosphere of lax or no inspection to say inspectors were not present. The only way of dealing with that is by examining those whose responsibility it was to provide the inspection. Every other area of scrutiny gains by the torch being shone on everything. This amendment provides that the State is not exempt from any consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, to a large extent, had this debate on the earlier amendment when we dealt with section 1(3) and I will not rehearse those arguments. It is important the principle be established that we do not-ring fence any part of the process except that which is required in respecting the constitutional right of a judge in court. That is very important. The State had many responsibilities along the way, as we saw from the documentation laid before the committee. I await the Minister's response, although I suspect he will repeat what he said in regard to the earlier section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the commission cannot set itself up to effectively review decisions made by the courts but one of the concerns in this area is that as a consequence of court decisions children were inappropriately placed in institutional care, possibly due to the fact that the courts lacked the adequate assessment and back-up facilities to enable them to make appropriate decisions as to how children with family difficulties should be dealt with. That is a relevant issue which the Minister may tell us can be dealt with under the management and administrative provisions relating to children in care. I am not sure it can because it relates to a decision made prior to a child being placed in an institution which may have been inappropriate.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue because it does not only affect decisions made in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. As matters stand in the year 2000, the probation and welfare service is grossly understaffed and lacks the capacity across a broad range of child care and family issues to provide the resources necessary to carry out essential assessments which District Court judges request to facilitate them in making considered decisions on how to deal with particular children in difficulty, children in respect of whom care applications are made or where there are custody disputes. The Laffoy commission may have a valuable contribution to make in that context, albeit that part of the problem simply derives from a lack of Government commitment and resources to ensure that the courts have the type of probation and welfare and child care services required to facilitate judges, who essentially only have legal training and expertise, to determine in the best interests of a child how to address a particular family difficulty or difficulty with regard to the care of an individual child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments deal with the question of the role of the State in relation to the care of the children and the role of the commission in investigating that role. I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage in which I provided a clear and explicit statement that the commission will be empowered to consider the role of vocational education committees, health boards, local authorities and Departments, not only in relation to their operation and management but also in regard to their regulation. This is a far-<Col N="104" /> reaching and broad statement which I am satisfied will give the commission the necessary authority to undertake its task in a complete and comprehensive fashion.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage and again today, Deputies raised the possibility of investigating the role of the courts through the commission. It is not my intention that this should occur. The explicit separation of powers provided for in the Constitution means that it is doubtful in any case whether the Oireachtas could legislate for such a provision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter raised the issue of children being inappropriately placed because places were not available or because information was not made available to the courts in advance. Such a situation could, I believe, be included but the decisions of the court would be precluded. Any deficits in terms of the approach to the courts or available facilities would be open to investigation in so far as the commission might consider that such investigation was necessary. Section 4 is very broad-ranging. Section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) states:</P>
      <P>without prejudice to the generality of any of the foregoing, to determine the extent to which&ndash;</P>
      <P>(I)the institutions themselves in which such abuse occurred,</P>
      <P>(II)the systems of management, administration, operation, supervision, inspection and regulation of such institutions, and</P>
      <P>(III)the manner in which those functions were performed by the persons or bodies in whom they were vested,</P>
      <P>contributed to the occurrence or incidence of such abuse.</P>
      <P>The general circumstances in which an abuse occurred are therefore comprehensively covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister. The legislation does not seem to envisage the commission being in a position to examine the capacity of the courts as they then were or as they are now to determine the appropriate manner in which to address issues affecting the future care of a child. I am not talking about reviewing an individual decision made by an individual judge, rather about the capacity of the courts in regard to the manner in which they are structured and in regard to the back-up resources with which they are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister is familiar with the report published by the Law Reform Commission which recommended a radical reform of the court system in the area of family law and proposed the establishment of a family court system. The commission's report trenchantly criticised the failure of Government to implement a family court structure with the necessary professional back-up. The report was published five years ago but few, if any, of its recommendations have been implemented. If the Laffoy commission were <Col N="105" /> requested to consider the courts' capacities as they were in the past and are currently, I expect it would again highlight the huge gaps previously identified by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The only reason the Minister is excluding this issue &ndash; and I think he is being disingenuous in suggesting it is included &ndash; is that the Government does not want the publication of an up-to date report on the capacity of our courts to address issues in regard to child welfare. The courts did not have adequate capacities in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and it is disgraceful that in the year 2000, they are still crying out for back-up services which, to date, the Government has not been prepared to fund or provide.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 17, to delete &ldquo;a report&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;reports&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following our discussion on Committee Stage, I have provided for an amendment to the Bill to meet Deputies' concerns. Essentially, the Deputies' amendments sought to provide that the commission would report on an interim basis in advance of its final report.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that there are significant accountability and transparency issues here and I have provided for the thrust of these amendments in my amendments. Amendment No. 21 broadens the functions of the commission to recognise that it will make reports rather than a single report. Amendments Nos. 45 and 50 provide a like provision in relation to the investigative and confidential committees. Amendment No. 32 provides that the commission shall prepare an interim report not later than one year after its establishment and may prepare such other reports as it deems necessary. Amendments Nos. 46 and 51 provide for similar provisions in respect of the investigative and confidential committees. I trust that this meets the concerns of Deputies.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7)The Commission shall maintain a full record of its proceedings and those of each Committee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Following our discussion at committee, I have provided for amendments Nos. 38 and 39 to ensure that the commission maintains records of its work. I hope this will encompass the amendment proposed by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the record, people who are survivors of child abuse will be represented and cross-examined by the legal representatives of those accused. On the issue of legal representation of those who are survivors of child abuse, the Minister has made provision for a sum of £800 to be set aside for those who could not afford legal representation, but is he satisfied that throughout those lengthy hearings, a person who is a survivor of child abuse can be adequately represented legally on such an estimate? It seems the Minister is making wide provision for the legal costs of those accused but a very curtailed provision for those who are survivors of child abuse. It strikes me as being of concern and an imbalance. It is important that we strike a balance in all these matters.</P>
      <P>I tabled an amendment which the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order concerning ongoing legal representation for survivors as a class. On Report Stage we should hear the Minister's views on legal representation because it is crucial that those who are survivors of child abuse would have adequate legal representation. That is not to say we want the sort of legal representation that has caused a scandal in other tribunals, but we want adequate representation and that all sides would be treated fairly and equally in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have published the draft scheme &ndash; I said we would publish it before the Committee Stage was finished and I have done so. It is a draft scheme and is more or less along the normal provision for people who are the survivors in this case. Obviously there will be a difference between people who are accused and people who are survivors and making accusations, but the accused person may need more substantial representation. The draft scheme is there to be used. It is for the commission and it will advise on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point, what is the merit of including a figure when the term &ldquo;adequate representation&rdquo; would have done? The Minister says it is a matter for the commission and if one wants to avoid the suggestion that an open-ended purse is available to one side of the argument or to some people who may appear and that others are limited to an upper figure, why use the figure at all? Why not use a term such as &ldquo;adequate&ldquo;? As the Minister has said, the commission can exercise an opinion on what might be an abuse or some other formulation can be found. Why use <Col N="110" /> an upper figure? I have not heard the case for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reiterate what, as the Minister knows, I stated earlier. I do not want to be perceived as engaging in some sort of special pleading or vested interest because the law firm in which I am a partner acts for some of the people who are the survivors of abuse. There are many other survivors represented by other law firms. My firm does not have a monopoly in any way in this matter and whether my firm was involved or not, I would making the following points.</P>
      <P>I support the establishment of this commission and I want it to proceed with its work. Much preliminary work has been undertaken. I regard as quite extraordinary the scheme for the payment of legal expenses pursuant to section 20 of the Bill, as detailed in draft form by the Minister. It is extraordinary because I would expect that there are many people who are the survivors of abuse who find it extremely traumatic even today to set out the abuse they suffered. To formulate a submission to the commission, they will require legal help and a great deal of time will be spent by lawyers acting for them in putting together comprehensive and coherent submissions.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the question I raised previously with the Minister, I expect that they would be properly advised by lawyers. If they are to make a submission about their individual situation, it is very much in their interests and of great importance that they first have access to background documentation, specifically relating to them and to the records that exist. That will take a great deal of time and will have to be gone through and then they will appear before the commission and may well be represented.</P>
      <P>In that context I advise the Minister that there is no reality in the scheme he published. It creates the extraordinary anomaly that if I am the victim of abuse, I am entitled to £800 worth of legal help but if I am accused as a perpetrator of abuse and if I am an abuser, if I have sexually abused or beaten children, there is no limit on the expenditure I can incur, such as the services of senior counsel, maybe two senior counsels, junior counsel and solicitors and perhaps thousands and thousands of pounds of legal expense. Yet again the victims of abuse are being treated as second class citizens. They are being treated as people who are not as worthy of proper legal assistance and help as those who they may accuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude on this because I appreciate limited time is available on Report Stage. It may be that those who are accused will come before the commission and deny the accusations made. The commission may well have to make an adjudication in its report as to who is telling the truth. It may be that a victim or a survivor will want the opportunity to contradict what is said about him or her <Col N="111" /> by the person rebutting an accusation. They may need legal help for that. Will there be a situation where someone who alleges they were abused may be subject to cross-examination by senior counsels charging brief fees of £15,000 or £20,000 and £2,000 a day to sit on the commission for which the State will pay and that those who are victims of abuse and have survived abuse are to be left either bereft of legal assistance or to have a sort of &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; assistance whereby the only payment that are provided for lawyers allows them to briefly appear and then disappear? There is no reality in this scheme.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a need for this commission not to become unduly burdened by legal technicality and to allow it in a very practical and inquisitorial way to proceed with its work, which is the way I hope this commission will work. However, I see problems along the way if this scheme is not revised. I could see the problems being sufficiently great that if a scheme is not put in place that appropriately protects the legal rights of those who suffered abuse, that the schemes brought forward by the Minister may end up under court adjudication and be found to be unconstitutional as treating people unequally.</P>
    <P>It would be most regrettable if the work of this commission was delayed or hampered by court applications having been made because the Government has not properly thought through how the commission will work in practice and the need to protect the rights of those who were abused, while those against whom accusations are made have an opportunity to properly respond to those accusations.</P>

      <P>We should be clear that it is the commission which is carrying out this inquiry. The victims will be there as witnesses. We are examining the issue of continuing legal representation for victims, where they may want to get matters together and have information well prepared for a group that may be seeking representation. We are looking at the issue, but this amendment is not about any of those issues as far as I can see &ndash; we have strayed a long way from the amendment. The victims will have the support of counsellors and families. That is what was asked for. There will be a draft scheme in place for consultation with the commission itself once it is established. All I can say beyond that is that <Col N="112" /> we are examining the issue of continuing legal representation for victims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 13, after &ldquo;it&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including changes in the coverage of the Statute of Limitations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed the restrictions of the Statute of Limitations, but since that debate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform moved an amendment to the Statute of Limitations Bill which opened up the case of trailblazers, so to speak, who were being shut out by the Statute of Limitations. However, we still have the issue of those who suffered physical abuse as opposed to sexual abuse being denied recourse to the civil courts by the Statute of Limitations.</P>
      <P>Ms Justice Laffoy and her commission should be asked to make recommendations to the Oireachtas on this issue. The Minister will say this issue has been referred to the Law Reform Commission, but the Laffoy commission will have had first hand, intimate knowledge in relation to the running of institutions and the abuse that occurred in them. That commission would have recommendations that would be very important for the Oireachtas to consider if amending the Statute of Limitations for those who suffered physical abuse is considered. It seems indefensible for the Government to seek to draw distinctions between those who suffered sustained physical abuse and those who suffered sexual abuse. We should hear the commission's view on this issue at an early date for one of our interim reports, if that is how the commission feels it should be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the commission, as an independent statutory body, may make whatever recommendations it considers appropriate. It is not appropriate that the House should set out in advance, except in the broad terms now provided for, what the recommendations should deal with. However, I have undertaken to write to the commission to express to it the nature of the debate in the House on this Bill and I will include a reference to meet the wish expressed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute of Limitations Bill has been running in tandem with this one and has either completed or is about to complete its passage through the Seanad and return to the Dáil. As Deputy Bruton said, it creates the extraordinary anomaly whereby damages can be awarded to the survivors of sexual abuse but not to those <Col N="113" /> who have suffered physical abuse. In the context of Deputy Bruton's amendment, does the Minister know what progress the Law Reform Commission has made with this issue since it was referred to it in May 1999 by the Government? Does the Minister have a timeframe within which the Law Reform Commission report will be published? Did the Attorney General ask the Law Reform Commission to report on this matter within a particular timeframe? Will the Law Reform Commission publish a working paper before publishing a final report? Will it hold a consultative meeting, as it sometimes does? Will the report be received from the Law Reform Commission before the end of the year?</P>
      <P>I ask these questions because I am conscious that we envisage that the work of the Laffoy commission may take two years. It is a grave injustice that the Statute of Limitations Bill is to amend the law where one can seek compensation if one is the victim of sexual abuse but not of physical abuse. We will discover that for many people that distinction is inoperable when cases for damages are brought before the courts because on occasions sexual and physical abuse are so intermingled they cannot be dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Bill the Government seems intent on steamrolling through in its present form, with the removal of references to any form of abuse other than sexual abuse, will be amended as soon as possible. I am optimistic enough to hope that the Law Reform Commission will take the view that it is illogical to address one type of abuse in a particular way and not another. I ask that the Minister respond to these questions. Has the Government made a policy decision on whether, if the Law Reform Commission recommends that physical abuse should be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Statute of Limitations identical to that now being made regarding sexual abuse, it will implement that recommendation without undue delay or will the report be left gathering dust on the shelves of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Law Reform Commission expects to produce a consultation paper in the near future on the application of the Statute of Limitations in cases of physical abuse in childhood. The timeframe of the Law Reform Commission is a matter for the commission itself. In relation to the request Deputy Bruton made in connection with the amendment, I accept the request and will write to the commission.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 27, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;where it is satisfied that they were significantly culpable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the issue of findings by the commission. It will be able to reach findings in relation to the management, administration, operation, supervision and regulation of an institution and persons in whom they were vested and it may identify persons who were guilty of abuse.</P>
      <P>There is a need to qualify the circumstances in which persons will be named and there will have to be a significant degree of culpability in relation to those who are named. Some people were named in passing in other tribunals of inquiry of this type whose culpability was minimal, if it existed at all, but their being named caused them much difficulty. The power of naming will have to be used judiciously. I have proposed that naming will only occur where the commission is satisfied the persons so named were significantly culpable. I am interested in hearing the Minister's view. It is a case of trying to strike a balance and ensure this is handled fairly. Obviously, we must get to the root of any abuse. However, those involved in the running of institutions and who were not culpable should not be named unless the commission has a substantial reason to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

We should not have the random naming of people involved who were not culpable because in the public mind they will be associated with those who were. I take it the Minister is assuring me that those who were not culpable but who were involved in administration will not be named.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 31, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will make findings relating to the culpability of individuals guilty of abuse and the way institutions were managed but it will not make findings in particular instances of alleged child abuse. I am concerned that firm findings of <Col N="115" /> fact can be made that abuse occurred but victims and survivors of abuse who reported it will not be vindicated by the commission, who will be unable to say it found that abuse did occur in individual cases and victims' reports are substantially right.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this issue will be handled but it is difficult to understand how the commission will reach a finding of fact that a person was guilty of abuse but will not find that certain people were abused. This provision may make some people reluctant to present their cases before the commission if they feel they will not have the vindication of a finding that they were abused. This is a lingering concern.</P>
    <P>I know Ms Justice Laffoy chose this approach and is presenting it as the best balance, as opposed to a more detailed inquiry which would be necessary to make findings of fact. However, I am concerned that some people will prefer to take a civil action where a finding of fact can be made and the commission's work will be curtailed as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy answered his own question. The commission, having considered its terms of reference and the powers it would need, concluded in its report that the legislation should preclude the commission from making specific findings of fact in relation to specific allegations of abuse. The primary reason for the restriction is that many of the cases either are already or are likely to be the subject of civil litigation or criminal proceedings. For the commission to make findings in individual cases would, therefore, be to prejudge these proceedings. This would risk interfering with the judicial process and would be unconstitutional. Deputy Bruton is naturally concerned about people feeling they are vindicated. However, they will be vindicated in the findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case and the commission in making a finding of fact might interfere with the conclusions of a civil or criminal case and, therefore, stray past the boundaries of the constitutional remit of the courts, why not omit section 5(3)(<i>d</i>)? If the commission is possessed of such discretion and exercises it in the way described by the Minister why is paragraph (<i>d</i>) necessary? The advantage of this being omitted would be that the commission could then conclude what was proper and might even arrive at the conclusion suggested by the Minister. If it did, paragraph (<i>d</i>) is redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would find it extraordinary if Ms Justice Laffoy asked for an explicit proscription of findings of fact. That might be the view of the commission now, in advance of its hearings. However, when the hearings proceed, this might change and the commission could decide to attempt, without breaching the Constitution or interfering with the <Col N="116" /> integrity of civil or criminal proceedings, to make a statement. The commission could do this if paragraph (<i>d</i>) was omitted. However, with its inclusion, the commission is deciding in advance that in no circumstances should it attempt to take such a course of action. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) seems to be unusually restrictive. Everything mentioned by the Minister can be achieved without this paragraph, which would also allow for more flexibility.</P>

      <P>This amendment concerns the membership of the commission which was discussed on Committee Stage. Concerns have been expressed that members of the commission should have the confidence of both sides. It is important that everyone has confidence in the membership of the commission. Some concerns have been expressed that certain members do not have the confidence of all those who might present their case. It is important that the Government convinces those whom we want to present their cases to the commission that the membership it intends to select is the most appropriate, fair and balanced to hear them.</P>
      <P>My amendment states that the Government should bear in mind the need for members to have the confidence of those who suffered abuse and those who may be called to account for the running of institutions. This amendment, if accepted, would make it obligatory for the Government to seek to convince those who have concerns about any prospective members of the wisdom of the selection which the Government intends to make. It does not force the Government to make any decisions, but it does force the Government to bear in mind the need for confidence across the board. It is not an unreasonable amendment. It will give the Government the flexibility to consult and discuss the different names which it intends to put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage when I moved this amendment, there is no suggestion on my part that any of the prospective persons, which the Government may have in mind or whose names have been mentioned, are anything but of the highest character and no doubt suited to do the task. However, it is equally important that they have the confidence of everyone involved. Clearly a job of work must be done by the <Col N="118" /> Government to convince all those concerned that it is the right selection to do this job.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister may tell us that some progress has been made in this area because he signalled on Committee Stage that he is anxious that those whom he selects will have the confidence of all sides. I know he also has great confidence in those who he has shortlisted at this stage. I hope this is a helpful amendment which will encourage all those involved to come forward and present before the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has said everything that I needed to say except for one small point. My amendment No. 35 differs from amendment No. 34 only in so far as it seeks to exclude not just those who have been involved on or in assisting the management of an institution likely to be investigated by the commission or a similar institution wherever situate, but also those who might be likely to come before the commission. In other words, I am suggesting that an abused person who might be likely to come before the commission would be affected by my amendment, as would somebody who might be involved in the management.</P>
      <P>The thinking is that, whether one likes it or not, a person who is involved with the ethos or authority structure of the institution invariably carries some of that ambience and orientation with him or her. That was the worry on the one side. On the other, to have had an experience, such as those which the people likely to come before the commission have had, would give one a predisposing orientation towards those who had committed such actions. It was felt that the best way of handling this was to compose the commission of those who are an established distance from the matter. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>It is important to state that there is no suggestion that anyone in any way is impugning the good character, integrity and worth of those who have been mentioned. It is just that it is probably in everybody's best interest that these distances of which the amendments speak would be established and it probably would be conducive to maximum involvement in the work of the commission.</P>

      <P>It is inconceivable that the Government would appoint a person as a member of the commission who had a potential conflict of interest to the extent that an institution with which he or she was associated might be the subject of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Deputy Bruton's amendment, I would hope that the victims of abuse and others who come before the commission would have confidence in the professionalism and competence of the commission. However, confidence is a subjective matter for which we cannot legislate. We can <Col N="119" /> try to achieve it by ensuring that there are no conflicts of interest, but ultimately we can only rely on the professionalism of the commission and the application by it of fair procedures. I would be anxious to ensure that there were no conflicts of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, lest my amendment be misconstrued because we are all tired, I did not confine my amendment to any suggestion that the Government would appoint somebody who had worked or administered in or advised an institution under investigation. I extended it, as careful consideration of amendment will show, to state &ldquo;or a similar institution wherever situate&rdquo;. By that, as I stated in my introductory remarks proposing my amendment, I meant that there is a certain ethos in institutions and a certain concept of governance which comes from the authority structure from which it is difficult to distance oneself. In that sense, I was referring to a general institutional milieu from which a person might come.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in responding to my amendment, indicated that confidence is subjective. No doubt that is the case but it is also important, if this case is to succeed, that both sides involved would have confidence in the commission and the way the business will be run. I seek that the Government would bear in mind the need to make the maximum effort to secure that confidence. There have been issues raised which would suggest that some groups do not have confidence. In my view, there is a job of work to be done to convince them that their fears are misplaced.</P>
      <P>My amendment simply asks the Government to do what it should do anyhow. I feel my amendment is worthy because it underlines for the Government that this is what we want it to do, to set about convincing those who are going to present their case of the fairness of its selection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 5 to 20.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which we discussed on Committee Stage and it is an important amendment. The Select Committee on Education and Science, which considered the Bill on Committee Stage, received submissions from those representing institutions which provided care and those who represented survivors of abuse in such institutions. The committee considered that it was inappropriate and wrong that those who were staffing the commission should be employees of the Departments of Education and Science or Health and Children, which are under investigation by this commission for their roles in the management, administration, regulation and supervision of such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister contended on Second Stage that skilled members of staff in his Department had done much work in assembling material and assisting Ms Justice Laffoy, something I accept. I know there are very skilled and undoubtedly highly principled officials involved in this work, but it is important for the protection of the <Col N="121" /> Department and its staff that the staffing of the commission should be seen to be at arm's length from the Department. There should be no whiff or suggestion of a conflict of interest between those conducting the inquiries into these matters and their role as the employees of an institution which is under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>A well established principle is that conflicts of interest must be avoided even when they are not such that people would allow their judgment to be distorted. A long established practice is that Members of the Oireachtas cannot do certain things or be members of bodies because of the fear of a conflict of interest. The public has become increasingly conscious of this in recent times as a result of the tribunals of inquiry and the suggestions of conflicts of interest creating situations which are not in the best interest of ensuring public business is done in a fair and proper manner.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to provide that seconded staff from the Department will assist the commission in its work. It is not the way to proceed. We should second staff from any Department other than those under scrutiny. I do not suggest the commission must engage people on the open market, but from other Departments, such as the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, where there are professional and competent people capable of reading themselves into this brief and doing a good job on behalf of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not pass a provision which people will later say allows for an obvious conflict of interest. Before there is any suggestion of imbalance, we should delete these sections and allow only section 9(1) to stand, which states:</P>
    <P>The Commission may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, appoint such and so many persons as the commission may determine to be members of the staff of the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for me to repeat the arguments which have been made by Deputy Bruton. I went one step further in amendment No. 41 by suggesting that any Department being investigated should not supply staff to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I was powerfully influenced by the Minister's reply in two respects. There is a good case in terms of the expertise which has been established in looking at a complex issue to a certain point and that it would be a loss if this was not available to the commission. I was also impressed by the argument that one could establish distance between the structure of the Department under investigation and one's own position in it. I called a division on Committee Stage because I felt it was very important in terms of the public perception of the proceedings of the commission and in terms of protecting the <Col N="122" /> staff involved in such Departments as might come under investigation.</P>
    <P>Since Committee Stage I have been reading an interesting biography by Patrick Salmon of the Office of Public Works which could have been subtitled &ldquo;How my life was ruined by an insensitive Assistant Secretary and a jolly Secretary General who allowed him to have his way&rdquo;. People will have to wait for my review. The point is that whether we like it or not there is a structure in Departments, which was borne out in what was said in the House when the Minister's predecessor claimed to give an account of what happened at the time of the Kennedy investigation. I would say, <i>arbiter dictum</i>, that of course things have changed. We are always told they have changed for the better. However, they have not changed that radically.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Kennedy report an admirable civil servant was seconded to the committee and given the terrible burden of imprecision in relation to what he should do, of whether one was to keep a record of every event, etc. It is easy to be critical afterwards about what should have been kept. The instructions should have been explicit, but that was not the case. The correspondence which takes place and which is on the record of the House is interesting. It could be summarised as follows: &ldquo;one of my men is working with this committee and has told me some things which are alarming&rdquo;. There is no reference to the appalling consequences of what is happening to children, but there is a reference to what will happen if it becomes public. In this circumstance the Secretary of one Department writes to the Secretary of another about the propriety, as they see it, of keeping the lid on the issue.</P>
    <P>This is admittedly perhaps an archaic version of what happens in institutions imperfect in themselves, as we inherited them from the time of empire but now thoroughly reformed, and it begs the question as to why we should place the burden on a staff member, however talented and whose integrity we do not suspect for a second, of working on the commission while at the same time maintaining a distance from those to whom he or she will return. The easiest and best way in terms of public perception is to state that staff of Departments which will be robustly investigated should not supply staff to the commission. I have already acknowledged the downside of this, namely, that one loses an accumulated expertise and application. However, on balance in terms of what will be gained I am sticking to my amendment which is probably the most important I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Nobody shall be a judge in their own court&rdquo; is a well known legal phrase. The commission will inquire into matters which relate to the manner in which the Department of Edu<Col N="123" /> cation and Science managed the residential institutions for which it was responsible and the extent to which the Department of Health and Children did likewise. It is completely inappropriate, no matter how great the integrity of the individuals concerned &ndash; and I do not impugn any individual as having anything other than integrity &ndash; that officials who work in Departments which are under scrutiny by the commission should staff it. The idea of forming a commission to examine one's friends and colleagues with such a staffing arrangement is worthy of a Franz Kafka creation. It is inevitable that the commission will reach controversial conclusions on some issues.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest faith in the integrity of Ms Justice Laffoy and her independence. It is important that those people who feel that they have been wronged by the State or by State institutions have full confidence in the mechanism that is put in place to inquire into the horrible events over the years and the suffering inflicted on young children who found themselves in residential care.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies Bruton and Higgins. The two Departments referred to by them should not staff the commission. I would have no difficulty if it were staffed by any other Department, for example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, provided that the civil servants who are seconded never held office in the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is preferable that the commission's staff comes from a Department the <i>modus operandi</i> of which over the years will not be under scrutiny by the commission.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will realise the seriousness of this issue for those who survived abuse in our institutions. He must also realise that no matter what comfort he attempts to give by referring to the undoubted integrity of the individuals who will be seconded, those who suffered abuse feel that the State seriously and fundamentally let them down during their childhood. There is an understandable residue of suspicion and doubt in regard to the bona fides of the State in the context of the Government and its Departments examining and critically analysing the events that took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy has a huge job to do and she will be dependent on the substantial back-up that the civil servants seconded to her must provide. They should come from different Departments to those mentioned in the legislation. It is unfortunate that the degree of unease among those who are looking to the commission to relate the full story of what happened to them during their childhood is not understood by the Government or appreciated by the Minister. It is difficult for those of us who are fortunate enough not to have <Col N="124" /> suffered such abuse to understand the degree of genuine suspicion as a consequence of the hurt that was suffered.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that the Minister will agree to the deletion of these sections. However, I ask him to examine the secondment of staff from other appropriate Government Departments or other areas of the public service rather than from the two Departments which will be under the greatest scrutiny before the Bill is taken in the Seanad. I also rule out seconding civil servants from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which also had a remit to ensure that children put into care by the courts were properly protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. I appreciate how strongly the Deputies feel but, as I made clear on Committee Stage, the amendments should not be made. They have clear implications for the timescale within which the commission can begin its operations and its effectiveness and efficiency once it does so. The Deputies' concern relates to possible conflicts of interest because seconded staff belong to Departments which are under investigation. Such conflicts of interest do not arise. The staff concerned are professional administrators with no role in making any evaluations of evidence or reaching any conclusions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter suggested that no one should be a judge in their own court. Ms Justice Laffoy will preside over the commission and she is eminently happy with the staff who have been seconded. They have done an excellent job to date. Civil servants work in general Civil Service grades and transfer between Departments from time to time. Consequently, there would have to be a witch hunt across Departments. In addition, decentralisation has resulted in major changes in Departments with people transferring here and there. An inquiry would be needed and it is not necessary or relevant in the context of the commission. I stand over the civil servants who are doing excellent work for the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission or its legal representative will conduct the examination of witnesses. The commission will weigh up the evidence, reach conclusions and draft its report. It is inconceivable that its members would allow themselves to be influenced in such matters by administrative staff. On the other hand, if the amendment denies the possibility of staff from any Government Department or public body working with the commission, it would be obliged to commence an extensive process searching for other suitably qualified staff and interviewing and selecting such <Col N="125" /> staff. It is difficult to see how this could be done within any reasonable timescale.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the potential for conflicts of interest is very remote and, in so far as it might exist, I am further satisfied that the commission will be in a position to prevent it. The damage done to it by these amendments would far outweigh any benefit which could be gained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is misleading the House regarding the role of the staff of the commission. Under section 21 the staff will act as inquiry officers to perform functions of inquiry. They will conduct interviews with persons making allegations of abuse and take statements from them. They will be intimately involved in the evaluation of the evidence that is presented. They are not part of a typing pool, which will just type up what the commission might find in particular cases. These people will be intimately involved in the entire process and to represent their role as purely administrative is misleading. The Minister is completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> There is no suggestion in either amendment that he must go outside the Civil Service to establish panels of interviewees. I would be quite happy with the appointment of public servants from Departments other than those under investigation to carry out the sensitive work of the commission. I do not accept the Minister's view. If the commencement date is delayed by a little while, it will not be regarded as the end of the world by the survivors or those who might be accused. It would be better if this were done properly in order that any potential conflicts of interest are avoided, even if it requires a month to be devoted to appointing other persons to act as inquiry officers and carry out other important support work for the commission. I cannot understand the Minister's obstinacy on this issue.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Development Aid: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Tuesday, 11 April 2000:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann notes, with great concern that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;14 million young children and 10 million older children, and young adults, in developing countries die each year from easily and cheaply preventable malnutrition and disease;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;840 million people in developing countries are malnourished;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;women represent 70 per cent of all poverty stricken people, followed closely by the elderly in developing countries;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;approximately 79 per cent of the world's population now live in the Third World;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;more than 90 per cent of the 35 million HIV/AIDS infected people live in developing countries, the number having doubled between the years 1990 and 1997;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;life expectancy in the Third World increased by over one third between the years 1960 and 1990, and the infant mortality rate decreased from 76 to 58 per 1000 live births, proving that development aid does work, even though about 1.5 billion people are not expected to survive to 60 years of age, and 340 million women will die before the age of 40;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">noting the pending disaster in the Horn of Africa, where up to 16 million lives are in imminent danger, asks the Government to bring forward immediate legislation to provide for Ireland to meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as a contribution to development aid by 2007, without recourse to the annual Estimates wrangle, thereby ensuring that Ireland maximise its contribution to our famine stricken and poorest neighbours, while equipping ourselves with moral authority in asking other countries to do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I opened my remarks on this motion, which I welcomed, and in favour of the amendment, which I prefer, by saying that globalisation represents a serious new circumstance in which the old considerations of aid, trade and debt must be re-evaluated in terms of poorer countries, particularly those on the continent of Africa. I am concerned that this aspect of globalisation and its impact on debtor countries and those classified as undeveloped is not adequately appreciated.</P>
      <P>At a conference organised by Trócaire, which was held in Dublin two years ago, a number of speakers including Peter Sutherland &ndash; who represented a certain viewpoint &ndash; commented on globalisation while a number of people from Africa commented on what it involved. Last night I stated that there is more communication capacity in Manhattan than there is in sub-Saharan Africa. That illustrates an important point, namely, the suggestion that within a model of globalisation driven by mere liberal market thinking there can be benefits that will lift Africa and its people is erroneous.</P>
      <P>If one examines the logic of a situation where societies have become economies which have, in  turn, shrunk to become market flows, it is apparent that globalisation is driven to a great degree by suggested possibilities of a communications revolution. The reality is, however, that the communications revolution component of globalisation is designed to massively benefit western society. Evidence is becoming available in relation to economic participation that the fissures which are opening up, even in western countries, between the information rich and the information poor, threaten to divide society even more deeply than the factory system did in the past. That has led many people at international conferences to speak about the need for an ethic that is global to accompany and correct a version of markets that is also global.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not just an academic point because on a yearly basis the countries in Africa, some of which are among the poorest nations in the world that are seeking to qualify for debt relief or trying to construct strategies of survival &ndash; these cannot, in many cases, be referred to as &ldquo;development strategies&rdquo;&ndash; are being asked to make adjustments. These adjustments are inappropriate in relation to the structures that would give them security of life, being and development. The evidence is overwhelming of where, in the name of debt management, adjustments were forced on countries which led to health and education budgets being cut. I could provide examples of coun<Col N="130" /> tries where the net debt repayment outflow after adjustment was still greater than what was being spent on health, education and housing.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency among the richer members of society to blame undeveloped countries for the position in which they find themselves. Those countries have been left with an immense burden of colonisation which trampled many indigenous forms of civil society in the name of introducing a metropolitan language and a legal system that replaced the native system in Africa. To speak as if they were to blame for their situation is a despicable excuse.</P>
    <P>We come back to the fundamental issues. What can be wrung from the World Trade Organisation in terms of real concessions? What can be done about non-tied aid? What can be done about the structuring of debt? There is another aspect to this matter and I am free to point it out in this Parliament. I know of no time since I started in politics nearly 30 years ago when there was a bigger gulf between economics and ethics. I cannot remember a time when there was such little attachment between economics and political economy.</P>
    <P>When I learned about the political economy and lectured on it for a number of years the prevailing notion was that the economy was an instrument for the achievement and service of social and political ends upon which people could differ and debate. Now we appear to be in the grip of a disembodied economy that has its own characteristics. It is as if it were a machine, separate from any human reality. Every now and again church leaders will draw attention to our humanity and ask us to consider the number of people who are dying.</P>
    <P>There are parts of Africa where one can detect some growth in gross domestic product. However, where these occur they are precariously fragile and the benefits are unevenly distributed. Again one hears the suggestion, which I consider deeply offensive, that if these countries were like ours, things would be much better. However, in the quintiles into which one might divide the populations of the United States, Japan, Ireland and England, the poorest quintile in each country has got poorer and the top fifth has got a greater proportion of the wealth. We are in no position to give anybody lectures about redistribution.</P>
    <P>We are, however, in a position to acknowledge that the relationship of the western world with Africa in relation to arms production and arms sales is outrageous. The fact that countries which signed up to international agreements which purported to make claims in the name of humanity would sell armaments, such as Britain, France and the others do, into the continent of Africa at a time of such urgent need is appalling. There is, therefore, a debt owed or a moral deficit on the part of the west in relation to these countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> It is time parliamentarians woke up and realised that they can do nothing substantial while we reduce society to a version of the economy that is a neo-liberal market driven by telecommunications finance. The international economy could be best described as resembling the time of the establishment of the sugar plantations in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when the magnet of sugar set up a system of economics built on slavery and indentured servants. The same thing happens in relation to the scarce resource that is the telecommunications capacity.</P>
    <P>According to the UNDP report to which I referred last night, 33 of the least developed countries are in Africa. Zambia had slipped from 136th place out of 174 to 142nd in 1997 and 146th in 1998. These countries are slipping further each year. The external debt of sub-Saharan Africa in 1998 stood at US$235 billion. More money was going out of Africa than was available to meet any definition of basic needs, including health, education, food, water and sanitation.</P>
    <P>In the 30 years since I first stood for election, I have seen the emergence of increased public interest and aid. However, I have also seen a decrease in aid accompanying the new idea of the depeopled economy. The aid that is delivered to countries which need it most has decreased. We should cancel debt and speak of adjustments that meet the needs of people and are indigenously acceptable rather than structural adjustment programmes to suit a neo-liberal market. We should discuss a trade system in which we allow privileged access for countries which produce primary products.</P>
    <P>With regard to debt servicing, the view represented by Ireland at international fora should be that no country should have to expend more than a certain proportion of its total GDP on the service of debt to any international institution. Otherwise our response will be too little too late. Above all, we should earmark our response to crisis by stating that any aid voted will be for emergencies and will not be deflected from the structural aid programme on which we have such a good record.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of addressing this important issue. I wish to express my appreciation for the substantial contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to development co-operation and human rights over the years. I also commend the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, ably led by Ms Margaret <Col N="132" /> Hennessy who continues to show excellent leadership in sometimes difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia ceases. The obscene arms industry, so ably described by Deputy Higgins, has much to answer for with regard to that ongoing war. It is unacceptable that because of the war the tragic people of both countries, particularly northern Eritrea, should starve. I strongly support the views outlined in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 6 April by David Beggs, the chief executive of Concern. He pointed out that the Ethiopian Prime Minister made a scathing attack on the international community for its failure to respond to appeals for food aid to stave off famine in his country. Mr. Beggs went on to develop the second point that western Governments have in turn blamed Ethiopia for pursuing a pointless war with its northern neighbour Eritrea at a time when the country is in such dire straits. He pointed out that both arguments are irrelevant when eight million people are starving to death in Ethiopia and that the number at risk can be doubled when six other countries in the Horn of Africa are taken into account.</P>
      <P>Mr. Beggs set out a number of urgent actions that should be taken. The international community must immediately provide the one million tonnes of food needed and get it onto the high seas. There must be an immediate armistice to allow humanitarian aid to flow into Ethiopia through the Eritrean ports. If necessary, an airlift should be considered to bridge the gap until food can arrive by sea. Every effort must be made to source food from northern Sudan and those parts of Ethiopia where there may be a surplus. The United Nations agencies and NGOs must be given freedom to operate, albeit in consultation with the Ethiopian Government, and be allowed to take in whatever human and material resources they need. Extensive use should be made of NGO capacity for distribution to guarantee that aid is not diverted for military use.</P>
      <P>NGOs must receive the unstinting support of this House. These organisations do immeasurable work in often difficult and dangerous circumstances. The Minister of State has said elsewhere that this area of policy, especially the question of financial provision for official development assistance, should be above partisan politics.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus view across the political spectrum that Ireland's development co-operation role should be strengthened. Our debate, and our differences to the extent that they exist, are about means, not ends. What is important is that our principles on the question should be matched by our practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our practice has two aspects: quantity and quality. The quantity of Ireland's development assistance has grown significantly in absolute terms, from £40 million in 1992 to approximately £190 million in the current year. As Minister for <Col N="133" /> Foreign Affairs at that time I had a small input to giving that aspect a kick start. However, when measured as a proportion of GNP we have failed to make progress in recent years. Considering that the ODA-GNP ratio is a conventional way of measuring a country's aid effort and considering especially that this is for the very good reason that it is the best measure of a country's capacity to contribute development aid, there is a need to take definite steps to get us back on to a pattern of growth. What is needed, in effect, are financial allocations large enough to guarantee growth in GNP terms, even in circumstances of a rapidly growing GNP.</P>
    <P>The allocations need to be made far enough in advance to allow expenditure plans to be drawn up in a satisfactory way. The mechanisms through which this is achieved are not so important. It is not good enough to rely on the annual Estimates process on the one hand, as this does not provide certainty on the allocations for future years as it runs the risk that in the heat of the fray there would be slippage in the priority accorded to ODA as compared with competing demands. On the other hand, legislation may not be the best way to proceed because it may be too cumbersome and time consuming. It may also not be necessary to achieve the outcome we desire.</P>
    <P>From my perspective, a formal Cabinet decision confirming annual substantial increases for, say, a ten year period would be the most practical and effective way to proceed. The increased allocations would have to be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our development co-ordination policy and programme. It would be very important that Members of this House have the opportunity to make an effective contribution to the articulation of that strategy.</P>
    <P>So much for the question of aid quantity. The question of aid quality is even more important. I am heartened by the very positive comments made about our programme in last year's OECD peer review. The two questions are linked, as reliable monthly funding is the essential foundation on which a quality programme may be built.</P>
    <P>Concerning quality, the key question is to keep a firm hold of the idea that the purpose of aid is to assist developing countries. This may appear to be an obvious point, but we can become so tied up in the provision of assistance that we can lose sight of how things can look from the other side of the aid relationship. A useful discipline in that context is to consider how we in Ireland dealt with the receipt of EU Structural Funding. We should keep a firm hold on the idea that funds received were to promote sustainable development in Ireland. We were clear that external assistance had to be integrated with our own developments and that it was our priorities that mattered in terms of the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> A key principle of our development co-operation policy should be that developing countries have a comparable role in relation to their own development and to aid received from other countries. In that context I would like to hear from the Minister of State in her concluding remarks about how support for capacity building is incorporated in the Ireland Aid programme. If Ireland Aid can bring in the resources required, for example, for an immunisation campaign in the developing countries, that would be a commendable thing to do. It would be even more useful to help build up the capacity of the country concerned to plan, finance and execute immunisation campaigns on a self-reliant basis. The second of these approaches is significantly more difficult than the first. I hope and trust that Ireland Aid adopts the capacity building approach in preference to using aid resources to address merely the symptoms of underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>This is my first opportunity to express my praise and appreciation for my successor in office, Deputy Cowen. He made a very important start to his new portfolio and I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It often appears that there are two groups of people on the planet, both going in opposite directions. In the developed world we are moving towards the future at a speed faster than our dreams. The other group, in the Third World, is hurtling into a nightmare of darkness, hunger and disease. In the developed world we have a human imperative to help those in the Third World. We must avoid the well meaning but futile gesture and do things that genuinely help, not things that help us in the developed world feel less bad.</P>
      <P>Irish assistance to the Third World has always been of the highest quality. There are students in African universities today who would not be able to read if it had not been for Irish aid. People would be blind but for medical assistance from this country. We must not forget that there are thousands of people who would not be alive today were it not for Irish development aid. These people are living testimonies to the effectiveness of our assistance and its high standards.</P>
      <P>Direct aid is only one strand of our response. It goes hand in hand with the work of non-governmental organisations. We have a long and distinguished record going back over 100 years. Many people, both lay and religious, have devoted their lives to helping the Third World. A smaller number have given their lives. Most could have enjoyed a far more comfortable lifestyle if they had not left Ireland. They were our modern missionaries, whether or not their work was involved with religion. What motivated them was not a wish to colonise or enslave but a burning desire to help their fellow human beings, to free them from poverty and hunger and to share knowledge and know-how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> Our systems, both governmental and through NGOs, has been aided by our history. First, we were the last country in western Europe to experience a full blown famine. It is a long way from our current affluence, but it happened only four generations ago. There are commentators and journalists, thankfully not in Ireland, who say that Third World poverty and famine relief is useless and that no matter what the developed world does or how much it spends, famines will still occur. They consider that development aid can not overcome problems built in the Third World societies. Some people said the same thing about Ireland in the 1840s. It did not take us long as a people to demonstrate that once our dignity was given back to us there were no limits to the goals we could achieve.</P>
    <P>Second, we were not part of the small club of nations who saw the Third World as a place to fulfil their imperial dreams. Thankfully we had no colonial history or ambitions. Both these historical factors have allowed Irish men and women, whether lay or religious, working for Government aid projects or for NGOs, to have an understanding and sympathy for the people they are trying to help. They have not believed themselves to be inherently better than those in the Third World. Their assistance has always been motivated by a wish to give real, practical help to fellow human beings, assistance which will help people to help themselves. We have not asked for anything in return. This is why the people of the Third World have always seen Ireland as a good friend. We have always been viewed as partners giving a helping hand, not as masters imposing solutions.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We have a duty to ensure that the quality of our assistance is maintained and that the real proof of this quality in the alleviation of poverty and the realisation of a better lifestyle continues. One aspect that no report can ever represent adequately is the scale of commitment of the individuals involved in development aid work. This is one of the factors which has given our assistance such a high reputation. It is a commitment which cannot be valued in purely financial terms.</P>
    <P>Assistance takes two forms. On the one hand, there is help within the context of a long-term strategy, whether it is improving access to clean water, preventing soil erosion, improving infrastructure or combating disease. The second type is called for by unprecedented, unforeseen situations, such as famines and natural disasters. There is an overspill between the two areas. While disasters cannot always be foretold with accuracy, their potential impact can be lessened. We have been very successful in putting in place early warning systems. These can only work when disasters can be forecast. Other disasters are caused by factors which strike with much less warning. For example, the floods in Mozambique were <Col N="136" /> caused by a weather phenomenon. Its effects were heightened by difficulties that only long-term planning can alleviate, the type of long-term, painstaking assistance the Irish Government has deliberately targeted at Mozambique. This has been implemented in partnership with the authorities in Mozambique.</P>
    <P>Many working in development assistance criticise what they call the &ldquo;CNN syndrome&rdquo; towards the Third World. Whenever a disaster occurs, it is flashed across our television screens. After a few weeks, maybe less, the cameras go elsewhere. People think that the removal of the attention of the cameras implies that the initial problem has lessened in some way when it may be as bad as ever. Our development assistance programmes are continuing in Mozambique because we have a long-term commitment to the country and its people.</P>
    <P>Most of us remember the scenes of horror that inspired the Live Aid concert in 1985. In those days, the Third World was a Cold War battleground. Governments viewed as friendly to one player were undermined by rebellions sponsored by the other. The ordinary people of Ethiopia and Mozambique were among the victims and losers in this conflict. Vast quantities of armaments and guns were delivered. Land mines were planted which continued to maim and kill long after the wars ended. It is ironic that a few hundred pounds in development aid can give a community clean water, water ponds, dams, seeds, implements for cultivating crops and maybe even a school. In other words, they provide a chance for a better future. A lesser amount can buy a shell that can destroy that village in an instant, turning those who it does not kill or cripple into starving refugees.</P>
    <P>Wars and conflict are all too common in the Third World, but they can be avoided. That is why there must always be a political dimension to our development aid strategy. One area where this is already implemented successfully is in support for human rights initiatives and assistance in the establishment of conflict resolution mechanisms.</P>
    <P>There is only so much a small country like ours can achieve on its own. We as a country have done a great deal to help the Third World, but we want to do more and we want other countries to pull their weight too. Why is it that there are those, in this country and Europe, who worry about a common European defence policy, yet those same people never see the need for a common European strategy to help Third World poverty? The European Union has been consistently slow in responding to these problems. It should play a much greater role in conflict resolution for it is as a group that the European Union can make its voice heard. Its response is often piecemeal. Some countries, such as France and Portu<Col N="137" /> gal, take an interest in various nations because of colonial ties while ignoring others.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that Ireland's development aid programme continues according to its very high standards which value people above everything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion covers many different problem areas throughout the Third World. While I will not have time to deal with all of them, the request for the Government to bring forward immediate legislation to provide for Ireland to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP as a contribution to development aid is one we must support. I know many Members have taken a great interest in the Third World, not just by their words but also by their deeds and actions. It is not long ago that Deputy Owen visited that part of the world and returned to tell us of the problems she witnessed at first hand. Never before have we been in a better position to make this move and never before was that move needed so much. The Minister explained the Government's position but I appeal to him to bring forward the legislation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As we debate the problems in the Horn of Africa, millions of people are hungry. Thousands have already died due to lack of food and these are lives which should never have been lost. Unfortunately, the international community does not place the same price on a life in the Horn of Africa as it does in an oil-producing country or where other valuable resources are located. The international community has failed the people of Ethiopia. The problems faced in that country must be tackled by both short-term and long-term measures. As a country, we have always shown great compassion in dealing with and helping developing countries. Providing health and education is vital if these people are to have any future. Immediate help is now required if we want to save the millions of lives in danger. Food is what they require. It is vital that Ireland provides this aid and it is even more important that Ireland shows leadership to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained during his contribution how he had pressed for early and appropriate action by the EU and he stressed the urgency of an immediate response in bilateral conversations with Commissioner Patten. It appears from media reports that Commissioner Patten is satisfied with the EU response. However, Fr. Jack Finucane, who is in Ethiopia dealing with the problem on a daily basis, does not share the same view. John O'Shea has also said that it is a race against time and that it is imperative the international community and the Ethiopian Government focus all their energies on alleviating the suffering. That is a view all Irish people share. I pay tribute to GOAL and Concern for the wonderful work they have done. It is only when we see the pictures on our tele<Col N="138" /> visions that we realise the tragedies with which these organisations must deal on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>If the tragedy being experienced in the Horn of Africa were to be experienced in the USA or Europe, there would be an immediate reaction from the rest of the world. However, just because the countries affected now do not have the same resources or are not in a position to give the payback as other countries have done in the past does not mean they should be ignored. We must put the same value on a life in Africa as in Ireland or any other country. It is on that basis we must plan. I wish both GOAL and Concern every success with their efforts.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion. I noticed in the new <i>Irish Examiner</i> a reference to a high-powered delegation, led by the World Food Programme director, Ms Catherine Bertini, which landed at Gode airstrip to assess the crisis. Aid agencies and officials were planning to meet her to brief her on the worsening conditions. The reporter stated: &ldquo;For countless children practising high-fives in a land laid waste by war and hunger, the effort may come just a little too late.&rdquo;  It is serious if it is the case that rich countries do not have the conscience to act quickly to save lives and that a delegation such as this has arrived in Ethiopia late in the day. In the same newspaper, John O'Shea referred to the fact that sick people are dying on a daily basis in Ethiopia due to the shortage of food and water and that the situation is far worse in towns where no aid is provided. He states:</P>
      <P>Even the camels are beginning to die and camels can survive in almost any conditions. The area here is an animal graveyard and unless people act fast, it will become a human graveyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those comments illustrate the seriousness of the situation in Ethiopia. I was pleased to hear the Minister stating that a comprehensive package of initiatives is being put in train to strengthen our development co-operation policy and programme. In the past, there was a feeling that a token contribution to development aid work would be sufficient. In the early 1980s, Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income was closer to that of developing countries than to the average for northern European countries. That is no longer the case. Today, Ireland has one of the fastest growing economies in the western world and our responsibilities have increased in line with this. The allocation for development aid has increased from £40 million in 1992 to an estimated £190 million this year, a substantial increase by any standards. As GNP has increased so rapidly in recent years, the size of the ODA budget has not increased relative to that. This is unfortunate but does not detract from the impressive annual increases which have been made since the Government took office. <Col N="139" /> There would be strong public and cross-party support in this House for measures which would ensure that our ODA allocation would increase not only in financial terms but as a proportion of GNP.</P>
    <P>There is a perception among the public that the money has been used to good effect, something to which I can testify. I travelled to Africa on a number of occasions. I recall the then consul general, Mr. Pat Curran, overseeing self-help programmes such as knitting projects and pony trekking in Lesotho. I observed the work carried out by the NGOs in Lesotho and by the area partnership programmes in Tanzania. The development of aid programmes in these countries has been very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The quality of our aid programme was endorsed by last year's peer review which was carried out by the development assistance committee of the OECD. If the programme continues to be effective, the level of public support will remain high. We must also invest in education and health programmes. The Minister acknowledged the progress which has been made to date in terms of increasing the aid allocation, not only in absolute terms but as a proportion of GNP. We should take all necessary steps to ensure the effective implementation of the programme. The success of our economy as a result of investment in education shows what can be done in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that a new development co-operation strategy will be unveiled in the near future which will address the quantity and quality of our aid programmes. The new strategy will be awaited with interest as there is a real sense that it is now time to put our development co-operation policy on a solid footing once and for all.</P>
    <P>Another great tragedy is currently unfolding in the Horn of Africa. We must do our utmost to help to alleviate the suffering of up to eight million people. A call was made for the cancellation of debt in Mozambique but payment of the debt was merely suspended. That is certainly not an adequate response. While emergency assistance is required, we must also consider the need for long-term sustainable development which will address the eradication of poverty. This is the key to the prevention of further tragedies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of funding for priority countries. One third of the budget is going to these countries with some £6 million going to Lesotho, £7.3 million to Mozambique and £16. 3 million to Ethiopia. I urge the Minister and the Cabinet to make a commitment to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by a specific date.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell. In moving the motion, Deputy Mitchell is reflecting the concerns felt by Irish people about these terrible tragedies in developing countries, people such as the members of Jubilee 2000 &ndash; comprising school children and others who worked overseas in a voluntary capacity &ndash; who campaign for debt relief and who protested outside Leinster House yesterday. We should support their campaign.</P>
      <P>Legislation must be introduced to ensure we give the appropriate amount of aid to needy countries, particularly in view of our own prosperity. It is extraordinary that the target of 0.7% of GNP was set by the United Nations in 1970 and that it has taken us such a long time to move towards even considering the introduction of legislation in this area. Legislation moves things forward, provides leadership, represents our feelings about particular issues and turns those into realities. I was disappointed to hear the former Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that he felt a Cabinet decision was sufficient. I do not believe it is. We should have legislation setting matters out in black and white. The target proposed in the motion should be agreed on.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there is political consensus about the need to move forward on this issue and that, given our current levels of prosperity, we are in a position to make a meaningful contribution to tackling poverty worldwide. If we do not tackle poverty, mass movements of people will create huge instability throughout the world. We should ensure that aid is delivered to people in their home areas, not when they have left them.</P>
      <P>The statistics quoted last night are very frightening. Some 14 million young people and 10 million older children and young adults are dying each year in developing countries from preventable malnutrition and disease. There are 840 malnourished people in developing countries. Women represent 70% of all poverty-stricken people, followed closely by the elderly. Evidence is emerging, slowly but surely, that development aid works. Deputy Mitchell referred to that last night. We know aid can work if it is of the proper quality, provided in proper quantities and administered and monitored by the right people who will work with local people. Some of the aid provided in the past did not work and tended to disenfranchise rather than empower people. However, we have learned from our mistakes and now have better information about the type and quality of aid required and the necessity to work with local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening, Fr. Jack Finucane stated that we now have a golden opportunity to prevent the occurrence of a major catastrophe. He said that some eight million people are at risk in Ethiopia <Col N="141" /> and that donor countries must act more effectively. It was disappointing to hear Chris Patten defending the EU because it should not be defended. I urge the Government to do whatever it can at European level to press for further and more efficient action from the EU. The statistics in regard to the amount of aid returned to the EU are quite extraordinary. Ireland should lead the fight to find out why this money is not being delivered efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>The early warning system is clearly working more effectively in Ethiopia now than it did in 1974 and 1984. However, it is clear that the EU's emergency response is not working. A previous Deputy spoke about our focus on the EU rapid reaction force at defence level. We also need rapid responses to humanitarian aid at EU level. The Government should move towards multi-annual funding for development agencies as that would enable them to do their work more effectively. I hope the House will support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my disappointment at the fact that the Government feels it is necessary to divide the House on a motion tabled in all sincerity on behalf of the Fine Gael Party by our spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell. It is pitiable that the Government could not see its way to accepting the motion and felt it was necessary to divide the House on a matter as serious as providing assistance to billions of people throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The announcement by the IMF and the World Bank to suspend payment of Mozambique's debt for one year is not a sufficient response to the catastrophe which occurred in that country. Mozambique needs another 15 years to re-establish itself. This debt should be unconditionally waived. I want the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to take a personal, strong stand on this at European Union level and to lead the way in having Mozambique's debt written off completely.</P>
      <P>I ask Members to picture every man, woman and child on this island being in need of food aid. That was the equivalent situation in 1999 in Ethiopia. The NGOs and the other agencies were already warning in 1999 that a catastrophe was coming because there was no rain in 1998. Food supplements were being given in Ethiopia in 1999. Why are we finding now in 2000 that double the number of people living on this island are threatened by famine in Ethiopia, plus four or five million in Somalia and northern Kenya? It beggars belief that it is only now that the penny is dropping. A UN country request was made last year for food, and countries gave commitments to send food to Ethiopia which they did not meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984 and 1985, post the horrific famine in which 1.2 million people lost their lives, food reserves were set up. The aim was to keep that food reserve at 350,000 metric tonnes of food in <Col N="142" /> store. The world food programme borrowed food from that reserve last year and in previous years, which it has not paid back. Hence, the reserve is down to about 30,000 or 40,000 metric tonnes, which is not enough. That is why we are facing such a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>The international community has not lived up to its commitments. Through this debate tonight, we, as country, must live up to our commitments and call on our partners in Europe to take action. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has a seat at that table and she must do that on behalf of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most harrowing experiences of life was going to Ethiopia during the great famine in the mid-1980s. It is equally harrowing to see on television what I saw on the ground at that time developing again. It is even more harrowing to find us in a situation where, while we now have the wealth and resources to make an effective contribution towards preventing that impending catastrophe, we are not doing all we could. The bottom line is that, while this country now has wealth and resources, it is not fulfilling its UN obligations. We can twist this any way we like, but the fact is we committed ourselves to the target of 0.7% of GNP. Why are we not even half way towards reaching that target at the moment?</P>
      <P>We receive all the Civil Service answers in ministerial scripts. In the old days the usual formula was &ldquo;we will achieve the target when resources permit&rdquo;. The new formula is that &ldquo;we will do it within a specific timeframe&rdquo;. That is just an updating of the escape hatch. Why are we not even half way towards the target?</P>
      <P>I have a couple of specific suggestions to make. I was able to achieve something worthwhile as a consequence of my visit to Ethiopia in the mid-1980s. It helped that we had the Presidency of the European Union, which was then the European Community, at the time, which meant I was able to mobilise EU support. It would be worthwhile if the Minister or Minister of State were prepared to go to Addis Ababa to show on the ground our commitment to trying to prevent this gathering catastrophe. I would recommend that very strongly.</P>
      <P>This House should have a united voice on our future aid policy. Let us forget these escape hatch clauses of &ldquo;as resources permit&rdquo; and &ldquo;within a specific timeframe&rdquo;. Let us agree on a timeframe, as suggested in the Fine Gael motion. If we are serious, let us agree it and if we are not serious, let us face up to that, say so and tell the country why the Government is not prepared to do what the people want, as they have shown in the past by their generous response to appeals when disasters struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger of a cosy consensus about what a great job we are doing. The aid pro<Col N="143" /> gramme has developed and those involved in it have done a marvellous job. The voluntary organisations, missionaries and NGOs have done a tremendous job on behalf of Ireland. I want a greater proportion of aid to go through the voluntary sector, so that GOAL, Concern and Trócaire will have adequate funding. However, let there be no cosy consensus in this House if we are not prepared to do our bit in terms of the UN target, which we are less than half way towards reaching at the moment. When I left office, we were at 0.26% of GNP and we are not much further now. Let us end this charade and agree to achieve the UN target within the timeframe set out in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell on tabling this motion. I have also seen poverty in Africa and other countries, such as India. There is an obligation on each Western state to ensure this is tackled comprehensively. I want to set out some facts regarding the difference between the West and the Third World.</P>
      <P>A woman in Ireland has a life expectancy of about 80 years while a woman in Sierra Leone can expect to live to 37 years. Every year 600,000 women die in pregnancy and childbirth, most of them in the Third World. A further 20 million women suffer life long injuries or infections each year during childbirth, most of whom, for obvious reasons, are in the Third World. Some 360 million couples want to plan their families but do not have access to contraceptive advice and services, and most of them are in the Third World. Some 70,000 women die from unsafe abortions each year, most of whom are in the Third World. Nine out of ten people in Africa with HIV do not know they are infected.</P>
      <P>Change can take place rapidly. In Thailand so many people availed of family planning following a public education campaign that the country's birth rate was halved in eight years. Every year more than 1.4 million infants are stillborn. A baby born in Malaya or Uganda is likely to live only half as long as one born in Singapore or Sweden, and reaching his or her fifth birthday is far from a certainty. One child in three born in Sierra Leone perishes before that milestone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, worldwide, 130 million children of primary school age, two thirds of whom are girls, who are not in a classroom. In developing countries, every additional year of schooling for girls can be linked to a 5% decline in infant morality. Some 4.4 million adolescent girls seek abortions every year. In Kenya alone, 10,000 girls drop out of school each year as a result. Children born to mothers below 15 years are 1.5 times more likely to die before the age of five than those with mothers aged 20 to 34 years. Two million girls each year are subject to female genital mutilation, <Col N="144" /> most of them in the Third World. Of the 14 million people worldwide who have died from AIDS, more than one quarter have been children. Last year alone, two million men, women and children in Africa died from the disease.</P>
    <P>The wealthiest fifth of the world's population consumes more than 66 times the materials and resources of the poorest fifth. Of the $17 billion promised in overseas aid, many wealthy Governments have not produced the cash for use in the Third World. The bank balance is less than half what it should be to assist such aid schemes. UNICEF has calculated that it would cost $2.60 per person world-wide to effectively prevent the overwhelming majority of maternal deaths, half of all infant deaths and the disabilities inflicted on millions of women.</P>
    <P>The world's population took thousands of years to reach 2.5 billion by 1950, but since then it has more than doubled to 6 billion. Every second, five people are born while two die, which is a net gain of three people. If women have 2.5 children on average, the world's population may reach 27 billion by 2050. The rising population figure has deep implications for the Third World. The western world has a duty to ensure it assists Third World development in every way possible and for that reason I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell in bringing this timely motion before the House. It is difficult to understand the lack of international response to a major ongoing disaster. It is even more difficult to understand why last year an international grouping under the European Commission had to return £2.3 billion in unspent aid to the coffers of the countries it had come from. How can we have confidence in any international commitment to resolve the problems in Africa when that happens? It is only if we compare that inactivity with the effort and endeavours of our own voluntary agencies, the generous response of the Irish people and their impact at ground level, that we can realise the chaos and uncertainty in which people in stricken areas of Africa live.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that while Government agencies have failed, voluntary groups have been a success story. What is the Government doing to resolve the situation? It should be persuading international agencies and the EU to respond positively and meet their commitments by delivering money and other aid where it is most needed. What will the Minister of State do? I hope to hear her responding positively to that point in her reply to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It baffles me that in the Government amendment to the motion, the Minister &ldquo;commends the response of the Government to the crisis in Ethiopia&rdquo;. What action has the Government taken that deserves this commendation? In his opening speech, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said he <Col N="145" /> was delighted that the House was discussing this issue. There is not a topic we should less like to be discussing than the lack of delivery of aid to the people of East Africa, including Ethiopia and Kenya.</P>
    <P>Some 8 million people are on the verge of starvation in that region because malnutrition is rampant. Once more, people are on the move from rural to urban areas. That is typical of the demographic shifts that have gone on since 1984, yet there has not been a response from the international community, other than a token one. It was sickening to see the response of the EU Commissioner, Mr. Patten, tonight, when he quibbled over figures with his own aid agency, Oxfam, in Britain as to what they did or did not do. While that side-show continues, the people of Africa will continue to die. Some 15 million in a particular area are facing certain death if people like the Commissioner remain determined to gain political advantage rather than doing their jobs.</P>
    <P>I commend voluntary agencies, such as Trócaire, Concern and Oxfam which have done tremendous work. Irish volunteers who have gone abroad to work for these agencies have saved people's lives, but it would be wrong to say that this is something new. We should be grateful to the Irish and international media for having highlighted these issues. RTE can bring vivid, horrific pictures to our screens which shock us all into action once more. It is terrible that we have to rely on the media to goad us into action in response to the horrifying pictures we see on television.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will make a positive decision, a gesture that is becoming of the generosity of the people, that by 2007 it will meet the overseas aid target of 0.7% of GDP that has been set. We can afford it now, although there was a time when poor people here needed aid more than those in the developing world. At present, with our low unemployment, we can respond positively to this situation which requires urgent attention.</P>

      <P>I endorse the Fine Gael motion and I support the Labour Party amendment. The level of development aid from this State is a disgrace. This island is now among the wealthy nations of the world and part of the largest trading bloc &ndash; the European Union. Yet, the generosity of our people is not matched by the level of aid allocated on their behalf by successive Governments. No Government has been in a better position to ensure that the State reaches the UN target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from Ethiopia on RTE's <i>Six-One News</i> this evening, Fr. Jack Finucane of Concern said that &ldquo;we now have a golden opportunity to prevent a major catastrophe from taking place&rdquo;. Yet, we know that for many thousands and possibly millions, emergency aid will come too late.The obscenity of the casualty figures will be per<Col N="146" /> sonified on our television screens by starving children. How often is this to be repeated before we challenge the system of greed by which this planet is ruled?</P>
    <P>While the people of Mozambique were devastated by flooding, their Government was sending $1.4 million per week to its debtors. Where was the rapid reaction force to help those people as they clung for their lives to trees and roof-tops? Where is such a force for Ethiopia? The Irish Government, however, is prepared to be part of an EU military force of 60,000 with massive spending on armaments, as signalled by Javier Solana in Dublin last month. The Government is not in a position to criticise arms spending by Governments in Third World countries when it is preparing to bring us into such an army which will provide a bonanza for the arms industry. Mr. Solana told us that this force will be capable of staying in the field for up to a year. Just imagine what such a number of highly trained and equipped people could do with the same resources spent, not on arming them but on providing the means to work on long-term development and short-term emergency aid in Third World nations. It would be phenomenal.</P>
    <P>The debt burden is the first and foremost obstacle to progress and justice in the most impoverished parts of the world. The foreign debts of developing countries are growing at a rate that is simply out of control. Debts have risen for all developing countries, from a total of $610 billion in 1980 to $2.3 trillion in 1997. When the poorest countries are diverting precious resources from areas such as education and health to pay foreign creditors, economic logic as well as moral duty demands the cancellation of their unpayable debts. While the summit of G7 leaders in Cologne in 1999 agreed improvements to the existing framework of debt reduction, it did not go far enough to meet the fundamental objectives of debt cancellation. Equally their proposals on debt relief raised many concerns, including the fear that these countries will have to leap through even higher hoops to qualify for the debt relief on offer. The Cologne initiative will give little to a few countries and nothing, sadly, to many others.</P>
    <P>The poorest countries simply cannot meet their debt service obligations. Only half to two thirds of scheduled debt service is actually paid. The rest becomes arrears on the existing debt. The cost of cancelling unpaid debt is affordable and achievable. As a first step towards reducing poverty, injustice and inequality in developing countries, we need the comprehensive cancellation of unpayable debt and an independent and transparent process to ensure that these debts do not build up again. The lending nations, the IMF and the World Bank must write off these debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the <Col N="147" /> debate, I thank all the Deputies who contributed. The quality of the contributions is a measure of the increasing understanding and sincere support in this House across all parties for increasing the ODA budget to reach the UN target. There is also an appreciation of the need to focus not only on quantity, although that is crucial, but also on the quality of our aid programme. As to the fundamental objective of the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party, that is the need to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP as ODA, I assure the House that is the precise objective of the proposals which will shortly go before Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have separately indicated a timeframe similar to that outlined in the Fine Gael motion, but it will be essential to have an interim target as well. These proposals follow a comprehensive review of the aid programme. They will address policy and management issues. In the context of a substantially increased budget, this is crucial if we are to maintain the high quality of aid effectiveness for which we have received international acclaim. Already our ODA has grown fivefold since I992, but that was from a very low base. We are still far short of the UN target, to which we are committed. Nobody is more committed to that than I and the wording of the Government amendment clearly indicates that I am pushing for a specific timeframe by which we will reach the UN target. The real battle, as Deputies will know, will be at Cabinet, and it will be important that I have heard the cross-party support and that of the Opposition parties for this objective of reaching the UN target.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that development aid is a measure of a commitment to civilised values, as I have said before, and a vindication of the human right to development, development assistance actually works. Although there are still millions living in abject poverty, more human beings have escaped from poverty in the past 50 years than in the previous 500 years. The challenges are immense, and the Deputies know them. The burden of indebtedness on the least developed countries is chronic. The pandemic of AIDS has the capacity to reverse much of the development achieved in the past decade. The core value underpinning our programme has been a concentration on assisting the poorest countries and on poverty eradication, with particular emphasis on basic health care and primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister outlined the broad mix of our programme to build up the capacity of developing countries in human and economic facets so they can cope with crises. The current emergency in the Horn of Africa is one such example. We have been monitoring developments in the Horn of Africa for some years. We have been active in long-term development and food security work in Ethiopia since the fam<Col N="148" /> ine of the 1980s. Last year we allocated £800,000 to emergency humanitarian relief in the Horn of Africa. Today I have redirected £1 million from the Ethiopian country programme of £316 million for urgent relief activities. This is a one-off measure to address those most affected and to prevent the present unacceptable situation from developing into a major disaster. In addition, I have approved £500,000 more from the emergency humanitarian budget, which will be channelled through NGOs, including Concern and GOAL, which are active in the region. This will bring our emergency allocation to Ethiopia since December to £859,000.</P>
    <P>From the £1 million allocation, £250,000 will be given to the World Food Programme and £150,000 will be given to UNICEF for their immediate response. The remainder will be allocated largely to programme areas in Ethiopia and monitored by our embassy in Addis Ababa. Given the very grave news and reports from the area, the embassy is working closely with local players, NGOs and the Ethiopian authorities to identify additional resources which might be redirected without the present programme suffering in any way. I have taken steps with the Ethiopian authorities to stress the need for them to be flexible regarding visas, the importation of vehicles and emergency assistance, since many NGOs reported experiencing excessive bureaucracy while assisting with the delivery of humanitarian aid. I have also requested that the Ethiopian Government examine all means to increase port access for humanitarian supplies, including through Eritrea, where it has been suggested that a humanitarian corridor will be essential for food delivery to the northern part of the country. There are huge logistical challenges relating to the delivery of assistance quickly to those who most need it.</P>
    <P>Serious allegations have been made here and elsewhere that the European Commission has delayed in replenishing food stocks to the central reserve in Ethiopia. Some 30,000 metric tonnes from 1998 and 50,000 tonnes from 1999 have yet to be replenished. It is difficult to ascertain, even after several days, the veracity of these serious allegations against the Commission. The Commission defends itself robustly against the charges, yet the facts speak for themselves. Due to borrowings from the Emergency Food Security Reserve &ndash; EFSR &ndash; by NGOs and other agencies during 1999, the reserve was depleted and not replenished. These very serious issues must be accounted for by the European Commission and we will be raising them with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Last weekend the Taoiseach and I attended the first summit between EU and African Heads of State and Government, which was held in Cairo. The objective was to strengthen the partnership and future strategic relations between the EU and Africa. The discussions focused on a wide <Col N="149" /> range of areas such as debt, conflict resolution, human rights, globalisation and other aspects of a future strategic relationship between the two continents. The African countries stressed debt relief and called for the end to the marginalisation of many African countries from the global economy. Some irritation was expressed by the African community at the EU's perceived obsession with human rights and good governance. This is the beginning of a very serious engagement between the EU which is the biggest donor of humanitarian assistance and development co-operation and it is a very important partnership.</P>
    <P>I thank the House and Deputy Mitchell for raising this issue and for supporting the increase of our overseas development assistance to reach the UN target. As I said, nobody is more committed to that than I and nobody has been more critical of the Government's failure to reach that target. I will press at Cabinet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in the light of our review, to reach that specific target of 0.7% of GNP. There has never been a time that we were more fit, capable and rich enough to do so. I am committed, as the Deputies will know, to reaching and publishing that target, to phased increases over a clearly defined period of time to reach an interim target and also the UN target of 0.7%. I thank Deputy Mitchell. I listened with great attention to all the contributions made by Deputies and I thank them for their support.</P>

      <P>To my shame I am not as knowledgeable about the issue of Third World development and development aid as I should be. As the Ceann Comhairle knows, lack of knowledge on certain topics has never stopped other Deputies from speaking in the House and it will not stop me this evening. I will respond clearly to the Minister's speech because she made a number of comments which must be referred to very quickly. This is fundamentally an issue between charity or right and whether we believe that the UN commitment to which we signed up is a matter of charity or right. If we believe it is a matter of rights, we should prescribe it in law and if we believe it is a matter of charity, we should make some commitment to the future. I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on his work in this area. The net issue of his motion is that if we believe it is right that a minimum of 0.7% of our GNP is to be spent on development aid, then it is logical that that should be prescribed in law. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, described this as cumbersome. What a nonsense. If we believe this issue is important enough for <Col N="150" /> Ireland to take a stand on, then we must prescribe it in law.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said she and the Taoiseach want to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP as overseas development aid and this is the precise objective of the proposals that are shortly to go before Cabinet. Why then are we to divide the House tonight? The Minister of State has accepted the principle of the motion, yet we are to vote on it. That is an act of political hypocrisy. The Minister of State said she would use this as a resigning matter last year, but her bluff was called and she did not resign. The commitments she sought from the Cabinet were not adhered to. The Minister of State also said tonight, in an unscripted comment, that the real battle would be fought at Cabinet. She should tell the people through this House with whom that battle will be fought. Will it be with her senior colleague, Deputy Cowen, or champagne Charlie himself, the Minister for Finance? If we are all in agreement on the target, why are we voting on this matter and why is there such dissent in Government on it? The Minister is using the House, politics and Third World debt relief so that her party can be seen as a cog in the wheel of Government and that is a disgrace. Her response has not been a considered one given the cross-party support for this motion.</P>

      <P>Last night I set out my stall at length and it is now a matter of record. We all know the saying, &ldquo;pride comes before a fall&rdquo;, and one sees the pride in this Government when one reads its amendment to this compassionate and reasoned motion. That pride exists though statistics I quoted last night which show that approximately 350 million women will die before the age of 40. The Government congratulates itself on its approach to Ethiopia and Mozambique. What nonsense. Does the Minister of State think we could possibly vote for that sort of nonsense, having put down a decent motion? I kept away from party politics, but I find this response absolutely unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions and I thank Fine Gael for giving its Private Members' time last night and tonight to this motion. It shows that Deputies are not just interested in votes, as this issue will not get votes for anybody, though there is concern in this House about it. We have failed time and again to meet the so-called multi-annual budget and it is because there are not any Deputies from developing countries in the House. When every Department has to fight for its share of the budget, which will happen when times are not as good as they are now, we will still not reach the figure of 0.7%. Last year the Minister of State said we would reach the halfway mark of 0.35%, but we did not. She said that the method of calculating GNP had been changed. The Department of Finance and, I pre<Col N="151" /> sume, other Departments, knew that the method of calculation had been changed, but we were not told and again we failed to meet our targets. If that were not enough, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last night that one of the objectives which had been set by the UN and which the Government shared was to halve the proportion of the world's people living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. That is currently 22%, so we will only have 11% of the world's population living on less than a dollar a day in 2015. That is this Government's development policy, despite its huge annual budget surpluses.</P>
    <P>If anyone deserves praise it is the missionaries, the priests and nuns who gave their lives for little or no return and who now find it hard to find places to live when they return. We do not always recognise the good work done by these people, but when one of them errs they are all tarred with the same brush. We should record the decades of work done by them. They have given their lives to the poor. I also congratulate the NGOs. They are not without fault and I mentioned one point as delicately as I could: every time there is a famine or catastrophe Irish Red Cross, GOAL, Trócaire, Concern and others advertise. These organisations also have administrations and we will have to turn our minds gently to these matters. Those organisations are almost 100% funded by the Exchequer, EU contributions or directly by the public. I do not want to be critical of these people &ndash; they are doing a very good job &ndash; but we must raise this issue in a gentle way.</P>
    <P>Last night I referred to £2,340 million in unspent development aid being returned each year to the EU and the Minister did not deny it. Why has the Minister of State not brought that matter to the attention of the House in the past? The European Commissioner responsible for development aid has said that the EU policies toward the wider world are &ldquo;too numerous, too vague and incoherent&rdquo;, leading to &ldquo;very real inconsistencies&rdquo; between them. Why is that being allowed to happen? What is our Minister with responsibility for development aid doing at the Council of Ministers if that is happening? She knows the figures; I gave them last night and they are absolutely appalling. It is unacceptable at a time when we have unprecedented economic growth and a huge budget surplus.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was being instructed by him to bring in multi-annual budgeting in the overseas development aid area. I was surprised to hear it as that is what the Minister of State told us she was doing last year. I do not know if there is competition or disagreement in the Government parties on this matter, though the Minister of State has hinted at that in her <Col N="152" /> comments on the battle at Cabinet. The Taoiseach made that statement at this year's Ard Fheis. Are we to presume from that, that what the Minister of State said last year is incorrect and that multi-annual budgeting has not been in place? I do not think so. There is something inconsistent here.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should read the Taoiseach's speech to the Ard Fheis. He did not make that clear.</P>
      <P>Trócaire supplied me with &ldquo;The Progress of Nations&rdquo;, a document which states that nearly four in ten children under five in developing countries are stunted and that their stature is a symbol of their diminished potential. It goes on to state that because their capacity for learning is also reduced, they do less well at school and later in life, their productivity and earnings are generally lower than those of their better nourished peers. Like all malnourished children, they are more susceptible to disease. The document goes on to state that every minute a woman somewhere dies from pregnancy-related causes or in childbirth: almost 600,000 a year. Almost all of these deaths occur in developing countries. All of these deaths are occurring at a time when 14 million young children and 10 million older children and young adults in these countries are dying of easily and cheaply treated disease and malnutrition; 840 million people living in developing countries are malnourished; women represent 70% of all poverty stricken people in these countries, followed closely by the elderly; and approximately 79% of the world's population and more than 90% of the 35 million HIV and AIDS sufferers live in Third World countries. Life expectancy has increased from 76 to 58 years, per thousand live births, which demonstrates that development aid works because these improvements took place between 1960 and 1999. However, despite this, 1.5 billion people are not expected to survive to the age of 60 years. Some 340 million women will die before the age of 40 years and 2,600 million people lack access to basic sanitation. We are expected to congratulate the Government which has not, yet again, even met its half-way target.</P>
      <P>I opened this debate with a generous offer. I was generous in my comments and Fine Gael was generous in giving its time to this House, but the generosity ends here. This aid should be legislated for and provided. This placing of style before substance is obscene when these figures continue to prevail, particularly on the continent of Africa.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Facilities for Disturbed Children.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has failed to provide appropriate facilities for disturbed children as already ordered by the High Court in 1995. On 10 March this year Mr. Justice Kelly directed that a 17 year old girl be detained in the Central Mental Hospital, a hospital for the criminally insane. This happened despite an expert view that it was totally inappropriate and possibly illegal. Although considered to be of very serious risk to herself and others, the girl had no criminal record and was not insane. However, the judge had no option because of the State's failure to provide an appropriate facility or even a legislative framework to deal with such cases.</P>
      <P>On 24 March a child was back in the High Court five years to the day when Mr. Justice Geoghegan declared that the State had a constitutional obligation to provide &ldquo;as soon as reasonably practicable suitable arrangements for containment with treatment for troubled children&rdquo;. In a judgment in February, Mr. Justice Kelly said the State authorities could have been in no doubt about their obligations in this regard. He said it was clear that:</P>
      <P>on no occasion has there been adherence to the timescale indicated to me. In each case the provision of the facilities has been deferred further and further.</P>
      <P>In early March the case of a 15 year old girl who went out of control following the death of her mother was heard. After coming under the influence of truly evil people, as was stated in the case, she was said to have had 75 sexual partners while working as a prostitute, used her mobile telephone as a sex chat line, smoked 40 to 60 cigarettes per day and took drugs and alcohol. In spite of this she ended up in a State remand centre as there was nowhere else available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month an extremely disturbed 14 year old girl with a propensity to epilepsy was ordered to be detained in the acute psychiatric unit of a general hospital. She took an overdose of alcohol and 20 ecstasy tablets and was allegedly raped after staying out late from a health board residential home. She was also diagnosed as having a sexually transmitted disease. An expert said she immediately needed a secure residential environment where she could receive appropriate therapy and treatment from suitably qualified staff, but the child's life was in imminent danger and there was no suitable alternative. Mr. Justice <Col N="156" /> Kelly spoke of the appalling dilemma in which he was placed by the State and the failure of the Minister. He said &ldquo;it manifests itself week in, week out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Just four days before Christmas another 14 year old child, described by a psychiatrist as &ldquo;the saddest child I have ever met&rdquo;, with an alcoholic mother and a violent father who allegedly sexually abused her, and who had tried to kill herself on Christmas Day 1998, was sent to a State detention centre by the High Court. This is an innocent child who, in the words of Mr. Justice Kelly, never had a chance. She spent her 14th Christmas in a reformatory.</P>
    <P>Shortly before that a 16 year old boy with psychiatric and psychological difficulties but with no criminal conviction was sent to St. Patrick's institution, a prison, despite the view of the presiding judge that his continuing detention was unlawful and that the boy alleged he would be raped there. There would have been no surprise at this statement as in 1997 a 13 year old was warned by Judge Mary Martin that if she sent him there he would be locked up for 23 hours per day and would be raped every night.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that children treated in such fashion do not have a chance in life. Court observers have seen such children leave a court without a residential place. They often spot the same names four or five years later on bail applications. There is no doubt that the Minister and the State have totally failed. The Minister will claim credit for the construction of an inadequate building programme which would not have taken place without the stand of judges such as Mr. Justice Kelly and others.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for the opportunity to reply to this debate. I share his concerns about children who have to defend their rights before the High Court. It is an appalling vista to see children having to go before the High Court. Deputy Neville referred to the constitutional case without saying that it took place in 1995, and it is unfortunate that no progress was made either in the provision of places between 1995 and 1997 or in developing a plan for such provision.</P>

      <P>Since the Government came to office in 1997 it has invested £60 million in the development of our child care services, including new child and family support services such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context. This additional funding has allowed the health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places available from 17 in <Col N="157" /> 1996 to a current total of 63, which includes a number of individual high support packages.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the need to provide more places and to answer the needs of these children, the Department has approved health board proposals to develop 110 additional high support and special care places nationally. As part of this programme of development, seven additional places have already been created in the South Eastern Health Board and an additional eight place unit for girls has been opened and is being brought into operation on a phased basis in the Southern Health Board. These developments are included in the current total of 63 places.</P>
      <P>These plans are well advanced and provide for the development by the health boards of additional places nationally as follows: in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a purpose built special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan, commenced in January 1999 &ndash; it is anticipated that this unit will open in the summer of this year; the development of a 24 bed purpose built high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at tender stage &ndash; it is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001; the Midland, North Eastern, North Western and Western health boards are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. A site has been acquired and a project manager and project group have been put in place to develop the proposal.</P>
      <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: 20 high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board, three high support places in the South Eastern Health Board and five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a special care facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. All of these places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001.</P>
      <P>The senior managers' resource group, comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department, was established in October 1998 and continues to meet regularly to monitor the overall development of these services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville raised the issue of recent comments in the High Court of which I am very well aware. The recent judgment of the High Court concerning these matters is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and I do not think it appropriate to comment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I wish to make a number of points on the speed at which the programme of development of high support and special care can be undertaken and put in place by health boards. Because of the public perception of these services and some opposition from local communities, I understand from the health boards that sourcing <Col N="158" /> suitable sites or premises has been difficult. This also complicates and lengthens the planning process. The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult. Indeed, some health boards have had to recruit staff from outside the State.</P>
    <P>Against this background considerable progress has been made by health boards in putting this programme of development in place. However, I am conscious of the need to ensure that all developments are put in place as soon as possible and in line with the target dates which have been set by the health boards. I accept it is inappropriate for children to be placed in such places as the Central Mental Hospital and I am committed to ensure the availability of suitable places of care.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that last month I announced the establishment of a new interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection. I recently announced the membership of the board which will meet next month and which comprises representatives of the various Departments involved with children in special care. This body will advise the Ministers on the delivery and co-ordination of services. It will also advise on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities and in those facilities run by or under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science. The Bill before the House will ensure that early intervention will protect those children. I reassure the Deputy that the Department and the Government are committed to taking action in this area and making resources available for these children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>As a public representative, I do not condone people claiming social welfare benefits while working. However, I have raised this matter because last week a 52 year old man with two young children came into my clinic and cried. He had received a letter from the local social welfare office inviting him to attend the office. He was told that there was plenty of work out there and that he must obtain employment. However, he cannot read or write. The man is a manual worker and there is less of that work available now. The recent census highlighted that 23% of the population has difficulty reading and writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new directive has issued from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to disallow people social welfare benefits, allow them to appeal and then decide on their entitlement. That is a disgrace and it is arrogant but that arrogance emanates from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Last week the Minister for Finance told us that we should be joyous, cel<Col N="159" /> ebrate and have a party. Did he include the 52 year old man with two young children who cannot read or write and will never obtain employment?</P>
    <P>There is another section of society, about which all of us are aware. Many people left the education system in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s in order to look after the family farm and their parents and, therefore, they did not get the education they needed. They are now in receipt of social welfare benefits but the Government and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs are trying to remove them from the live register. It is a crying shame. These people are not fully educated but want to work. We live in a high technology world. New jobs are announced on a daily basis but if people want to take them up they must have the leaving certificate at least or a degree in most cases. However, we do not have enough qualified people and highly qualified foreigners are being recruited.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending that work is available for those who are not fully educated and there is no point asking people of a nervous disposition or those who are not able to take up employment but are not entitled to disability benefit to get work. A new category should be established by the Department to cover these people because they are caught in a trap. Why is the Government attacking the weak in society, people who are unable to fend for themselves? I am disappointed the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is not present but I can see where the arrogance is coming from. I call on him to issue a directive to his officials to stop them telling people that work is available and they must take it up.</P>
    <P>I would not mind if an appeals mechanism was in place which could deal with individual cases within two weeks. It sometimes takes between six and ten months before the appeals are heard and the people involved must seek financial assistance from the health board. It is no wonder that the health service is in disarray and that health boards do not have the money to address other problems. It is wrong that we are attacking the weak in society, including people who cannot read or write. Such people are expected to take up IT jobs.</P>
    <P>Departmental officials recently appeared before an Oireachtas committee and I was disappointed that I was not informed that they were coming in. I will write to the chairman of the committee requesting that the officials appear again because I want to attend the next meeting. I am sure many Members receive the same complaints I do, whereby people are told that work is available and they should go and get it. I would be ashamed to be a member of a Government which attacked the weak in society, including people who cannot read or write.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any allegations of arrogance on the part of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, any other Minister or the Taoiseach. The Deputy will accept that persons who are in receipt of unemployment payments must show that they fulfil the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work. There are also specific provisions in the Social Welfare Acts which provide for the disallowance of an unemployment payment for up to nine weeks where a person refuses an offer of suitable employment. The onus is on the claimant to demonstrate that he or she satisfies the conditions on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Claims are reviewed on a routine, systematic basis. During such reviews claimants are required to demonstrate that they meet the statutory requirements. In this regard they are asked to outline that they have taken reasonable steps to secure suitable employment. Detailed guidelines have issued to deciding officers and training has been provided. The guidelines set out the steps that an unemployed person is reasonably expected to take to find employment. Regard is taken of the person's age, physique, normal trade or profession, skills, family circumstances and any other relevant factor. This answers the Deputy's point regarding the skills of people who are attempting to obtain specific employment.</P>
      <P>The regulations and guidelines were drawn up following wide consultation with interested parties including, ICTU and INOU. Each case is examined on its merits and the deciding officer will have regard to what is reasonable in that case. Where a claim is disallowed by a deciding officer the person can appeal to the social welfare appeals office which acts independently.</P>

The improvements in the economy in recent years have meant that more job opportunities are available to the unemployed and it is important that persons in receipt of unemployment payments show that they are making efforts to obtain suitable employment. The Department is satisfied that the regulations are applied in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond on this issue. The EU Commission, in a reasoned opinion issued to the Government on 3 April, confirmed that the Irish Parental Leave Act of 1998 is in breach of the EU parental leave directive. The Act allows mothers and fathers to take up to 14 weeks unpaid leave from their work to take care of children up to the age of five.</P>
      <P>We speak a lot in this country about helping parents to combine work and family but the reality is that we do very little to help parents achieve that objective. We have the lowest provision of publicly provided child care in the EU &ndash; what I would call primitive maternity leave &ndash; with provisions which badly need to be updated and extended, no paternity leave and unpaid parental leave. The Government went further when bringing in this parental leave legislation and set a cut-off date which excluded many children and parents from benefiting from what the EU directive had in mind. Under the directive, leave could have been given to parents of children up to the age of eight. The Government chose the age of five and also contravened the directive by setting a date by which children must be born in order to be eligible.</P>
      <P>The formal notice first issued on 11 March 1999 to the Government states that the directive does not contain provision permitting member states to set a date by which children must be born and that by requiring children to have been born after the date of the directive's adoption, that is, 3 June 1996, the Government has added a condition which is not permitted by the directive. After the formal notice was issued in March, the Government did not accept what the Commission said but argued against it, and thus we have arrived at a situation where the Commission rejected the observations made by the Government and has issued a formal legal opinion, known as a reasoned opinion, confirming that the directive does not contain provision permitting member states to set a date by which children, in respect of whom the right to parental leave is exercised, must be born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions now arise. Does the Minister intend to take any action to cover those parents and children who have been unjustly <Col N="162" /> excluded and are now over-age? Will the Minister clarify what he intends to do now about changing the parental leave legislation? Does he intend to appeal the opinion or do the honourable thing and bring in the necessary changes?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to increase the parental leave available to parents of disabled children and extend the age of children whose parents can claim this leave up to eight years of age. The reality in Ireland is that we only have unpaid parental leave which in effect means that most parents will be unable to avail of it, unlike the position in a number of other EU member states. The complete resistance to any form of paid parental leave in this country is unacceptable and must be changed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide information &ndash; if not tonight then perhaps at a later stage &ndash; on the number of parents, male and female, who have been able to avail of the legislation to date. I would like to pay tribute to the work the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has consistently done in trying to ensure that Ireland's provisions in this area are of the highest quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this matter. As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission has issued a reasoned opinion to the effect that Ireland, by restricting the right to parental leave to employees with children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996, has not fully complied with its obligations under clause 2(1) of the framework agreement on parental leave annexed to Directive 96/34/EC, parental leave directive.</P>
      <P>Ireland welcomes the clarification provided in the reasoned opinion by the Commission and we intend to respond quickly on this issue. My Department is currently examining the reasoned opinion with a view to identifying the measures to be put in place to give effect to it. We are in consultation with the Attorney General's office in this regard. I assure Deputy Fitzgerald that every effort is being made to respond to the reasoned opinion as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>It might be useful at this point to refresh our memories on the rationale for the original approach taken in the legislation. I impress on Deputy Fitzgerald that the 3 June 1996 date was incorporated in our legislation in good faith. The parental leave directive puts into effect a framework agreement which was negotiated at European level by representatives of employers and employees. Member states were not actually involved in the negotiations on the requirements for parental leave. At the time of the preparation of the legislation it was considered, in view of the wording of the framework agreement, that the State's obligations under the directive applied only from the date our Parental Leave Act came into effect on 3 December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> It is also important to note that the decision to set the date of 3 June 1996 was rooted in the partnership process between the Government and the social partners in decision making. The parental leave legislation was drawn up in full consultation with the social partners. We considered that we were making a concession by providing for parental leave in respect of children born or adopted between 3 June 1996 and 2 December 1998. IBEC was opposed to any such concession, whereas ICTU wanted parental leave applied to all children under five, irrespective of their date of birth or adoption. The date of 3 June 1996 was a compromise between these two positions.</P>
    <P>The reasoned opinion which we have received now indicates that we have not fully complied with our obligations under the parental leave directive. This, however, does not take from the fact that our original legislation was enacted in good faith. The challenge which faces us now is to accept the reasoned opinion and take all reasonable steps to implement it. Deputy Fitzgerald has flagged an urgent need to review Irish parental leave legislation following the reasoned opinion. I stress again that Ireland welcomes the Commission's clarification and that action is being taken towards speedy compliance with its findings.</P>
    <P>My Department is in consultation with the Attorney General's office on the form which our response to the reasoned opinion will take and its advice is awaited. Initial indications are that it may be possible to amend the Parental Leave Act, 1998, by way of statutory instrument rather than by primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that my Department will conduct a review of the operation of the Parental Leave Act in 2001. I do not envisage that amendments to the Parental Leave Act which may take place as a result of the reasoned opinion will affect this timescale. In view of the timescale for compliance with the reasoned opinion, any amendments on foot of the reasoned opinion must take place independently of the review.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the clarification provided in the reasoned opinion by the Commission and intends to respond quickly on this issue. I and my Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, are examining all options for compliance. In view of our timescale for compliance, the action must take place independently of the review of the Parental Leave Act, on which there is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am confident this matter can be resolved expeditiously and satisfactorily for all concerned. The answer to Deputy Fitzgerald's question as to whether we will behave honourably in relation to the reasoned <Col N="164" /> opinion is that we will be consistent and behave honourably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, for coming into the House to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>While there are 185 places in children's detention centres funded and supervised by the Department of Education and Science and a further 63 places for disturbed children funded by the health boards, the residential services for disturbed and delinquent juveniles are totally inadequate. It is a regular occurrence that judges castigate the Government for failing in its responsibility to these children.</P>
      <P>I recently became acquainted with such a case, a truly sad and disturbing case, where a 14 year old boy, his parents and family are getting shoddy treatment from the organs of the State. This 14 year old boy has had a troubled few years. He became unmanageable at school and because of his delinquent behaviour he could not continue at that school. He became aggressive and unmanageable at home also. The health board was asked for help and support but unfortunately it was slow to respond and its efforts to provide real support were minimal.</P>
      <P>On the advice of the health board the parents reluctantly initiated criminal charges against their son. The District Court sentenced the boy to two years at Oberstown detention centre. Following a period of assessment at St. Michael's, the boy again appeared in court and, as is now a regular occurrence, no place could be found for him in Oberstown. For the past few weeks this boy has made weekly appearances in District Courts in the midlands, always accompanied by three gardaí, his parents, their solicitor and his own solicitor. He must take the day out to make the long journey down to the midlands. Despite the stated threat from the District Court judge that he will send this child to Mountjoy Prison, no place has been provided in Oberstown, to which he was originally sentenced.</P>
      <P>On his most recent trip to the District Court, he was locked up in a cell in the local Garda station in that midlands town. Let us not forget that we are talking about a 14 year old disturbed boy. His cell mates were, first, a middle-aged man who claimed to be in the IRA and told very colourful stories about his shooting and robbing escapades around the country. His second cell mate, a younger man, boasted of his skills as an armed robber. That child was left with these companions in that cell for up to two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> This incident, and this boy's case, give rise to a number of questions. First, who agreed that this was a suitable holding arrangement for this boy on the day of his court appearance in that town? Second, what efforts were made to find more suitable arrangements? Third, is it acceptable that such a vulnerable young person should be dragged up and down the country one day each week, with the obvious neglect of therapy, counselling and schooling? Fourth, did his assessment indicate that there would be a suitable detention centre in the UK catering specially for the needs of children such as this boy? Fifth, is the Minister in a position to confirm that the boy was not sent to this centre in the UK because the health board refused to pay the requisite fee of £40,000 per annum? Sixth, is it reasonable that this disturbed adolescent from a rural setting should be detained in Oberstown &ndash; whose inmates, on release, have a re-offending record of more than 80% &ndash;  with juvenile criminals, many of whom are very experienced, at an annual cost to the State in excess of £80,000? Seventh, why did the health board not intervene earlier?</P>
    <P>The boy in question comes from a decent family which is highly respected in its locality. His parents want the best for their child and they want him to receive the treatment to which he is entitled and which he deserves in order that he can be reintegrated into the local community. The State has failed this boy and his family. Despite the benefits of the Celtic tiger, he will be labelled a criminal rather than receive the therapy which would possibly enable him to play a responsible role in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this important matter. I am aware of the case to which he referred, his concerns and the fact that he has been in regular contact with the officials in the Department in the interests of the child in question. The Deputy referred to the fact that early intervention might have helped this child which is the ethos behind the Children Bill, 1999, which passed Second Stage today and which will set out a blueprint for a new and modem juvenile justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental principle set out in the Bill is the proposition that the imposition of custodial sentences on children should be a matter of last resort. In support of this principle, the Bill contains a comprehensive range of diversionary measures and non-custodial options which will be available to cater for children who come into conflict with the law or who are out of control and have special residential care needs. The key objective of the Bill is to ensure that children will receive the support they require before matters deteriorate to the point where the imposition of a custodial sentence is the only viable alternative. It is particularly sad, as Deputy McGrath indi<Col N="166" /> cated, that a parent should feel the need to press criminal charges against his child. One of the specific aims of the Bill is to ensure that the judicial process cannot be used as a means to obtain care for a child.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Bill, responsibility for accommodating all young offenders who have been convicted and sentenced to detention, will be a matter for the young offender centres operated by the Department of Education and Science. However, the objective will be that only children for whom the imposition of a custodial sentence is required as a last resort will be referred to these custodial facilities.</P>
    <P>There are five custodial facilities operated by the Department of Education and Science, four of which cater for young male offenders while one caters for young female offenders. Children would be under 16 years of age at the time of committal to these facilities and can be sentenced to detention for periods from two to four years. The centres also include a remand and assessment facility to which children can be referred for periods of up to three weeks .</P>
    <P>From time to time, difficulties can arise with accommodating an individual child in a particular young offender facility on the day that the initial placement is sought. I am aware that this was the case in relation to the young boy to whom Deputy McGrath referred. On the day of his committal, Oberstown was under particular pressure and places were not available. However, it is generally the case that such children are either subsequently placed in the nominated facility or in an alternative custodial facility. In the case in question, I understand the child is doing well in his current location.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McGrath's comment about children being sent to England, it is desirable that children should be kept within the care of the State but, more importantly, they should be held in a location where their families can visit and support them. Children should be given the type of care which will enable them to be reintegrated into their families and society.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Bill, the young offender centres will be required to cater for children sentenced to detention who have serious behavioural problems and would previously have been deemed to be unruly or depraved. Up to now, the centres have been entitled to make application to the courts to have such children transferred to the adult prison system. Under the Bill, however, the young offenders centres will be required to cater for children with serious psychiatric or other difficulties. To date, the centres have not been equipped to cater for the special therapeutic needs of such children. However, individual plans for the development and education of children will help to ensure that they are reintegrated into society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The Department of Education and Science has embarked on a major five year development plan which includes proposals for the refurbishment of existing facilities and the development of additional capacity. It also envisages the development of a high security unit for seriously disturbed offenders, the development of a pre-release unit for children nearing the end of their sentences and the development of additional places for young offenders. Overall, the plan envisages the development of up to 30 additional places for young offenders.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately the case that the need for custodial facilities to accommodate some children will continue to exist but the objective of the Children Bill is to deflect as many children as possible away from the courts and custodial sentences by making alternative support services available. A key issue here is the need to ensure the availability of suitable residential and day care facilities which can deliver the sort of educational and care services which children at risk require and which are delivered in the sort of disciplined environment which can be necessary in such cases.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in this area <Col N="168" /> and the health boards are in the process of providing 110 additional places in high support and special care units. The Department of Education and Science is also making education services available in all such facilities. These will make a major contribution to ensuring that children who are at risk and encounter serious difficulties receive the interventions they require without the necessity for their incarceration in a young offender facility. The special residential services board which I recently established will play a vital role in ensuring the effective and co-ordinated delivery of services for children at risk, both in terms of services provided for such children by the Department of Education and Science and the high support and special care units.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these developments facilitate the additional provision which is needed and services will be more co-ordinated in the future. I am confident that, by virtue of the Children Bill and the policy of early intervention and early support for children and their families, we can avoid having children coming into the care of the State. Where they do, however, they will receive the best care possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.27 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 April 2000.</P>

      <P>The current role of the National Centre for Partnership, as described in Partnership 2000, is the promotion of the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors through the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, recognising the progress which has been made, proposes a new approach signalled by a new title and role for the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It is envisaged that the centre will work with IBEC and ICTU in supporting the deepening of partnership, including through deliberation, consensus-building and dissemination, monitoring, research and analysis, and training and facilitation.</P>
      <P>This will enable the centre to contribute to a more effective tackling of the challenges of ensuring that enterprises, both public and private, are better equipped to adapt to change, including new forms of work organisation, underpinned by effective arrangements of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to initiate discussions with IBEC and ICTU on the detailed arrangements now that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been ratified.</P>

      <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services, which were published on 22 March set out the provisional outturn for 1999 expenditure and the estimate for 2000 expenditure for my Department.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn of £19.8 million for 1999 shows that my Department was well within its overall budget for the year, with savings on a number of subheads. In the cases of millennium celebrations and the Moriarty tribunal, some expenditure was deferred to this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the millennium, expenditure in 1999 was lower than was originally anticipated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved. There is a longer lead time on capital projects and the millennium office ensures that grants are not made until satisfactory progress has been made on such projects.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Moriarty tribunal, the ongoing work of the tribunal has meant that the bulk of the legal costs, which will arise following completion of that work, have not yet arisen.</P>

    <P>The Revised Estimate for 2000 for my Department is £85.294 million. This is an increase of £48.908 million on the abridged Estimate, which was published last November. The increase arises for the following reasons: the administrative <Col N="171" /> budget has increased to reflect the carry-forward of savings which my Department made in 1999; subheads which include a pay component have been adjusted to take account of the increases agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; the allocation for grants under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, has been increased by £150,000 &ndash; the additional allocation represents expenditure deferred from 1999; the allocation for commemoration initiatives has increased by £70,000, to reflect an additional allocation made by the Minister for Finance in the context of the budget; the allocation for the millennium celebrations has been increased to £23.2 million &ndash; this represents the balance of the £30 million allocation made by the Government to cover the years 1999 and 2000; £300,000 has been allocated to a new subhead which will cover the administration and other costs of the independent commission of inquiry being undertaken by former Chief Justice Hamilton into the bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk; £31 million has been allocated for multi-media developments, including the development of a new research and development institution, Media Lab Europe, and a multi-media village in Dublin; and £10 million has been allocated for the initial development costs of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

      <P>I met Mr. Charles Kennedy MP, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Mr. Lembit Opik MP in Government Buildings on Tuesday 28 March. We had a general discussion about the current political situation in Northern Ireland. I expressed my appreciation to them for the keen interest which they have shown in the process and I thanked them for their ongoing support for our efforts.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 31 March, I met Mr. Paul Murphy, Secretary of State for Wales and Mr. Rhodri Morgan, First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales. Our discussion centred on the potential for further developing co-operation between Ireland and Wales. We also discussed Northern Ireland related issues.</P>
      <P>I met separately with Mr. Gerry Adams and with Mr. David Trimble on Friday 31 March. I also met with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition on 5 April and with the Progressive Unionist Party on 6 April. The meetings were part of an intensification of engagement with the parties in order to overcome the current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that while clearly we are in a difficult situation, we continue to make considerable progress in the implementation of the Agreement. We have seen substantial reforms in the <Col N="173" /> equality and human rights area. In Northern Ireland, a human rights commission has been established and is now holding consultations on the possible contents of a bill of rights. These are huge advances. We look forward to the implementation of the proposed reforms of the police service and the criminal justice system. In this jurisdiction, the Government have enacted equality legislation. Legislation to establish a human rights commission is before this House.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are working intensively with the parties to resolve the difficult issues which we face. We all recognise the critical need to move forward and achieve the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last August, I accepted an invitation from the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to attend the United Nations Millennium Summit which is currently set to take place in New York <Col N="174" /> on 6-8 September next. In my letter accepting Secretary-General Annan's invitation, I indicated my hope that the outcome of the summit might be a serious and realistic programme to renew, revitalise and strengthen the UN for a new era.</P>
    <P>On 15 March 2000, the General Assembly decided that the summit's overall theme will be &ldquo;The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century&rdquo;. It also decided that the summit will be composed of plenary meetings and of four interactive round-table sessions. The themes for discussion at the round-table sessions have yet to be decided by the member states in New York. They will form the agenda for our discussions at the summit.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General presented his report for the Millennium Summit to the General Assembly on Monday 3 April. The report entitled &ldquo;We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century&rdquo; is intended to facilitate preparations by member states for the forthcoming Millennium Summit. It identifies some of the pressing challenges faced by the world's population and proposes a number of immediate priorities for consideration at the summit itself. Heads of State and Government are urged to take action in areas such as poverty, water, debt relief, education, HIV-AIDS, slum clearance, youth employment and information technology. The Secretary-General also urges the summit to make special provision for the needs of Africa, and to fully support Africans in their struggle to overcome the continent's problems. In addition, the Secretary-General calls for a renewed focus on conflict prevention and disarmament and on respect for international law. The adoption of a new ethic of conservation and stewardship of the environment is also identified as a priority. In my view, the report offers a broad and challenging agenda for consideration in the lead-up to, and during the summit. The Government will work to ensure the success of the summit.</P>
    <P>On 6 April, I wrote to the new Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Yoshiro Mori congratulating him on his appointment and wishing him well for the future. I also took the opportunity to express the sympathy of the Irish people for Mr. Obuchi's illness and our hopes for his recovery. I have also written to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, congratulating him on his re-election on Sunday.</P>

      <P>Regionalisation is extremely important for the democratisation of the arts.  The current arts plan is underpinned by an area based approach. The area based approach to planning is one in which the needs of a given area are addressed by developing integrated policies and services across all sectors. It seeks to maximise benefits through a planned co-operative approach combining elements of bottom up and top down activity and open to opportunity in a wider social context. It is important to highlight that nearly all local authorities now have arts officers who are co-funded by the Arts Council and work in close co-operation with it to promote the arts locally.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the Government is committed to facilitating the further development of the State's arts and culture infrastructure.  The previous programme of development under the cultural development incentive scheme, which was part funded by the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, has facilitated an increase in the number of arts facilities and venues in the regions, the provision of which will facilitate greater access and participation in the arts for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>I am at present finalising a new national support capital programme to assist further necessary development in this area. The new programme that I will be putting in place will have three strands &ndash; first, the provision of new regional, city and county projects to fill gaps in existing facilities; second, the redevelopment of existing arts and culture infrastructure; and third, the programme will assist the development of community based projects.</P>
      <P>The programme will have an application and assessment process and I hope to be in a position to formally launch the new programme and to make a call for applications in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once this programme is completed there will be a countrywide arts and culture infrastructure accessible to all. A wide choice of art forms should be accessible within a reasonable radius <Col N="176" /> for most citizens. Also the new infrastructure will ensure that artists, be they operating in the field of literature, the visual arts, drama or music, have many more outlets in which to express their talents.</P>

      <Quest>the action she will take arising from the recent report of the Heritage Council which found that important archaeological treasures were at risk due to inadequate site testing by archaeologists; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10901/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Heritage Council report &ldquo;Review of Archaeological Assessment and Monitoring Procedures in Ireland&rdquo; indicates that the standard of archaeological test excavation and of the reports submitted is not as high as would be hoped for. However, it is not entirely accurate to state that, as a result, important archaeological treasures are at risk since testing is just the first stage in the archaeological resolution of a site.</P>
      <P>Archaeological testing is carried out to determine the nature, extent and complexity of the archaeological structures, features or deposits that may exist on a development site. In the majority of cases, test excavations are carried out by machine-dug trenches to the top of stratified archaeological deposits. Any further excavation to determine the depth of the archaeology is carried out by hand. The report submitted on the results of the test excavation is used to determine the requirements for further archaeological excavations, avoidance of impacts or preservation<i> in situ</i> of structures or features.</P>
      <P>However, I should point out to the Deputy that in some cases, there may be mitigating reasons why there may be less than accurate results from testing. For example, in urban areas, it may not be possible to carry out adequate test trenching at an early stage in the development process because of the presence of existing structures on the site prior to their demolition or the sites may be small and there are neighbouring buildings. On large greenfield sites, the excavation of a number of narrow test trenches may not give an accurate picture of the archaeology as testing in such cases is a hit and miss affair &ndash; the stripping of topsoil under archaeological supervision is a more productive method in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been possible for my Department to maintain its programme of inspecting archaeological test excavations in line with the hugely increased pace of such excavation work taking place on foot of the upsurge in development activity in recent years. As a result, in a certain number of cases, it has proven difficult for private <Col N="177" /> sector archaeologists to maintain the required standard. At the same time, it is clear from the Heritage Council report that there is an increased demand from private sector archaeologists for advice and inspections by my own officials.</P>
    <P>However, the profession also needs to look at its own self-regulation and to ensure that proper standards are adhered to. It is to be expected that archaeologists will fulfil their role in a professional manner on foot of work licensed by my Department but unfortunately, this is not always the case. My Department cannot be held responsible for particular cases where sub-standard archaeological work by a licensed archaeologist is reported but licences can be, and have been, withheld subsequently if the terms and conditions of a previous licence have not been met by a particular archaeologist. It therefore remains a matter between the archaeologist and their client to provide an appropriate level of professional services while acting with the law.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am currently examining ways to address these deficiencies. I am in the process of recruiting additional archaeologists and considering a repositioning of existing resources so as to introduce a programme of systematic site inspections and I am confident that this will have a significant beneficial effect on standards. Other initiatives involving a streamlining of the licensing system, a series of seminars and a set of guidelines on procedures and standards to be followed would also be desirable and will be pursued in conjunction with my plans to take on the additional archaeologists.</P>

      <P>The question of a special tax allowance for islanders is basically a budgetary issue on which a final decision was to be made, one way or the other, in the context of the most recent budget. The Deputy will be aware that such an allowance was not introduced in that budget, and I do not propose to pursue the matter further at this stage. The ongoing and very substantial reform of the tax system, including lowering taxes has reduced the impact that such an approach would have. However, my Department will continue to assist in every other way possible to reduce the cost of living for island communities. The Minister of Social, Community and Family Affairs has informed me re the islander allowance that he has asked his officials to undertake a full robust analysis of the range of issues involved in order that the matter can be reconsidered in the course of this year.</P>

As indicated in my previous reply the National Museum of Ireland intends to display the national geological material in a proposed new building in Collins Barracks which it is envisaged should be available to accommodate exhibitions in 2003. The proposed earth science gallery will allow for the proper public exhibition of elements of the national geological collection for the first time in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, I believe, referring to an article published recently in the <i>Sunday Tribune. </i>A number of issues were raised in that article based on extracts quoted from a discussion document on communications which was released by this Department under the Freedom of Information Act. The discussion document had been compiled as part of the partnership process in the context of Partnership 2000 and circulated throughout my Department in July 1999. The journalist in question did not seek to clarify any of the issues with my Department, and her article did not take into account the full context in which the discussion document should be considered nor changes which have taken place since that internal document was first circulated. A letter of clarification sent by my Department to the <i>Sunday Tribune </i>subsequent to the publication of the article has not yet been published.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been through an enormous amount of change and re-structuring since its establishment in 1993 as the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. Since then the relatively small Roinn na Gaeltachta &ndash; with staff of about 70 and an annual budget of £21 million &ndash; was amalgamated with elements of the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; arts, cultural institutions and film &ndash; the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications &ndash; broadcasting policy &ndash; and the Office of Public Works &ndash; heritage policy. Full responsibility for the heritage operational areas &ndash; waterways, national parks and wildlife and national monuments and historic properties &ndash; was transferred to the Department mainly in 1996 with other areas of responsibility added more recently, namely the offshore islands, Genealogy and the Placenames Commission. Over a relatively short number of years it has grown and developed into the multi-functional Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with about 2000 staff working at over 100 locations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management at my Department was faced with the challenge of addressing the inevitable difficulties in bringing together and integrating such varied, fragmented and often geographically dispersed functions into a cohesive structure and to <Col N="182" /> provide the necessary infrastructure and systems, including communications systems, appropriate to such a large, complex and geographically dispersed Department. It was also recognised that organisational change, including improved communications, could not be implemented without full and frank consultation with the staff of the Department. The views of some staff as expressed in the newspaper article were expressed as part of these consultations and are an indication of the degree to which open communications are fostered within the Department.</P>
    <P>In addressing this challenge and as part of an ongoing process of re-organisation and change, the following steps have been taken which were not reflected in the article: a sophisticated information technology strategy has been developed with the assistance of an outside consultancy; computer systems and equipment has been largely standardised across the Department using the most up to date specifications; the partnership process set up under Partnership 2000 is well established; and a comprehensive communications strategy is being developed within the context of partnership. I am confident that as a result of these and continuing initiatives that communications systems appropriate to the needs of a large, complex and diverse Department will be put in place.</P>

      <P>I have read with interest the study prepared for the Arts Council by the International Arts Bureau on comparative study of levels of arts expenditure in selected countries and regions. In drawing conclusions from this study it is important to bear in mind the methodology used and the caveats on international comparisons detailed in section 2. In particular it should be borne in mind that the comparisons relate in general to the period 1995-97 and that certain elements of Irish Government policy in support of the arts have been excluded because it was not possible to quantify the extent of similar elements in other countries.</P>
      <P>For this reason, I do not wish to read too much into the position of Ireland in any international league table. The programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, gives a clear and positive commitment to the development of the arts in Ireland and since my appointment as Minister I have secured dramatic increases in funding for the arts using the definition employed in this study. I welcome this study which will contribute to future debate about appropriate levels of funding for the development of the arts.</P>

      <Quest>the reason no contracts were renewed with Duchás staff dealing with underwater archaeology since 9 February 2000; if she considers this to be satisfactory; the action she will take to ensure that such service continues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, difficulties have arisen with the way in which contracts for service have been used by my Department to provide services across a number of areas including underwater archaeology. Discussions are ongoing in relation to having the matter regularised and these have reached an advanced stage. I am hopeful of an early resolution but until such time as agreement is reached on all the issues, it is not possible to enter into any new contracts for service.</P>
      <P>The personnel engaged to provide underwater archaeological services had no direct contract with my Department. They were subcontracted by a contractor who terminated his services to us on 9 February 2000. For this reason, there was no contract available for renewal and for the reasons I have outlined, it was not possible to enter into any new contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> As a result, it has been necessary to temporarily scale down our activities in this regard. While this is not altogether satisfactory, a reduced level of service continues to be maintained. It is my intention to address these difficulties in the very near future through a combination of recruiting more archaeologists and deploying a number of them to the underwater archaeological unit. I also intend to reallocate resources from those at present available to me. I am confident that these measures will lead to a more efficient and effective service in the protection of the underwater archaeological heritage than existed heretofore.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 172 and 174 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State already has a sizeable portfolio of more than 700 national monuments and historic properties which are in the care of Dúchas, the <Col N="188" /> heritage service of my Department. The resources required to conserve and manage such properties are already considerable and continue to increase. While it is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to control all heritage properties, I am conscious of the need to support the protection of the heritage not in State care.</P>
    <P>The national heritage plan, which will be published later this year, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership, to include the use of the Planning and Development Acts, the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage and increased levels of training in skills and craft areas which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership. Owners of heritage properties may receive assistance under the conservation grants scheme announced last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and also under the provisions of the Finance Act in respect of maintenance works carried out to heritage properties which are open to the public.</P>

      <Quest>the EU directives for which her Department has responsibility which have yet to be implemented; those directives in respect of which the EU Commission has taken legal action or opened infringement proceedings against Ireland for non-implementation; the current position in regard to each of the directives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my previous replies to Question No. 89 on 1 February 2000 and to Question No. 17 on 2 March 2000, my Department has responsibility for implementing the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and the EU Birds Directive 79/49/EEC. Both these directives are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the EU Commission initiated legal action against Ireland for failure to transmit a full list of special areas of conservation as required under the EU habitats directive. When this Government came into office in 1997, I discovered that none of these sites was formally transmitted to the EU Commission. I also came to the conclusion that inadequate consultation with landowners and land rights owners had occurred and that the opportunity of landowners to avail of appeals procedures should be provided. Since coming into power I have established an independent board to advise me in respect of objections to the proposed designations submitted, on specific grounds, by landowners and land rights holders. In addition my Department has requested landowners and land rights holders to <Col N="189" /> establish liaison committees for each site as a forum where difficulties that may arise can be dealt with speedily.</P>
    <P>I have since transmitted 262 sites, 81.3%, to the Commission, but the list is still incomplete and the legal action is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I also intend to publish a list of marine sites in the coming weeks and these will be formally transmitted to the EU Commission when any objections to the proposals that may be received are dealt with. The Deputy will be aware that once sites are published they are protected under Irish law.</P>
    <P>The long-term viability of these sites for nature conservation purposes requires my Department to secure the co-operation of landowners and land users, prior to including lands in the European network of sites. Accordingly I do not propose to formally transmit any site until the objections relating to each one are dealt with.</P>
    <P>In addition a reasoned opinion has been issued in respect of overgrazing, particularly in regard to the Owenduff/Nephin Beg site in the context of the birds directive. Despite a full response outlining steps taken to deal with the matter, I have recently been informed that the Commission intends to pursue legal action.</P>
    <P>Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 097/36/EC Television Without Frontiers promotes the free flow of broadcasting services across national boundaries by means of cable and other transmission systems. A reasoned opinion dated 9 July 1999 was issued by the European Commission against Ireland for non-implementation of Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that this Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 097/36/EC has been implemented, my Department has had no communication from the Commission since notification of our measures taken to implement the directive.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, an underwater archaeology unit was set up for a three year period in 1997 to undertake a sites and monuments record for maritime wrecks.</P>
      <P>A desk top survey of recorded wrecks off our coast has now been completed and will form the basis of a record of monuments and places &ndash; RMP &ndash; for the purposes of section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment Act), 1994. Any person proposing to carry out or to cause or to permit the carrying out of any work in relation to a site of a historic wreck contained in the record of monuments and places will have to give me two months advance notice of the proposed work.</P>
      <P>I must point out, however, that about 75% of the wrecks listed in the inventory are not site specific. They have been located only to the general area of the wrecking. The survey has produced documentation for more than 10,000 wrecks in Irish waters and as systematic recording of wrecks only really began in the 18th century there may be a further substantial number of unrecorded wrecks dating back to the medieval period and earlier. These can only be identified and protected through dive surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All wrecks over 100 years old are protected by section 3 of the National Monuments (Amendment ) Act, 1987 which provides blanket protection for these wrecks but also enables protection to be given, in the form of an underwater heritage order, to any other specific wreck. Any dives on protected wreck sites are subject to <Col N="192" /> licensing under section 3(5) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>

      <P>During the year 2000 Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department intends to continue the programme of upgrading and provision of signage and information panels at national monument sites which was initiated some years ago. Since the programme commenced, information panels have been provided at over 350 individual national monument sites. When the programme is completed, appropriate signs will have been provided at all of the national monuments which are in State ownership.</P>
      <P>While a specific allocation of funds has not been made for the implementation of the programme, the necessary funding is being made available from the general allocation for the conservation and presentation of national monuments within the Vote for my Department. In 1999, information panels were provided at approximately 84 individual national monument sites. Examples of such sites are Ballynacarriga Castle, County Cork; Mellifont Abbey, County Meath; Quin Abbey, County Clare; Ennis Abbey, County Clare and Kilfane Church, County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>A survey of visitors to fee-paying heritage sites managed by the heritage service of my Department carried out in 1999 showed that where visitors had complaints in relation to the site the absence of adequate road directional signs was one of the most frequent criticisms made. In view of this and the traffic movements generated by the 2.3 million fee-paying visitors to my Department's sites, a programme to upgrade road directional signs was initiated last year. So far surveys of over 30 such sites have been completed and the new signs will be provided in consultation with the local authorities. It is intended that signs will also be provided at all other fee-paying sites. In addition, signposting was provided to all of the national monuments for which my Department has responsibility in the Burren region of County Clare. Consideration will be given, subject to the availability of resources, to the extension of this programme to all of the heritage sites under the control of my Department.</P>
      <P>As regards the cultural institutions, the position is that signage requirements are dealt with on an on-going basis between the relevant institution and the Office of Public Works. As various projects are undertaken at each institution, signage needs are identified and provided as appropriate. Such works continue in 2000.</P>

      <P>As Minister with primary responsibility in relation to the heritage, I initiated the preparation of a national heritage plan in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The national heritage plan will provide, for the first time in the history of the State, an integrated plan for the protection of the heritage. It will set out strategies for the protection, conservation, management and presentation of the natural heritage, the architectural and archaeological, movable and immovable heritage, the inland waterways of the State, and documentary and archival heritage.</P>
      <P>Having carefully examined and analysed over 350 public submissions which were received as part of a broad public consultative process, my Department is now finalising a draft national heritage plan. It is my intention to circulate the draft plan to other Departments for their comments as soon as possible and I anticipate that I will be in a position to publish the national heritage plan later this year.</P>

      <P>A sum of £500,00 has been earmarked by my Department, towards the <Col N="195" /> cost of the development of the proposed Galway Civic Museum. At present, plans are being prepared for the museum by the Office of Public Works, but I believe they are not yet finalised. I am aware that Galway Corporation made an application, in 1997, to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation seeking funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism, but that all funds available under the programme had been committed at that stage.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that Galway County Council is now seeking an increased commitment. I am at present finalising a new capital support programme to assist further necessary development of the State's art and culture infrastructure. The new programme will have three strands &ndash;  first, the provision of new regional, city and county projects to fill gaps in existing facilities, second, the redevelopment of existing arts and culture infrastructure, and, third, the development of community based projects.</P>
      <P>The programme will have an application and assessment process and I would hope to be in a position to formally launch the new programme and to make a call for applications in the near future. It will then be a matter for Galway Corporation, as project promoters, whether to pursue an application for additional grant assistance for the proposed Galway Civic Museum under this new scheme.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the heritage council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance including financial assistance in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the heritage council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May 1998, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the package of proposals for strength<Col N="196" /> ening the protection of the architectural heritage. That package, which is being progressively implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms, rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As part of the package, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Since June 1997 I have considered 124 applications for a determination. Of these, 92 were granted and there were 32 refusals.</P>

      <P>In 1990 Wicklow County Council proposed to widen the N11 primary route through the Glen of the Downs so that the traffic on this section of roadway could be accommodated safely. Wicklow County Council report that an average of 25,000 cars used the road in recent years, and that section of the N11 has a tragic history of more than 100 accidents resulting in the deaths of five people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Wicklow County Council consulted the then National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, now part of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, the Office of Public Works made known their concerns about the potential impacts of the originally proposed road scheme on the Glen of the Downs nature <Col N="197" /> reserve. Wicklow County Council revised their plans several times so as to lessen the impact of the road on the site by realigning it and reducing the width of the road. The courts have found that the environmental impact assessment procedure and the consultation procedure required by section 12 of the Wildlife Act were correctly followed. Following extensive consultation and agreement on mitigation measures the Office of Public Works agreed to the scheme proceeding.</P>
    <P>Some 0.68 hectares of land, 1.5% of the area of the nature reserve has been taken and less than 450 trees including scrub and exotic species from an estimated 80,000 in the Glen are being felled to allow for the road development. In return the county council will give at least 0.74 hectares to the nature reserve as well as planting 6,000 native oak trees grown from seeds collected in the Glen of the Downs. Some 87% of the improved road through the glen will be built over existing or former road surfaces.</P>
    <P>Trespassers have caused damage to the nature reserve by digging tunnels and erecting treehouses on Dúchas land which pose a serious risk to the safety of Dúchas staff and visitors to the Glen. It is for these reasons that the nature reserve has been closed to the public since December 1999. As trespassers have refused to leave the nature reserve legal proceedings have been initiated.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the SAC Alliance Action Group. I have also had meetings with several representatives of parties who have an interest in raised bog special areas of conservation as has the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
      <P>Officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, have held meetings in nine raised bog SACs to form liaison committees. These committees are the first point of consultation between Dúchas and landowners on matters relating to the designation and management of SACs. Liaison committees also provide a member who will represent the landowner on the special area of conservation appeals board in cases in their area which come to be considered by that body.</P>
      <P>Officials have also met with individual cutters who have indicated a wish to discuss their particular cases.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 31 raised bog SACs in 12 counties. If the Deputy has a specific bog or area in mind, I could possibly provide him with more details regarding that area.</P>

      <P>I will forward a list of conservation rangers to the Deputy shortly. This list will include district conservation officers and other supervisory grades. It will also show the contact numbers he requested.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there has been an unprecedented recruitment drive for conservation rangers in the past two years, which should be completed this month. There will then be a national network of 90 conservation rangers with 29 supervisory officers.</P>
      <P>The remit of the conservation ranger is best summarised in the job description, a copy of which is also available for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Briefly it covers: enforcement of the Wildlife Act, 1976; implementation of the European birds directive and habitats directive management of State lands (nature reserves, national parks) for conservation, including supervision of public use of these areas; monitoring conservation areas; liaison with local communities and landowners; wildlife surveys; giving talks and lectures to schools and other groups.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal to extend the remit of the conservation ranger to include the reporting of damage to national monuments.</P>
      <P>The conservation rangers are very well equipped for their duties. All rangers have vans plus access to four wheel drive vehicles as required. They all have high quality professional and safety equipment such as protective clothing, binoculars, mobile telephones and professional text books. The cost to my Department to equip each field officer at the outset is in the region of £10,000 and the highest of standards apply.</P>
      <P>All new rangers are given training in professional subjects and health and safety matters amounting to 15 weeks in the first three years of service and in service training for rangers is also available on an ongoing basis. I am satisfied that all the necessary resources are available to the rangers to enable them to carry out their duties in a professional manner.</P>

      <Quest>the information she has regarding the legal action being brought against Ireland before the European Court of Justice for failure to inform the commission about protected sites by the June 1995 deadline and delaying the establishment of Natura 2000.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware this matter is <i>subjudice</i> and consequently my response must be limited.</P>
      <P>The habitats directive requires member states to propose, on the basis of specified scientific criteria, relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation &ndash;SACs. It also obliges member states to protect their favourable conservation status and to transmit a list of the proposed areas, together with full information on each site, within three years of the date of the notification of the directive&ndash;by June 1995&ndash;to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97). The main part of Ireland's SAC network has, since March 1997, been publicly advertised for SAC designation and receives legal protection in Ireland from that date.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has instituted proceedings against Ireland in the European Court of Justice for the non-transmission of special areas of conservation to it within the timescale set out in the directive. The Commission has been informed of all the sites that I have advertised for designation.</P>
      <P>The European Commission agrees with me and with the Government that the viability of the Natura 2000 network of sites is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. I believe that all those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation must be given an opportunity to object to the proposals on scientific grounds before I formally transmit the list to the Commission.</P>
      <P>To this end I have provided an opportunity to landowners and to land users to have their appeals examined informally by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I have also established a formal independent board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and comprising representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations, to independently assess appeals and to advise me on these matters.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has been notified of our proposals in relation to SACs and the reasons for the failure to meet the deadline for transmission of the list of sites to the Commission. The Commission is also aware that, while Ireland is technically not in compliance with the directive, the advertised sites receive full protection under our national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> I anticipate that prior to the completion of the legal proceedings Ireland will be in full compliance with the directive.</P>
    <P>The delay in transmitting the Irish sites is not the sole delaying factor in the establishment of the Natura 2000 Network. No member state in the Atlantic region, of which Ireland is part, has provided a full and complete list of these sites to the European Commission. The Commission will examine the situation again at the next Atlantic region biogeographical seminar in October 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has formally transmitted 262 SAC sites to the Commission leaving 60 sites to be transmitted when appeals have been dealt with. I also propose to advertise additional, mostly marine, sites later this month.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the work, research and recommendations carried out by a company (details supplied) for the Heritage Council in 1999; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the company, which is funded by the Heritage Council from its allocation of funds from my Department's Vote, is, through archaeological and related research, to work towards a coherent and comprehensive picture of human life in Ireland from earliest times and to publish the results of this research scientifically and in ways that can be appreciated by the general public.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1999 the company continued work on four of its original long-term research projects: the north Munster project, the Ballyhoura Hills project, the western stone forts project and the Tara literary project. I understand that these projects are due for completion at the end of 2000. In addition, two new projects were commenced: the medieval rural settlement project, in May, and the lake settlement project, in November. Work was also progressed on a research strategy document, due for completion within the next month, that will outline recommendations for a second phase of research relating to Tara.</P>
      <P>The company also continued its pioneering use of new technologies in the field of archaeological research and, through the use of geophysical surveying, a previously unknown and significant new enclosure, possibly dating to the late neolithic period was discovered on the Hill of Tara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two publications appeared during 1999: the company's report 5, and Mooghaun, a guide booklet about the important hillfort near Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, which had been excavated between 1992 and 1995 as part of the north Munster project. Information panels exploiting this recent research were also prepared by the north Munster project team for erection <Col N="203" /> by Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, along an archaeological trail opened at Mooghaun last September. Similarly, members of the western stone forts project team prepared the information panels reflecting their most recent research for the new visitor centre at Dún Aonghasa on Inis Mór. A team from the company had excavated this site between 1992 and 1995, as well as the nearby monument at Dún Eoghanachta.</P>
    <P>Three other research monographs were brought to near publication stage. These were a study of the Bronze Age artefacts of the north Munster area; a pioneering and highly productive study of the inter-tidal zone of the Shannon estuary; and an investigation of the destructive excavations&ndash;a century ago&ndash;by the British-Israelites at Tara in pursuit of the &lsquo;Ark of the Covenant'. In addition, staff of the company published papers relating to their work in a wide range of academic and popular publications, as well as lecturing at conferences in Ireland and abroad and to local societies and student groups.</P>
    <P>A travelling exhibition illustrating the work of the company was displayed in Belfast, Derry, Baile an Fheirtéaraigh and Limerick. As a result of its display in the latter city, a joint educational project was devised with the Hunt Museum that will involve both adults and children and will draw attention to the research activities of the company and, in particular, to the sizeable amount of important research which it has conducted in the mid-west region.</P>

      <P>The site is entered in the record of monuments and places for County Waterford, thus affording it protection under the National Monument Acts, 1930-94. This requires the owner or occupier to give two months' written notice to my Department of any proposals to carry out works at the site.</P>

      <P>The women's history project, funded by my Department, was established in 1997 to survey and record sources relevant to the history of women in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Progress to date on the project has been substantial. In the autumn of 1999 volumes two and three of the Drennan-McTier letters were published. In association with the National Library of Ireland the women's history project published &ldquo;If Ever You Go To Dublin Town&rdquo;, photographs by Elinor Wiltshire and a directory of sources for women's history in Ireland in CD-ROM form. Work on the files of the Department of the Taoiseach, which are in the custody of the national archives, continues. As of early April this year 667 boxes out of 1,400 had been examined and 10,000 entries have been made to the directory database.</P>
      <P>Later this year, a calendar of the papers of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council is to be published by the project and the directory of sources for women's history is to made accessible to the public through the World-Wide Web. The project is also editing, with a view to publication in 2001, the diaries of Elizabeth Dillon, wife of the leader of the 19th century Irish Parliamentary party leader, John Dillon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Motorists in this country are legally obliged to hold third party motor insurance. Irish insurers accept or reject individual risks on the basis of their underwriting experience. If a motorist experiences difficulty in obtaining a motor insurance quote, one can be sought through the declined cases committee, which was established <Col N="206" /> in 1981 under an agreement between the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the authorised motor insurance companies, to consider risks which have been refused by individual insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Many of the motorists who use the declined cases agreement are forced to do so because of their poor claims record and-or motoring convictions. However, under the agreement the declined cases committee is empowered to intervene if it considers that a quote charged under the agreement procedure is so high as to be tantamount to a refusal of cover. If the committee considers a complaint is valid in this regard it may indicate a maximum premium to the insurer along with other terms that may be imposed.</P>
      <P>The committee is composed of representatives from insurance companies under the chairmanship of the Irish Insurance Federation. The authorisation to carry out motor insurance business in the State is subject to participation in the declined cases agreement.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that before a case may be considered under the agreement, it is necessary to forward five written refusals from motor insurers directly to the Irish Insurance Federation indicating the order in which the companies were approached together with details, where applicable, of previous insurance held.</P>
      <P>The declined cases committee may, at its own discretion, refuse to instruct an authorised insurer to offer a quote for a particular risk if it is considered to be contrary to public interest to do so. The most recent returns available show that between 1994 and 1999 the declined cases committee processed more than 2,000 claims which were broken down as follows:</P>

      <P>A special inter-agency group was established in February 2000 to examine and respond to the needs of the employees of AT Cross and to promote job creation in Ballinasloe. The focus of the group <Col N="207" /> is to seek to assist in the attraction and generation of new businesses to the area. The group has met on four occasions to date.</P>
      <P>AT Cross is co-operating fully with the inter-agency group and is assisting IDA Ireland to market the facility for a new industry. Prior to and since the establishment of the inter-agency group in February 2000, there has been a number of IDA site visits to Ballinasloe and the IDA is hopeful that a positive outcome will emerge from the increased marketing focus on the town.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has recently developed a 39 acre business park in Ballinasloe and work has been completed on a 27,000 sq. ft advance factory which is now available for marketing.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland recently co-ordinated an enterprise evening, on behalf of the inter-agency group, with the view to stimulating potential business entrepreneurship. In addition to Enterprise Ireland, the following were present: FÁS, Galway City &amp; County Enterprise Board, Leader, Westbic, Teagasc, Ireland West Tourism, VEC and the  Chamber of Commerce.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I have previously detailed the harmonised EU rules on veterinary checks which apply to imports of poultry products. Third countries wishing to gain approval to export to the EU must satisfy the European Commission that their legislation and controls offer equivalent consumer protection to that applying in the EU. Such equivalance agreements also permit EU inspection visits by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission to be carried out in the third countries to verify that the common controls and monitoring requirements as required under EU legislation are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the commission checks in third countries, together with the checks carried out in member states on third country imports, have to date proved effective in safeguarding public health. However, as I have no responsibility for the functions of the FVO, I would sug<Col N="219" /> gest that questions relating to the level and intensity of checks carried out by them should be directed to the European Commission.</P>

      <P>In spite of an agreement in relation to live cattle exports signed with Libya in July 1998, there has been a delay on the part of the Libyan authorities in putting it into effect. This delay has been a matter of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact has been maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every appropriate channel, with a view to ensuring that the agreement is implemented in practice. I visited Libya in August last year, which in turn was followed by correspondence from the Taoiseach to the Libyan Leader. In November 1999, I wrote again to the Libyan Minister for Animal Wealth in this matter. The Irish ambassador to Italy, who is also accredited to Libya, visited Libya last month to raise the question of the live cattle trade. The Taoiseach raised the matter again in a meeting with the Libyan leader at the recent Africa Europe Conference in Cairo.</P>
      <P>Therefore, every possible avenue is being pursued to ensure that the agreement of July 1998 is fully implemented in a way that allows the resumption of cattle exports to Libya at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Under clause 36(a) of the terms and conditions of the 1999 cattle headage scheme, payment of cattle headage grants will be refused where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of the Disease of Animals Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>The TB-free status of the herd of the person named was withdrawn because of the failure to test cattle in his possession, for two years from 1 November 1997 to 28 October 1999, at a time when there was a high incidence of TB in his area. My Department wrote to the person named on 18 June 1999 advising him that it was his responsibility to ensure that all bovines in his possession had an annual TB test, and that none had been carried out in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote again to the person named on 15 October 1999, informing him that <Col N="220" /> because his herd had not been tested since November 1997, his herd number was being suspended. He was also informed that because he had not surrendered all cattle identity cards in his possession, as requested by an authorised officer, he was in breach of the Disease of Animals Act, 1966, and payment of his 1999 cattle headage grant was withheld.</P>
    <P>The person named had a clear TB test on 28 October 1999, and he was advised by letter of 9 February 2000 that if he had another clear test within 60 days of the last TB test he would regain his TB-free status. He was also requested again to surrender all cattle identity cards in his possession and was advised that failure to do so was an offence under the Disease of Animals Act, 1966. To date the person named has not had his herd tested nor has he surrendered his cattle identity cards. Until this matter is resolved, payment of cattle headage grants cannot be considered.</P>

      <P>As part of my Department's research and in response to ongoing requests from the farming organisations, a small percentage of the badger population is removed each year under licences approved by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. During 1999, up to 20% of the badgers removed under licence displayed evidence of being infected with TB. The objective in this regard is to find a solution that will provide protection for both bovines and badgers.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, it was agreed to commit staff resources in each district veterinary office to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdowns including, <i>inter alia</i>, further research into the role of badgers. A proactive approach to the removal of all sources of infection will be taken in each DVO area using 75 dedicated personnel, of which 48 are expected to be from the farm relief service. Their efforts will be concentrated in 20% of the country which yields 50% of current TB reactors. The detailed measures involved will be finalised over the coming months in the context of the animal health forum.</P>
      <P>Applications for licences for badger removals are made following evaluations by veterinary inspectors of relevant information regarding likely sources of infection in particular breakdowns, and licences generally include conditions relating <i>inter alia</i> to area involved, duration, means of capture, frequency of inspections, etc.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that badgers are removed with the minimum of stress and my Department's staff are sensitive to the issue of breeding badgers in regard to the timing of the field operations.</P>

      <P>As already advised to the House, following publication of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-Country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;, the South Eastern Health Board decided to carry out a root and branch review of the structuring and operation of adoption services in the region. The review was completed in January 2000. Following completion of the review and a series of inquiries regarding intercountry adoption services in the region, I arranged for officials of my Department to meet South Eastern Health Board management. The meeting took place on 16 March last.</P>
      <P>At the meeting the board indicated that steps are being taken to implement recommendations contained in the review of adoption services for the south eastern region and the following developments were outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> At the end of January 2000, there were 62 applicants on the waiting list for adoption assessment in the South Eastern Health Board area. It is envisaged that between now and the end of the year, based on current staffing arrangements, 30 assessments will be completed. This board will also be complying with the recommendations of the Adoption Board in relation to the fast tracking of second assessments.</P>
    <P>The board has assigned regional responsibility for adoption services to a child care manager. It has begun a recruitment process for additional social work staff and has tentatively agreed an appropriate structure for the adoption team, pending finalisation of the outcome of the recruitment process.</P>
    <P>All social workers are taking part in training in Cork at the beginning of April to provide courses for education-preparation stage. The target set is that a training course will take place in each community care area by the end of June 2000. It is envisaged that eight couples will attend a training course in each area. Further training courses will be provided in each community care area between September and December. Therefore, it is envisaged that 64 couples will have participated in the information and training course between now and the end of the year. The remaining couples on the waiting list will attend a training and information course in early 2001.</P>
    <P>The board pointed out that once the social workers commence the assessment, these are being completed over a period between six and nine months. In addition, the basic principles of the standardised model are already informing practice at local level.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board and, indeed, some other boards have come under increasing pressure to facilitate the early assessment of couples who claim to have a pre-existing relationship with the foreign child they intend to adopt. In the first instance, two issues must be resolved by the Adoption Board, i.e, the eligibility of the child for adoption and the compatibility of adoption law in the country of origin for the purpose of recognition of the adoption order under the Adoption Act, 1991. In addition, the manner in which the child originally entered the State, if she-he is already resident here, may involve other authorities. Once these issues have been clarified, the individual health board has then to consider the case made.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, the board has advised that a completed application was received by the adoption service on 21 December 1999. Currently the couple is 28th on the waiting list for the Carlow-Kilkenny area and those at number six to eight on the list are currently being assessed. The board has advised that it is its current policy that applicants take their place on the waiting list and are assessed as they fall due.</P>
    <P>While I am sympathetic to couples facing delays in these circumstances, I consider that health boards and their health professionals are best placed to assess these cases on their merits. <Col N="225" /> In addition, I am satisfied that the board is making considerable efforts to streamline the assessment process and increase the throughput of applications. Together with an increased complement of social workers, these measures should bring about a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed in the south-eastern area in 2000.</P>

Recommendations to the Minister on new RDAs were made recently by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recently pub<Col N="226" /> lished a document termed &ldquo;A guide to the definition of a medicinal product&rdquo;. In this document it states that vitamins and minerals are considered as medicinal products when the labelling or accompanying or associated literature makes any preventative, curative or remedial claims or the recommended daily intake calculated with respect to any of the added vitamin or mineral constituents exceeds the maximum recommended daily dietary allowance for such constituents.</P>
    <P>Medicinal products as defined above are authorised by the Irish Medicines Board on the basis of the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. There are special warnings, contraindications that apply to some of the vitamins and minerals &ndash; use of iron in children &ndash; and these are included on the individual licences.</P>
    <P>A White Paper on Food Safety was introduced on 12 January 2000 by the EU Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. David Byrne.

    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> It is too early to judge whether this will continue in the longer term and what if any implications this might have on the future of medical audit. However, I believe that informed consent from next-of-kin is essential in all future non-coroner post-mortem examinations.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. I do not propose to seek to repeal this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure have been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine of The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those <Col N="229" /> required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>A side effect of too much fluoride ingested in early childhood while teeth are forming is dental fluorosis. This effect was always known and was accepted as a trade off against the dental benefits. The period of maximum risk is two to five years of age. Drinking fluoridated water within the range 0.8 &ndash; 1.0 ppm gives rise to a very small percentage of the population having fluorosis of a mild to a very mild category. This type of fluorosis is almost invisible to the untrained eye. The statutory dosing parameter for fluoride is the level at which the greatest protection against dental decay is achieved while at the same time minimising the risk of fluorosis. The greatest risk factor for fluorosis in children is children's frequent swallowing of amounts of fluoride toothpaste greater than the size of a pea.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation estimates that approximately 210 million people in 39 countries benefit from artificially fluoridated water. An additional 40 million benefit from water supply which is naturally fluoridated.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, has awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Cork to advise health boards on an up-to-date status report on all aspects relating to fluoride use including water fluoridation. When advice and recommendations are available from these bodies appropriate consultation will take place to inform future policy on fluoride use for this country.</P>

      <P>At the 105th session of the WHO executive board, held in January 2000 in Geneva, the WHO announced a plan for the expansion of its food safety programme in response to new challenges in food safety. In this context, WHO has given an undertaking to define what research is needed to determine whether there may be any positive or negative health implications arising from the consumption of genetically modified foods.</P>
      <P>In her Report on Food Safety dated 2 December 1999, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of the WHO, stated that the issue of modern technology including biotechnology is to be addressed by WHO.</P>
      <P>In its agenda for the future, WHO has committed itself to, <i>inter alia,</i> support and provide the scientific basis for decisions regarding genetically modified foods through the addition of a specialised staff member, and in so doing, specifically address human health considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its 105th meeting, the executive board of the WHO recommended that the 53rd World Health Assembly, due to meet in Geneva in May, adopt the following resolution: &ldquo;Aware of the increased concern of consumers about the safety of food, particularly after recent foodborne-disease outbreaks of international and global scope and the emergence of new foods derived from biotechnol<Col N="233" /> ogy, the executive board, requests the director general to support member states in providing the scientific basis for health-related decisions regarding genetically modified foods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first Joint WHO-FAO Consultation on Strategies for Assessing the Safety of Foods Produced by Biotechnology was held in 1990. A further workshop on the principles of substantial equivalence to the safety evaluation of foods or food components from plants derived by modern biotechnology was held in Copenhagen in November 1994. The outcome of these activities constituted a basis for the development of guidelines for the evaluation of foods produced by biotechnology by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. To this end, a Joint FAO-WHO consultation on biotechnology and food safety was convened in Rome in September 1996. This consultation made recommendations on substantial equivalence, allergenicity, gene transfer from genetically modified plants, food organisms expressing pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals, databases, method development and developing countries. An elaboration of these recommendations is available on the FAO's website at <i>www.fao.org.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In resolution WHA 16.42 &ndash; May 1963 &ndash; the Sixteenth World Health Assembly approved the establishment of the joint FAO-WHO food standards programme, with the joint FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission as its principal organ. The commission has subsequently elaborated many international standards on food safety. As the international agency dealing with health, WHO bears the main responsibility for the health and safety aspects of Codex Alimentarius activities so that the health of consumers is appropriately protected. The current working relationship between WHO and FAO under the joint FAO-WHO food standards programme is currently being reviewed with a view to increasing WHO's scientific and public health role in the work of the Codex Alimentarius. WHO has stated that it will continue, in close collaboration with the World Trade Organisation &ndash; WTO &ndash; to advocate that member states fulfil their obligations to take health considerations into account in the globalisation of trade.</P>
    <P>The Codex Alimentarius has recently established a task force on foods derived from biotechnology. The objectives of this task force are to elaborate standards, guidelines or other principles as appropriate for foods derived from biotechnology or traits introduced into foods by biotechnology, on the basis of scientific evidence, risk analysis and having regard, where appropriate, to other legitimate factors relevant to the health of consumers and the promotion of fair trade practices. The task force is due to complete its work within four years. A preliminary report is due to be submitted to the Codex Commission in 2001, a mid-term report in 2002 and a full report in 2003. The first meeting of the task force took place in Chiba, Japan from 14 to 17 March, 2000. At this meeting the task force decided that it would proceed with the elaboration of two <Col N="234" /> major texts, namely: a set of broad general principles for risk analysis of foods derived from biotechnology, and specific guidance on the risk assessment of foods derived from biotechnology.</P>
    <P>An FAO-WHO expert consultation on biotechnology is due to take place in Geneva in June 2000. The current scope of the consultation is to review the current methodology on safety assessment, including the concept of substantial equivalence, and also to study the nutritional aspects of foods derived from biotechnology.</P>

      <P>There are three main pieces of legislation for which my Department is responsible. These are outlined as follows:</P>
      <P>1.Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on 15 May 1997. This regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, including genetically modified food, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved or authorised before being placed on the European market. It also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and novel food ingredients.</P>
      <P>Foods and food ingredients which fall within the scope of this regulation are those which have not as of 15 May, 1997 been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which fall into the following categories:&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)foods which contain genetically modified organisms &ndash; GMOs;</P>
      <P>(b)foods which are produced from but do not contain GMOs;</P>
      <P>(c)food and food ingredients with an intentionally modified molecular structure;</P>
      <P>(d)foods composed of micro-organisms, fungi or algae;</P>
      <P>(e)foods produced from plants or animals not using traditional propagation techniques; and</P>
      <P>(f)foods which are produced from new technologies which give rise to significant changes in the composition or structure of the food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Labelling Provisions</i>The regulation states that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property, e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food, which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be <Col N="235" /> specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of:</P>
    <P>&ndash;material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population, e.g. a protein from a known food allergen source such as peanuts;</P>
    <P>&ndash;material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns, e.g. a gene of porcine origin in a plant; or</P>
    <P>&ndash;an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, e.g. a genetically engineered tomato.</P>
    <P>2.Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The labelling and other provisions of the Novel Foods Regulation as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the EU before the entry into force of the Regulation and, therefore, not considered to be novel. Regulation 1139/98 applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in part, from:</P>
    <P>(a) a genetically modified soya bean, manufactured by Monsanto</P>
    <P>(b) a genetically modified maize, manufactured by Novartis.</P>
    <P>These products were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This Directive is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Labelling</i>This regulation lays down additional labelling requirements for the products outlined above. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
    <P>If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified soya&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced from genetically modified maize&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>
    <P>Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000 amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indica<Col N="236" /> tion on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
    <P>This regulation sets a <i>de minimis</i> threshold level for adventitious contamination at 1% (of each ingredient individually considered). It came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The rationale for such a threshold is to avoid a situation whereby foods and food ingredients would have to be labelled in cases in which, despite not being from GMO origin, small proportions of modified DNA or protein would be present due to &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; contamination of conventional soya or maize with GM soya or maize. Adventitious contamination can potentially occur at many stages of the production chain, from the field &ndash; pollen &ndash; through transport and storage to food processing.</P>
    <P>At a level below this 1%, products not of GMO origin but containing small proportions of genetically modified DNA or protein due to adventitious contamination, will not be subject to the additional labelling requirements as outlined above.</P>
    <P>3.Commission Regulation (EC) No 50/2000 of 10 January 2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
    <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97, the Novel Foods Regulation, or Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 do not apply to additives and flavourings intended to be used in foodstuffs. The Commission, in consultation with member states, agreed that it was important that consumers should be informed of the use of additives or flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced through genetic engineering as they are already informed of the presence of other ingredients containing or produced from genetically modified organisms. Discussions culminated in Regulation 50/2000/EC which came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Labelling Provisions</i>If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a food additive or flavouring, then that food additive or flavouring is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified ..&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>

      <P>In June 1998 I made a policy directive and regulations under the Planning Acts to limit the size of supermarket development to 3,000 square metres, pending the carrying out of a detailed study of retail development and the issue of planning guidelines by my Department. In April 1999 my Department published draft retail planning guidelines for public consultation. The draft guidelines recommended that, pending the preparation and adoption of development plan policies by local authorities, the floorspace cap of 3,000 square metres, which was introduced on supermarket development, should be retained in the rest of the State outside Dublin. Within the greater Dublin area, it recommended that the floorspace cap be increased to 3,500 square metres. When publishing the draft guidelines, the carrying out of a further study of the economic effect of the implementation of the guidelines was announced. This study commenced in early January and is close to completion. The results of this study will be considered with the submissions received on the draft guidelines in finalising the retail planning guidelines which I expect to issue by mid-year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that St. Alphonsus Chapel was recently placed for sale on the Irish market. Officials from my Department met representatives of the developer and were informed of the proposed advertisement. The stated aim of the developers is to find a buyer who will have a use for the building which will not adversely affect its architectural integrity. A similar offer for sale was made, without success, on the international market last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Monastery Chapel of St. Alphonsus is a <Col N="243" /> building of considerable architectural significance, having been designed by George Ashlin, the noted Victorian ecclesiastical architect, in 1872 for the enclosed Redemptorist order of nuns. It was rated as a list one building in the 1999 Dublin city development plan. As such, it automatically became a protected structure on 1 January of this year, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded under the new Act, covers both the interior and exterior of the building. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observation.</P>
    <P>The strength of protection provided by the Act will, I believe, safeguard the special qualities that have led to the inclusion of St. Alphonsus Chapel in the record of protected structures. The acquisition of the chapel by the State may not be necessary although the developers have undertaken to continue discussions with my officials about possible State involvement in the future management of the building. I will be meeting a delegation representative of local interests tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that BirdWatch Ireland is shortly to publish a list of Irish birds of conservation concern. While <Col N="244" /> Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, has not been involved directly in the compilation it has commented on an earlier draft. On receipt of a final list it will be in a position to comment on and analyse this.</P>
      <P>The list covers all of Ireland and its purpose is to update the Irish red data list for birds and to highlight current priorities. It is divided into a red and an amber list, the former containing the species of highest conservation priority. While the red-listed species are not all necessarily in immediate danger of extinction in this country, all have suffered a 50% decline in numbers or in breeding range over the last 25 years, have had a 75% decline in breeding range during the twentieth century, or are classified as globally threatened.</P>
      <P>The red list contains the following 18 species: black-necked grebe, common scoter*, hen harrier, red grouse, grey partridge, quail, corncrake, lapwing*, curlew*, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern*, barn owl, nightjar, ring ouzel, chough*, twite, yellowhammer* and corn bunting. Asterisked species are red-listed in N.I. only, and are amber-listed in the Republic. The twite is the only species red-listed in the Republic and not in N.I.</P>
      <P>There are a number of measures already in place to protect endangered birds. All birds are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Designation of special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; and special protection areas &ndash; SPAs &ndash; under the EU birds and habitats directives further strengthens the protection of all birds endangered and otherwise. While engaging in the general monitoring of bird populations Dúchas has in recent years initiated, collaborated in or funded research, survey or conservation programmes on common scoter, hen harrier, grey partridge, corncrake, lapwing, curlew, roseate tern, chough and, through the countryside bird survey, yellowhammer. The grey partridge, corncrake and roseate tern have also been the subjects of dedicated conservation programmes for a number of years. I understand that BirdWatch Ireland have instigated management programmes or surveys of red-necked phalarope and barn owl.</P>
      <P>Dúchas incorporates material on endangered birds into its ongoing educational programmes dealing with overall species and habitats conservation. It works in close partnership with relevant NGOs, including BirdWatch Ireland, on many of these issues and currently liases with farming organisations and with landowners through the rural environmental protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; and management consultative committees for SACs and SPAs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Discovery Programme Limited is an archaeological research body that is funded by the Heritage Council from its allocation of funds from my Department's Vote. The role of the discovery programme is through archaeological and related research, to work towards a coherent and comprehensive picture of human life in Ireland from earliest times; and to publish the results of this research scientifically and in ways that can be appreciated by the general public.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1999 the discovery programme continued work on four of its original long-term research projects: the north Munster project; the Ballyhoura Hills project; the western stone forts project and the Tara literary project. I understand that these projects are due for completion at the end of 2000. In addition, two new projects were commenced: the medieval rural settlement project in May and the lake settlement project in November. Work was also progressed on a research strategy document due for completion within the next month that will outline recommendations for a second phase of research relating to Tara.</P>
      <P>The discovery programme also continued its pioneering use of new technologies in the field of archaeological research and, through the use of geophysical surveying, a previously unknown and significant new enclosure possibly dating to the late neolithic period was discovered on the Hill of Tara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two discovery programme publications appeared during 1999: discovery programme reports 5; and Mooghaun, a guide booklet about the important hillfort near Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, which had been excavated between 1992 and 1995 as part of the north Munster project. Information panels exploiting this recent research were also prepared by the North Munster project team for erection by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, along an archaeological trail opened at Mooghaun last September. Similarly, members of the western stone forts project team prepared the information panels reflecting their most recent research for <Col N="247" /> the new visitor centre at Dún Aonghasa on Inis Mór. A discovery programme team had excavated this site between 1992 and 1995, as well as the nearby monument at Dún Eoghanachta.</P>
    <P>Three other research monographs were brought to near publication stage. These were a study of the Bronze Age artefacts of the north Munster area; a pioneering and highly productive study of the inter-tidal zone of the Shannon Estuary; and an investigation of the destructive excavations, a century ago, by the British-Israelites at Tara in pursuit of the &lsquo;ark of the covenant'. In addition, discovery programme staff published papers relating to their work in a wide range of academic and popular publications, as well as lecturing at conferences in Ireland and abroad, and to local societies and student groups.</P>
    <P>A travelling exhibition illustrating the work of the discovery programme was displayed in Belfast, Derry, Baile an Fheirtéaraigh and Limerick. As a result of its display in the latter city, a joint educational project was devised with the Hunt Museum that will involve both adults and children, and will draw attention to the research activities of the discovery programme, and, in particular, to the sizeable amount of important research which it has conducted in the mid-west region.</P>

No objections were made <Col N="248" /> and a felling licnece for a number of spruce and pine trees was issued by the Forestry Service. I would point out that the destruction of woodland not included in a felling licence is primarily the responsibility of the Forestry Service of the Department of Marine and Natural Resources and not Dúchas. It is a matter for the Forestry Service to take action where the terms of a felling licence have been reportedly exceeded.</P>
      <P>Following reports received of the destruction of a number of trees falling outside the scope of the felling licence some of which may have contained herons nests, advice is being sought by Dúchas regarding whether a breach of the Wildlife Act, 1976, occurred or not, and the appropriate action to be taken.</P>

      <P>The number of planning applications received by Dúchas, The heritage service of my Department in 1999 and in 2000, to date, was 7,700 and 2,210 respectively. You will appreciate that the number currently not dealt with varies continually from day to day but a reasonable estimate of those currently outstanding is 750-800. Average response time can vary from day of receipt, dealt with by a telephone call to six weeks or so.</P>
      <P>The number of planning applications received by Dúchas in the four preceding years were 2,700, 3,100, 4,500 and 6,100 respectively and represent a near three-fold increase between 1995 and 1999. The increase is as a result of the growth in the economy over the same period as well as an increased awareness of heritage matters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As can be seen from the figures the volume of consultations has grown considerably. It is not possible to offer a detailed level of advice in all cases. In cases where Dúchas have no objections they advise the planning authorities only when requested to do so. The regulations impose a rigid time-frame on planning authorities for giving a decision. As planning authorities are statutorily obliged to make a decision by a certain date, the submission of an assessment, where warranted, <Col N="250" /> by my Department cannot be regarded as in any way material in any perceived delay in the handling and processing of some planning applications.</P>
    <P>I believe that the advice offered by Dúchas is professional and it has helped save aspects of our heritage from damage through inappropriate development. Generally there are sufficient staff to deal with planning applications in an efficient and effective manner although I propose providing additional resources for archaeology in this area.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 260 of 1 February 2000 in relation to Maynooth Castle. The estimated cost of the first phase is £1.3 million and the sum of £124,000 has been spent on the project to date. The remaining phase of the restoration will have to be considered in light of the resources available to my Department and it is not possible at this stage to give an order of costs for this final phase.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a contract has recently commenced for Phase IV of restoration works to Castletown House and involves the repair and re-roofing of the east and west colonnades, the relaying of steps at the entrance and repairs to the ha-ha walls to the rear of the house. To date the total restoration cost, including the current phase, is £6.2 million.</P>
      <P>A considerable programme of works still remains to be done e.g. interior restoration in the house, the upgrading and provision of visitor facilities both in the house and in the demesne generally and improving access. These works will require substantial exchequer funding and will be carried out on a phased basis as resources permit over a number of years. As of now, no firm estimates of cost are available for these further works, however the total cost is likely to run into several million pounds.</P>

      <P>The condition of the Connolly Folly has been closely monitored by my Department since the folly came into State care in 1993.</P>
      <P>The folly was extensively restored by the Irish Georgian Society in the 1960s. The work was to a very high standard and has ensured the generally good condition of the Folly up to the present day.</P>
      <P>A report on the history and condition of the folly was commissioned by my Department in 1998 and following on from this a more detailed report and proposals for works are currently being worked on. Of course, any works to the folly will require planning permission and would only be undertaken in consultation with the Castletown Foundation, the Heritage Council and other interested bodies.</P>
      <P>However, as already stated on a number of occasions in response to previous questions on this issue my Department's priority for the present must be the restoration programme for Castletown House itself.  I can assure the Deputy that the Connolly Folly is not being neglected and restoration works will be undertaken as resources permit.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, was enacted in July 1999. An inter-departmental implementation group, comprising those Departments concerned with the operation of the Act, has been established to oversee its implementation. This group has reported on the necessary steps to bring the Act into operation. In January last, the setting up of a designate national qualifications Authority of Ireland was announced and Mr. Richard Langford was appointed as chairperson.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> The new authority is being set up on an interim basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis. The task of the designate authority will be to commence work on the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and to advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as provided for in the Act. The process of securing nominations to the designate authority, as set out in the Act, is under way. The inaugural meeting of the designate authority is due to take place in the near future.</P>
    <P>The process of securing interim accommodation and staff for the designate authority is also in hand.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of section 29(8) of the Act enable the Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the independent review group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, of Waterford Institute of Technology. When the relevant sections of the Act are brought into operation it is intended that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland will be directed under the terms of this section, to implement the recommendations of the report of the review group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority equality unit published a report Who Cares in the Campus? on childcare provision in higher education institutions in Ireland in November 1999. The Report found that of the 40 institutions that responded to the 1998 All-Ireland survey, no Institute of Technology provided on-campus child care facilities. This compared with nine on-campus child care facilities in the university sector.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority equality unit concluded that the availability of quality, reliable and affordable child care is a key equality issue. It recommends the provision of child care facilities and-or child care grants to facilitate student parents participation in higher education and to facilitate equality of opportunity among staff members. The report noted that there were indications that the provision of child care is becoming a more activated issue in some sectors of higher education, with two of the universities having plans to build crèche facilities and the issue of child care provision being under consideration in a number of institutes of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority also addressed the question of child care provision in its guidelines for the development of student support services, which it provided to third level institutions in 1998. These Guidelines recommend the provision of crèche facilities on site and, where this is not possible, the provision of <Col N="257" /> financial support for students who have to seek child-minding facilities off campus.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of providing child care facilities in third level colleges is primarily a matter for the individual third level colleges. The report referred to earlier identifies the different levels of provision currently being made and identifies a number of issues for consideration by the colleges. Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware of the Government's plan to invest over £250 million within the national development plan on the development of a national child care infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In relation to steps being taken by my Department, my Department's guidelines on the ESF aided student assistance-access fund for third level institutions refers to the possibility of assisting students with family responsibilities, particularly in relation to child care costs, who face significant financial difficulties. As the Deputy may be aware, this fund amounted to £1.296 million in 1999 and represents a significant increase on previous provisions.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce a differential grant maintenance scheme for third level students who live in the Dublin area and have to suffer higher accommodation and living costs associated with Dublin; his views on the additional pressures on these students in terms of finding work to pay for basic commodities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that students are experiencing difficulties in finding good affordable accommodation. This difficulty is a subset of the general housing shortage which has been growing in recent years and is particularly acute in Dublin. In recognition of these difficulties and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the programme for prosperity and fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and as such represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant <Col N="258" /> levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the value of third level maintenance grants, I have previously indicated my intention to follow the practice of recent years and increase the grants in line with inflation, so as to ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained.</P>

      <P>The report and recommendations of the expert advisory group on certificate examinations in relation to the arrangements for the assessment of candidates with special needs in certificate examinations was published recently.</P>
      <P>The advisory group identified a set of principles as a basis for dealing with this complex and difficult area. My Department has begun the process of implementing the recommendations and applying the principles to applications on hand for this year's examinations including those for students with specific learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>The full text of the report and a circular setting out revised arrangements that will come into effect immediately have been circulated to schools and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to have the Deputy provided with copies of these documents.</P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage within the primary system.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre has recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including schools in County Monaghan. Responses from schools will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
      <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The report in question has been published and I have arranged for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the demands for increased funding by voluntary secondary schools. Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. The standard per capita grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of voluntary secondary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>
