      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste refer to the legislation promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to amend our corruption laws, the most recent of which was enacted in 1916, to shift the onus of proof in the case of anyone receiving money in a public capacity who makes a decision that could be of benefit to the donor to require them to prove their was not a corrupt motive and in light of recent revelations will she agree to take the Fine Gael Bill in Government time? In regard to what has happened overnight will she accept that Fine Gael would support the taking of the Labour Party Bill, the Registration of Lobbyists Bill in Government time? These two measures taken together would represent a comprehensive package. Obviously the Government can, on Committee Stage, amend any of these measures if it considers it necessary. The House should be seen to act today on these two issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Government has had time to reflect overnight on the stated opposition yesterday by the Taoiseach. I respectfully suggest he was misinformed in not having fully read the Labour Party Bill which provides for definitions in relation to lobbyists. In light of the widespread concern which affects everybody in the House, I ask that Second Stage of the Labour Party Bill be taken in Government time and amended accordingly at the earliest possible opportunity and also that the issues referred to by Deputy Bruton regarding the updating of our corruption legislation be addressed. This is not a reflection on the Government <i>per se</i>, it is quite manifest from the schedule of legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the burden of legislative drafting in that <Col N="1039" /> Department is enormous. The capacity of other parties to draft legislation can be utilised on Second Stage. I urge the Leader of the Progressive Democrats and the Tánaiste, whose party, I understand, is in favour of the lobby register, as are some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, to reconsider the misled and ill-informed position adopted by the Taoiseach yesterday and to accept our Bill on Second Stage in Government time and to proceed to amend it accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Tánaiste to give priority to the Registration of Lobbyists Bill and also to the standards in public office Bill. The latter is promised, but not yet. I ask that the Planning Act, 1963, be looked at so that badly made and corruptly made rezoning decisions can be reversed where possible.</P>

      <P>The Government and I share the concern that has been expressed at the recent revelations at the Flood tribunal. This House established the tribunal and has always supported it. A couple of weeks ago speakers on all sides of the House were very critical of those who sought to criticise the tribunal.

      <P>The prevention of corruption legislation will be discussed at the end of May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the legislation be ready? We need legislation which shifts the onus of proof onto a recipient of money who takes a decision in a public capacity which benefits the donor. Such people should be required to prove there was no corruption. Fine Gael has already drafted a simple piece of legislation to do this and the Government has had it since last March. This legislation is being tabled again this morning. Will the Tánaiste agree to take the two Bills &ndash; the Labour Party Bill on the registration of lobbyists which most of the House will support, and the Fine Gael Bill, which I have no doubt the Fianna Fáil Party will also support in its thrust if not in every aspect of its detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The prevention of corruption legislation was published in January and will be discussed in May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation is to ratify an EU convention. It is a different thing entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The legislation which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to publish is the fraud offences legislation. That will be published in the middle of May. While legislation is necessary to ensure that we have effective laws, it would be wrong to <Col N="1041" /> assume that the lack of legislation caused what has happened. Legislation will not make dishonest people honest. We should be clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary. If the burden of proof is shifted&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a discussion on this matter. We must have questions and answers on proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Quinn's suggestion regarding lobbyists, the Taoiseach said yesterday that the matter should go to a committee of the House. The Labour Party Bill will be before that committee and it is intended that the Government will also put proposals to the committee which I hope will meet very soon after Easter. It may well be that the Labour Party Bill will be amended by the committee or that a different Bill will emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree to give Government time to consider the Fine Gael Bill on corruption which updates the 1889 and 1916 Acts concerning corrupt payments? This has nothing to do with fraud. It deals with corruption which is a different thing. The Bill is concerned with the corruption of the exercise of a public office. That is what was at stake in the tribunal yesterday. The Fine Gael Bill proposes to change the onus of proof to require a donor to prove that there was no corrupting motive in the receipt of a donation or payment. Will the Tánaiste agree to deal with this Bill in Government time? This Bill is separate from and complementary to the Labour Party Bill. The matter is not dealt with in the Labour Party Bill. This is not a criticism of the Labour Party Bill which deals with a different issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what we have heard in the past 24 hours, I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats cannot accept on Second Stage, a Bill which is already in printed form. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a workload which will prevent the Department preparing a Bill. It is already incapable of meeting its own self-imposed timetable. What will be said to the public who will listen to Fianna Fáil backbenchers saying they are awaiting a document in the future when a document has already been tabled? A precedent was established by the previous Government, and has been followed by the present Government, of accepting Opposition legislation. Deputy O'Sullivan's legislation on equality issues has been accepted, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste may not be able to say so now because the Taoiseach is not here but the Taoiseach was clearly misinformed yesterday. He had not read the Bill. I do not expect that he would have done so. However, he has now read it and I have spoken to him about it. There is ample <Col N="1042" /> precedent for the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Parties, members of which are in favour of a register of lobbyists, accepting the Labour Party Bill. This will not solve all the problems but it will prevent new ones from occurring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Mr. Justice Flood did with Mr. Dunlop, I urge the Government to reflect, to accept this Bill on Second Stage and then amend it in the appropriate select committee. The alternative path proposed by the Government will mean that it will be September before legislative proposals emerge.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to amend section 18 to make provision for management plans for natural heritage areas as presented in natural heritage orders. Part of the natural heritage area order should include the need for a management plan.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of issues relating to section 19. Neither the Minister nor local authorities should be exempt from requiring permission to carry out developments which affect natural heritage areas. Everybody should have to seek and obtain permission for works to be carried out in NHAs. Sites should be fully protected between notification and designation. Any damage done to a natural heritage area during this period should constitute an offence.</P>
      <P>It should not be possible to obtain permission by default to carry out works in NHAs. This arises in the context of section 19(1)(<i>b</i>). Section 19(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> Where there is a subsisting natural heritage area order in respect of any land, no person shall carry out, or cause or permit to be carried out, on that land any works specified in the order or any works which are liable to destroy or to significantly alter, damage or interfere with the features by reason of which the designation order was made unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>6 months have expired from the date of the notice under <i>paragraph (a)</i> and the Minister has not refused consent in writing to the works being carried out.</P>
    <P>This type of provision is unusual and unsatisfactory. It should not be beyond the capabilities of the State to send either written refusal or consent within six months. I ask the Minister to examine that because the Department could make a decision to refuse permission but, through an error or oversight, fail to respond within six months. Surely it is possible for the Department to set up a system which ensures that responses are given to such matters.</P>
    <P>Section 23 deals with the registration of a natural heritage area order as a burden on the land. It states:</P>
    <P>A natural heritage area order and any amendment or revocation thereof may be registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1964 (as amended by <i>section 74</i>), in the appropriate register maintained under that Act, as a burden on the land.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is mystifying. I suggest the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted as there is no logical reason for the insertion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which suggests that the legislation does not make it clear that there is a burden on the land if an NHA designation exists.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Wildlife Act, 1976, an environmental impact statement is necessary when arterial drainage schemes are being carried out by the Office of Public Works. I am concerned that work on maintaining existing drainage schemes have caused damage. It should be a requirement for the Office of Public Works to consult with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands prior to undertaking any maintenance work on existing schemes, particularly in NHAs or proposed NHAs. I ask the Minister to sympathetically consider this issue between now and Committee Stage and I look forward to her response.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me about the provision of an independent appeals board which should be included in the Bill. It has been suggested that an organisation replicating An Bord Pleanála, such as an bord dúchas, should be established. This organisation would have responsibility for determining appeals on site designation. There must be transparency and accountability and everything should be judged on its merits so allegations cannot be made about untoward actions or political interference. The <Col N="1052" /> Minister proposes to alter section 51 which imposes new controls which were not intended.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill and I look forward to working constructively with her on Committee Stage to ensure this legislation is as comprehensive as possible. I hope she has an opportunity between now and Committee Stage to consider the points I made about consolidation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Its main features are to provide a mechanism to give statutory protection to natural heritage areas; to make use of that mechanism to provide statutory protection for important geological and geomorphological sites, including fossil sites; to improve some existing measures and introduce new ones to enhance the conservation of wildlife species and their habitats, for example, the protection of bat roosts, refuges and flora and a ban on hunting; to enhance a number of existing controls in respect of hunting which are designed to serve the interests of the wildlife conservation programme; to introduce new provisions to regulate the business of commercial shoot operators; to increase substantially the level of fines for contravention of the Wildlife Acts and to allow for the imposition of prison sentences; to provide a mechanism to allow the Minister to act independently of forestry legislation, for example, in relation to the acquisition of land by agreement; to strengthen the provisions relating to the cutting of hedgerows during the critical bird nesting period and to include a requirement that hedgerows may be cut only during that period by public bodies, including local authorities, for reasons of public health or safety; to strengthen the protective regime for special areas of conservation by removing any doubt that protection will in all cases apply from the time of notification of the proposed sites; and to give specific statutory recognition in light of Ireland's commitments to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity to the Minister's responsibilities in regard to promoting the conservation of biological diversity, which is now a key concept in the area of global ecology.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the features of geological and geomorphological interest which the Minister highlighted during her speech. Up to now there has been no specific provision for the protection of areas or features of geological or geomorphological interest. Geological refers to the physical and biological history of the earth and geomorphological refers to the configuration of the earth's surface and landforms such as cliffs, caves, eskers and drumlins. There are many eskers and drumlins throughout Laois which are in important feature of the landscape and I am please that, for the first time, this issue is being dealt with in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> These elements are an important part of our natural environment and fossil records in particular are an invaluable source of information about the very distant past. We have all learned with great interest about the fossilised footprints found at Valentia, County Kerry, which are considered to be of worldwide importance. Perhaps as long as 400 million years ago this creature left its footprints in a shallow tropical stream and the fossilised records of this event are one of the threads from which scientists are trying to weave a fuller picture of the planet's past. Our prime geological and geomorphological sites, including fossilised records, are extremely important and are worth protecting.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 and 51 have attracted particular public attention and Members for Laoighis-Offaly have received many representations concerning their provisions. As a result of correspondence and dialogue between the Minister and myself and other Deputies, and consultations between departmental officials and interested parties prior to and following the publication of the Bill, it is now clear that sections 46 and 51, as published, would impose new controls on existing legal forms of hunting which were never intended. In the context of section 46, the Minister now proposes to apply the ban on the use of lamps and similar devices to protected species only. She also proposes to delete the provision in section 51 which would have made it an offence to hunt with a dog, ferret or bird of prey, or to have control of a pack of hounds on lands without the owner's consent. I am pleased that this is now on public record and the Minister wrote to me in this regard earlier this month. These changes will satisfy a number of people in my constituency who had understandable reservations about these provisions when first published.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues of particular interest to me which are dealt with in the Bill. I am chairman of Castletown, County Laois, Tidy Towns committee which was the county winner in the national Tidy Towns competition. Last year the town was fourth overall in the national competition and was a national category winner for villages of its size. Over the past four years I have been pleased to note that a major element of marks awarded in the national Tidy Towns competition now deal with wildlife and natural amenities. In the past, these competitions were geared, primarily, towards tourism but now place greater emphasis on natural amenities. This area has not been sufficiently addressed by Tidy Towns committees in the past and we all need to work on it if improvements are to take place. However, caution should be taken when cutting roadside hedges during the summer months. The Bill highlights some difficulties in this respect but there should be a balance between the nesting season and making the countryside an attractive place for people to live in and visit.</P>
    <P>Work is about to commence on a major development of the N7 and N8 through County Laois which will have a major ecological impact. <Col N="1054" /> It is proposed to designate a number of areas as national heritage areas and these matters have been fully taken into account by the NRA at the first stage of planning the route corridors. I implore all involved in such major projects to learn the lessons of the famous snail on the Kildare by-pass. Those who took this case to the European court have done Ireland a service by ensuring that these matters are properly considered at the planning stage of such major infrastructural projects. Sadly this has not been the position in the past. A lesson has been learned and people will have to take these matters into account at the early stages of future developments.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, European funding is conditional on ensuring that we fully implement the wildlife and habitats directives. This is important. Some regard such a measure as a nuisance and gross interference but it is a forward looking measure. The construction of roads may be a priority and this work needs to be done and has my support. However, such work must take account of wildlife and environmental impact assessments.</P>
    <P>My eyes were opened as regards wildlife and geology when I was 12 years of age and I had the privilege of being taken on a field trip on the Castlecomer plateau near Crettyard, south County Laois, by Professor John Feehan, now of the department of environmental resource management, UCD. At that time he was studying for his H.Dip. Professor Feehan brought a group of young people to this area and showed us what I thought was just a piece of shale. However, he highlighted the fossilised marks of a tree which had rotted possibly thousands of years ago. He knew that, through scientific research, he would be able to tell us how long the tree had been there, for how long it grew and where and in what period it fell. This trip was an extraordinary eye opener as I could not believe it was possible to ascertain such vital information from a casual walk up the side of a mountain and along a riverbank. This was possible because Professor Feehan had the knowledge to understand what he was talking about and he shared that knowledge with us.</P>
    <P>Professor Feehan wrote a famous book entitled <i>Laois &ndash; An Environmental History</i> which has been well reported. He was also involved in a more recent publication called <i>The Great Heath</i>. This publication deals with the heath in County Laois through time and tells us that the origins of the earth go back 4,600 million years and that the formation of limestones began in the oceans during the lower carboniferous period. It also points out that limestones were sculpted into the landscape during the tertiary era which led to the formation of features such as the Rock of Dunamase. These features are referred to in the Bill as geomorphological aspects of the earth's surface and the Rock of Dunamase is one of the classic examples of such an aspect.</P>
    <P>The publication then covers the impact the ice age had on the landscape and points out that the <Col N="1055" /> first people came to live in what is now the heath in County Laois only 9,600 years ago. This highlights that man has been on this planet for a short time and this should be considered whenever we debate wildlife. The Minister should lend her support to and ask the Office of Public Works to co-operate fully with the management plan for the heath identified in Portlaoise and to work with the local golf club and farmers involved.</P>
    <P>When preparing for this debate I thought of consulting older people about the importance of this issue. However, I also decided to consult my nine year old son because we should look to the future. He showed me a CD-ROM entitled <i>Bellamy's Endangered Wildlife</i> which showed moving images of animals from all over the world, including sound. He could have come into the House and given Members a lecture on this subject even though he is only nine years of age. This is an example of what is happening in our schools and what technology, education and science can achieve.</P>
    <P>We will get this legislation right if we adhere to one simple philosophy &ndash; we did not inherit this earth from our forefathers, rather we have borrowed it from our children. If we bear this in mind we will look to the future and preserve the earth for future generations and millennia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague for allowing me share his very valuable time. His contribution was extremely well thought out. I apologise if I have interfered in any way with his right to speak in the House.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to have the opportunity &ndash; which I would not have had if I were still a Minister &ndash; to speak on this Bill. I praise the Minister, Deputy de Valera, who is an excellent colleague. I do not think I am breaching Cabinet confidentiality by saying we had a particularly good relationship in Cabinet, where her contributions were always supportive of colleagues. I also do not think it is a breach of Cabinet confidentiality to say I supported the Minister very strongly on this legislation. It is an enormous achievement by her to bring so much legislation before the House. As she very wisely pointed out at the beginning of Second Stage, it has taken 15 years to get us to this point.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking on the Bill, apart from the fact that I am a hill walker and a fly fishermen &ndash;  those two elements are very strongly dealt with in the Bill &ndash; is that I made a strong intervention at Cabinet, as I do now, in relation to section 47 which, as Deputy Fleming said, deals with hedgerows. The Minister has introduced legislation to bring back the cutting of hedgerows from 15 April to 1 April, which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said, we need a balance. My appreciation of the contribution made by the farming community to this country over the years is second to none. They have had a terrible series of ups and downs in their professional lives. It is <Col N="1056" /> a cyclical way of life. I have great regard for them. I often travel the Galway-Dublin road, where I see the cutting back of hedges. I have never seen any transgressions, as such. However, I am a keen gardener and it is a well known fact that if one cuts a hedge often and regularly one will destroy it. The more often one cuts a hedge tightly, the weaker the hedge becomes. There are hedges on the Galway-Dublin road which one can see through and which have large gaps. That is the tragedy which occurs due to the constant tight cutting of hedges and hedgerows.</P>
    <P>That defeats what the Minister is, quite properly, seeking to achieve, which is a balance between the right to have a neat and tidy countryside and the need to allow our wildlife survive in decent and proper circumstances. I thank the Minister for trying to achieve that balance. I do not make that observation by way of criticism. I would like to think it is a helpful observation in the interests of conservation of wildlife.</P>
    <P>I come from a coastal constituency which I have represented for many years. I welcome anything which will achieve clean water in Dublin Bay &ndash; which the Bill sets out in considerable detail &ndash; and, hopefully, the final closure of Sellafield, which does harm to the Irish Sea and further afield.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill is long overdue. It has been in gestation for 15 years. There is a new system of natural heritage areas, including geological sites. There is stronger protection of special areas of conservation by the Minister's very proper amending of the definition. I particularly appreciate that the legislation has a broader scope and now includes fish and better protection for wild animals and birds and their habitats, which I dealt with in my remarks about hedgerows.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes greater control of hunting for conservation purposes, including the regulation of commercial shoot operators. Some of our visitors from abroad &ndash; I will not mention the countries &ndash; would shoot everything that flies, which is tragic. Blackbirds, robins and so on have been the victims of the desire to kill anything that flies. The Minister has, to a great extent, brought that under control in this and other legislation. When the majority of our citizens see that happening, they act as guardians of the environment and try to prevent it as best they can. However, they cannot intervene if they are not there to witness what is happening.</P>
    <P>Tougher penalties, including prison sentences, will be allied to greater powers of enforcement. There are also provisions in the Bill to allow for ratification of the various conventions relating to heritage and wildlife.</P>
    <P>There are very interesting statistics on the coastal zone. The diversity and dynamism of the coastal zone has already been noted, as has been the importance of the zone and the resources it contains for most maritime countries. We are a maritime country and an island nation. This is reflected in the heavy concentration of popu<Col N="1057" /> lation in the coastal zone. For example, two thirds of Norway's 4.5 million population live within 15 kilometres of salt water. The average population density of coastal counties in the United States is five times greater than non-coastal counties. Some 1.81 million of Ireland's population of 3.5 million would be described as living in coastal municipalities. Those are very important figures. For that and many other reasons, the Minister's hard work on the Bill is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In recent years, natural habitats and species have come under increasing pressure. Economic success and development inevitably increase such pressure. Therefore, the additional measures which the Minister has wisely brought in are needed to ensure our natural heritage is protected.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill, which I appreciate, is to achieve a proper balance, whereby conservation and human activities can coexist. Protected areas will not become no-go areas for development, but developments proposed for these areas will have to be carefully assessed in the interests of the community, the nation and what the Bill seeks to achieve. Anything that would cause significant damage will be prevented or modified, but anything that would not can go ahead.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation does not allow this kind of control to be applied. The Wildlife Act, 1976, was a good Act for its time. However, times have moved on. While it provides a generally sound basis for species conservation, it falls short of what we need today for the protection of sites of particular natural importance. It is also generally accepted that today there is a need for stronger and more effective protection of all elements of wildlife. The Bill addresses this matter across a broad front. I thank the Minister for the hard work which it is clear she has put into the Bill and for the manner in which she has received representations from people like me in this House. It is appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other speakers in welcoming the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999. I particularly welcome the decision to provide statutory protection for national heritage areas. That is probably the most important aspect of the Bill. It is essential that there be such statutory provision for these areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome also her decision to improve and introduce new measures to enhance the conservation of wildlife species and their habitats. That is important also.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new licensing system for commercial shoot operators who cater mainly for non-resident hunters. These are the tourist shooters to whom Deputy Andrews referred. Many of these non-resident hunters have scant respect, if any, for basic conservation laws. Deputy Andrews was correct in stating that they shoot blackbirds and other rare species in flight, but I have heard reports that they also shoot them on trees and on the ground. This licensing system for commercial shoot operators will be a great help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The Bill, I am glad to say, recognises the need for applicants for hunting licences to undergo a competency test in knowledge of wildlife and species identification. There are many people who own guns and go out shooting but have a limited knowledge of the birds at which they are shooting. As a result, they shoot many protected species. They should be required to undergo this competency test. There will be a great deal of opposition to this nevertheless it is important. The National Association of Regional Game Councils, which represents about 20,000 club members, already provides safety and proficiency courses. There are about 60,000 licence holders and they should be asked to participate in this course.</P>
    <P>The use of traps, snares, sets, poisons and other devices which are used for hunting wildlife needs to be carefully examined. People are far too callous and careless in setting traps, sets and snares. It is important that the Minister would impose restrictions on some of the methods which are being used. She is correct to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming mentioned section 46. There should not be much dilution of that section which prohibits the use of lamps, mirrors, etc., in hunting. The Deputy may have been confused with the Principal Act, but section 46 is important in that it states that anybody who uses any lamp, light, torch, mirror or other artificial light-reflecting or dazzling device or appliance, or any device for illuminating, image intensifying or heat seeking a target, etc., in hunting any wild bird or wild animal, otherwise than while either attaching thereto any band, ring, tag or other marking device, shall be guilty of an offence. That is an important section. I do not believe the Minister intends watering down that section and I would be against any attempt to do so. Anybody who goes out at night and lamps birds is not a sportsperson. Such persons do not have any regard for wildlife. Anybody who is involved in the sport of shooting would regard that as blackguardly conduct. There may be some misunderstanding there on the part of Deputy Fleming.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look again at section 51, to which Deputy Fleming referred also. There are considerable concerns about this section which amends section 44 of the Principal Act. Many people are concerned that the section would make people, who are involved in hunting, unwittingly guilty of a criminal offence. It also increases the liability of farmers and landowners on whose goodwill people in the hunt depend. Many farmers and landowners are pleased that the hunt provides a valuable service for them. I ask the Minister to conduct a careful review of this matter because the representations which have been made by a number of these people have the support of the IFA, the ICMSA and a number of other organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the overall direction of the policy being pursued by the Minister. The work of her Department overlaps with that of many other <Col N="1059" /> Departments. For example, she has responsibility for the fish in the rivers but she has no responsibility for controlling pollution of the rivers which, to a large extent, would be under the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and local authorities. I want to be blunt. The rivers, lakes and streams are becoming heavily polluted. Last night the House debated a motion on a River Shannon authority and many speakers and a number of the farmers who were in the Public Gallery to whom I spoke were concerned about the pollution of that river. Some of the lakes are heavily polluted also. The Minister does not need me to tell her that fish are unable to survive in these polluted waters and fish stocks are being depleted at an alarming rate. The Minister must do something to address this. On the continent one can see what they have done to clean the rivers in countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where they have managed to bring back fish life to a number of the rivers. We must see what we can do in this area.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about salmon. There is a problem in this regard, however, in that there is a lucrative illegal trade in salmon and the only person who would be able to resolve is not the Minister but the Holy Ghost. That trade has been going on for a long time and one would not know who is involved in it. It is a tricky and dangerous area in which to become involved. Certainly what is going on there is not right.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned that many people are being brought in by tour operators to shoot and fish. In addition there are many people arriving in camper vans. There is little curtailment on the quantities of fish which are being taken out of the rivers and lakes by a number of these people. They put them in the deep freeze in their camper vans and leave Ireland with them when they return home. I do not know whether they sell them or use it themselves when they return home. I have heard widespread complaints from people in areas where fishing is an important sport that many of these people take huge quantities of fish, put them in their deep freezers and return home. This is not acceptable and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, together with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, will have to address it.</P>
    <P>Much of what the Minister is attempting to do can be achieved through REPS. In 1995 the REPS payment was £50 per acre; today the figure is £48 per acre. Perhaps this is because of the fall in the value of the euro, but one would have expected the figure to have increased over the five years. There are no allowances for inflation, etc. in the scheme. This is also relevant to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development,  but nevertheless the Departments will have to co-operate. A further problem is the cost of complying with REPS, which has increased, while the income from it has decreased.</P>
    <P>The last REPS scheme concluded at the end of <Col N="1060" /> December and it is expected a new scheme will be passed in Brussels in June. Implementation will be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I presume the Minister's Department will also have an input. I fear it will be the end of the year before it is up and running.</P>
    <P>The costings used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in assessing farm buildings have not kept pace with inflation in the construction industry. Many farmers, therefore, are unable to afford new farm buildings, and this must be examined. There are approximately 45,000 farmers in REPS and many are leaving the scheme mainly because of the huge amount of bureaucracy, which must be addressed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The early retirement scheme is still causing problems and has become very bureaucratic. The Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, might examine the scheme. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is involved in liaising with the IFA. The bureaucracy of the old scheme, the fact that young farmer transferees were not allowed hold off-farm income and the enlargement clause all posed problems. I have a letter from a colleague solicitor which goes into considerable detail and I will raise this with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at a future date.</P>
    <P>The penalties imposed in the Bill on people who use lamps, mirrors and other dazzling devices for capturing or shooting animals are very important. There is a major problem in terms of a large number of our birds. I am sure the Minister's Department and officials are aware of the rapid decline in farmland birds. I am from the Shannon area and have been in communication with many people about the breeding and wintering birds on the Shannon callows. I refer in particular to the lapwing, which has undergone an alarming decline in recent years. People have told me that the lapwing will be extinct in Ireland in five years unless a major effort is made to ensure the species is preserved. Other birds, such as the corncrake, the skylark, the barn owl and the yellow hammer are also declining in numbers. There was a marginal increase in the number of corncrakes, but there had previously been a huge decrease. Those involved in the area both in terms of a hobby and a profession are afraid that some of these birds will be extinct within five to ten years. The skylark, barn owl and yellow hammer are beautiful birds and the Minister should see what efforts can be made to preserve them.</P>
    <P>The decrease in numbers has occurred because of changes in agriculture, building construction, the works of local authorities, etc. It is important to ascertain how these birds can be preserved. There are a number of schemes in the Shannon valley area which should be improved and expanded to ensure farmers are compensated for complying with regulations which may mean delaying the cutting and harvesting of crops. The <Col N="1061" /> Minister will have the goodwill of the IFA in this matter. Much good work is being done but it is insufficient and we must see how the Bill can be further improved.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act provided many exemptions in terms of agriculture, forestry, road maintenance and building construction. Deputy Andrews spoke about the necessity to maintain hedgerows, which is very important. The continuing clearance of hedgerows will result in the extinction of wildlife. People who have cleared hedgerows are later often sorry for doing so. They can be cleared inside an hour, but it takes years and years to build them up. We should examine what can be done to ensure these vital habits for birds are retained. About two-thirds of our breeding birds require this habitat. We have a long way to go in this regard.</P>
    <P>I understand the amended legislation will require the commitment of adequate resources by the Department in terms of money, manpower, facilities and equipment which will allow for the increased management and enforcement. It is important that Dúchas and the wildlife service, which have been understaffed for many years, are provided with personnel as I believe a number of staff in the Department are currently overstretched.</P>
    <P>Natural heritage areas cover about 7% of the land of Ireland. It is essential that co-operation with farmers is increased or at least continued in this context. Similarly, there must be co-operation with local authorities because as far as I am aware a large section of local authority development will be exempt, which concerns me. We need to examine how national heritage areas can be preserved while so much road building and widening is taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister is engaged in work of great importance. The Esker hills in County Offaly are an important area of natural heritage, as are the natural habitats formed by the bogs. Deputy Fleming mentioned the Heath golf club communicating with the Department. I have a copy of its report; it is a comprehensive document and I will furnish it to the Minister. The club is anxious to co-operate with the Department, the Office of Public Works, local farmers and those in the Heath area to ensure this large tract of land is developed in a planned manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, and I compliment the Minister on introducing it. It is far-sighted legislation which aims to use the mechanisms available to us to protect our environment while moving forward as a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are well aware of the importance of the environment. We have a duty to protect it and to hand it on to future generations in a proper state. The best way to do this is not to treat the environment as something so fragile it belongs in a museum. When we pass it on to future generations we want them to be able to enjoy the natural world, to live alongside it and to be comfortable with it. We do not want it to be something <Col N="1062" /> which can only be observed behind a glass shield or a barrier of prescriptive legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation realises the importance of the natural world and adopts a holistic approach. The natural world is not made up of prescribed lists of plants and animal species but represents an intertwining of all these species. The two most important aspects of the legislation are the establishment of the natural heritage areas and the greater powers it grants to intervene in a balanced manner. The natural heritage areas have been placed on a statutory basis for the first time. Provision has also been included in the Bill for the inclusion of areas of the natural world which are an important aspect of the environment, such as zones of special geological and other interest. Ireland has many areas which could fall within this category.</P>
    <P>In the Cavan-Monaghan constituency the forces of nature covered the landscape with drumlins. For generations farmers have attempted to wring a tenuous livelihood from that landscape. They have been and continue to be the best protectors the landscape could have. For those people that landscape is not an abstraction, not something represented by a diagram in a textbook, but part of the earth from which they are expected to feed themselves and their families. The farming community lives at the cutting edge between mankind and nature and has learned to respect it. The names we use in our postal addresses owe much to the landscape around us. The lives of those in the farming community were intimately governed by the rhythm of the seasons for it was as a result of their pact with nature that they were able to survive. Before the arrival of modern medicine, the natural world provided remedies. We all know that a nettle sting was treated by applying a dock leaf, a practice which has a scientific basis. We must never lose sight of the important role played by inhabitants of rural areas, particularly the farming community, in looking after nature.</P>
    <P>There is much ill informed comment which seeks to brand the farming community as polluters following a selfish, cavalier attitude to the environment. The best that can be said of such commentators is that they show a painful level of ignorance. I do not close my eyes to the reality of pollution but sometimes the best results come from an educational process. Part of our duty in protecting the environment is to identify areas where problems have arisen in the past and where they might arise again and to educate those involved about the risks of pollution and how they can be avoided. If people know the risks and still cause pollution, we must penalise them as this Bill enables us.</P>
    <P>The REP scheme is a valuable mechanism for protecting the environment and it has worked well in many areas. It has been very effective in preventing effluent from farmland flowing into the lakes and watercourses which abound in County Cavan. Part of the reason for the <Col N="1063" /> scheme's success is the involvement of those on the ground.</P>
    <P>This legislation brings us into line with European practice on the hunting, particularly the hunting, of birds. There is no argument for the banning of hunting altogether. After all, selective scientific culling is often resorted to for reasons of protection. We must ensure, however, that those to whom we give hunting licences are credible enthusiasts and participants in the sport. We must also ensure that hunters have a high level of respect for and knowledge of wildlife. In some countries, to apply for a hunting licence a person has to follow a detailed course and pass an examination in advance.</P>
    <P>All Members received correspondence from the Irish Foot Harriers Association about this Bill. Some of those involved in the association in my county are concerned about section 51, which amends section 44 of the 1976 Act. The association indicated that this section would cause problems for a hunter who went over a boundary to land where no permission had been given to hunt and that could be in conflict with the main thrust of the Occupiers' Liability Act. I remember Deputy De Valera and me raising this matter on the Adjournment and tabling Parliamentary Questions about the need to introduce that Act. The Minister took an interest in that legislation because of its importance to County Clare.</P>
    <P>The association also asked me to raise section 38 of the 1976 Act which will be amended by section 46 of the legislation before us at present. The association stated that it would prohibit the lamping of foxes and rabbits and could cause a serious problem for sheep farmers during the lambing season and to crops which could be damaged by rabbits. The association is anxious that the Minister should give further consideration to these sections. The people involved, with whom my constituency colleagues and I spoke, are keen sports enthusiasts. They go out of their way to conserve the environment and work in a positive manner with nature. The case they made is credible and I hope that their reservations and requests will be considered on Committee Stage. Other than that the association is quite happy with the thrust of the legislation and the detailed work that has been put into drafting it.</P>
    <P>Its members raised one other issue. I may not put the argument correctly but I am sure the Minister and her officials will investigate it. It refers to the licensing of hunt hounds and kennels. Apparently, the fee for such a licence was £100 per kennel. A club only needed one licence to cover all the hounds owned by its members. However, the fee was increased to £200 and it is not clear whether each owner can keep his or her hound at his or her residence or whether the hounds must be housed in one kennel. This sport is important in rural areas and if all the hounds must be kept in one kennel, that would have a detrimental effect on clubs and their network. For <Col N="1064" /> example, if in a rural parish a club has 20 or 25 members, it is not feasible to house all the hounds in one kennel.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of members of the Foot Harriers Association and others who hunt are keen sports enthusiasts and are very committed to the preservation and enhancement of nature. They keep hounds purely for sporting purposes. These animals are cared for extremely well by their owners and I hope the Minister and her officials will pursue this query and rectify the anomaly so that an impossible burden will not be placed on individual clubs or participants.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Enright regarding the importance of REPS and the control of farm pollution scheme. It was fortunate that this Government reintroduced a number of on-farm investment schemes, namely, the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes. They are of immense importance in Cavan-Monaghan because of the long winters experienced in the area and the fact that the soil is not free draining because of the number of drumlins there. There is a longer housing season for cattle in this area than elsewhere because of higher rainfall and the fact that the land is not free draining. Cattle cannot be kept on the land as long as in other parts of Ireland. I welcome the control of farm pollution scheme and I am glad that substantial funding has been allocated in the national development plan for on-farm investment measures.</P>
    <P>The farming community, by and large, is keen to protect the environment. Unfortunately, in any industry or organisation there is always a small minority who will not adhere properly to the rules of the game and who will pollute the environment. The farming community and, indeed, farming organisations have worked extremely hard to create awareness about the need to conserve and improve our lakes and waterways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan and myself attended a meeting last Friday night in Ballyjamesduff, organised by the ICMSA as part of an awareness campaign on new draft guidelines and by-laws that Cavan County Council will introduce for the protection of the environment. It was a credit to the ICMSA that such a meeting was organised. Officials from the council and the fisheries board were present to outline the general thinking behind the new draft by-laws. The farming community was given an opportunity to make observations and submissions on the draft guidelines. However, a theme which ran through the meeting was that a partnership is needed between all the statutory authorities, the farming community, individual householders and industrial and commercial concerns. By working together and introducing practical laws and regulations, it can be ensured improvements which are necessary to protect the environment can be achieved and much progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many voluntary organisations involved in angling and tourism development which over the years have played a constructive role in ensuring that we made the most <Col N="1065" /> of our natural resources. Such organisations have played a crucial role in creating awareness about the need to protect the environment in their own localities. Their promotional work and the awareness they created have generated much tourism revenue. That work has continued and has been supplemented by Exchequer investment in the development of inland waterways and fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works did a marvellous job restoring the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal which is now the Erne-Shannon waterway. When that project went to construction there was a requirement that the flora, fauna and fisheries should be protected. It is a great credit to the officials in the waterways section of the Office of Public Works at that time that they did so much good work. They constructed a new waterway which is navigable by the most modern cruisers and ensured that nature was preserved and enhanced. That section is now part of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned over the years about the<i> ad hoc</i> development of forestry. There is a great need to implement a proper planning process for such development. Forests have too often been planted on the edges of lakes and rivers and it is absolutely appalling that this has been allowed to happen. Many of my constituents contacted me when Coillte or private forestry companies bought land near them because trees were planted close to natural waterways and sometimes around individual houses. Planning regulations must be strictly enforced or new ones will have to be drafted to ensure planting cannot take place within a specified distance of private residences or beside waterways.</P>
    <P>When flora and fauna are discussed, people naturally think of the Burren in County Clare as an area of international importance. A townland called Burren is located in the Cuilcagh mountain range outside Blacklion, County Cavan. Unfortunately, in the late 1950s the area was planted by the then State forestry company. In the meantime that timber has been extracted. The local community council have carried out a major geological and archaeological survey. It now transpires that the area has a vast array of flora and fauna, something similar to its namesake in County Clare. It is a tragedy that the area was planted at that time but, thankfully, due to the work of the local community council in Blacklion and our local councillor in that area, Councillor Eddie Feeley, funding was secured to carry out proper research. The first stage of that research has been completed and further studies are being undertaken to try to develop a natural mountain park. It will be a cross-Border project because some of this area runs into County Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to compliment Councillor Feeley and the local community council on their initiative in seeking funding and having a detailed professional study carried out which highlights the importance of that area from a cultural, heritage, archaeological and geological <Col N="1066" /> point of view. I look forward to the further development of that area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be possible for the Burren in County Clare, which is internationally known, to be twined with Burren in County Cavan, which is only nationally known at the moment. Perhaps it will become internationally known in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or myself hunting for votes in west Cavan because Deputy Smith would seem to have them all tied up with his compliments to the local councillor which are well deserved as that man has a good interest in that locality.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill as it is important to update legislation. However, there are some aspects of this Bill which will cause much discomfort to many people involved in the very work the Minister is trying to do. I agree with Deputy Smith that we must approach this project on a partnership basis as a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude will not succeed.</P>
      <P>The people in the hunt clubs and the gun clubs are as interested as the Minister or I in the preservation of wildlife and the protection of rural life. They have approached me about aspects of the Bill relating to kennels, the keeping of hounds and beagles and the new levies which will be imposed. The levies will make life impossible for these ordinary law abiding people who are interested in and have a tremendous understanding of wildlife. Before she dots the final &ldquo;i&rdquo; and crosses the final &ldquo;t&rdquo;, I suggest that the Minister talk to these people as they have information and knowledge.</P>
      <P>What annoys me is the individuals or groups outside Leinster House with the placards and gruesome photographs of foxes, badgers and other wildlife which have been killed, battered to death and torn apart by terriers and beagles. There is not an iota of truth in one of those photographs. The Minister or I could take such photographs any night of the week. When travelling along a road one will see foxes, which darted across the road and were hit by a passing car or lorry, lying dead. It is a terrible sight. We could take a photograph of that and say it is the result of a hunt. The people involved in hunt clubs do not brutalise or abuse wild animals. The same applies to badgers which one regularly sees dead along the roadside. It can be quite dangerous to try to avoid them. They can cause motor accidents. We need to take a balanced approach. The sooner that person or those individuals move away from the front gates and stop blackguarding people who have a far keener and better interest in wild life the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sport and enjoyment associated with wild life has to be understood. Many people are involved in hunt clubs, horse mounted hunts and walking hunts. It is a beautiful sight to see a hunt and the beagles. The beagles chase the fox and those on the hunt take off after them on their horses. It is not for the kill &ndash; the last thing they want is for the fox to be killed. Usually the fox is <Col N="1067" /> not killed as he is far smarter than the hound and he gets a good start. It is a healthy exercise. Those hunting on foot are more ordinary and are not into horses and the gear which goes with it as that is for more affluent hunt people in Meath and Kildare, and we wish them well.</P>
    <P>In County Cavan one sees ordinary people going out on foot every Sunday with their little terriers or hounds. They may chase a hare up to the highest hill top, watch the hunt, listen to the hounds and see the hare scooting off as happy as Larry. The last thing they want is a kill. It may happen &ndash; so be it &ndash; but that is wild life. The fox will kill rabbits and hares for food. We must have balance in that regard.</P>
    <P>Given the number of badgers and foxes in our countryside, they must be curtailed. Sheep farmers must protect their sheep. It is not uncommon for people in urban areas, many of whom have an interest wild life, to see the urban fox which cannot get food in farmland. Sheep are now brought in for the lambing season and the fox is making its way into our towns and villages. It is not uncommon for people to see them in their back gardens and I have been told they have been seen raiding refuse bins. Such a fox is desperate and dangerous. If he cannot get lambs or rabbits, he will rob the nests of partridges and pheasants when they are not nesting. He might take the pheasant itself and we are left with the little chicks unattended. We need a balance in nature.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the spread of disease. I do not know whether the fox is responsible for the spread of bovine TB in our animals but there is a serious question mark over badgers. The badger population, therefore, has to be curtailed and dealt with. I will leave that to the people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who are doing research on that and who are removing badgers in certain areas in a humane manner by gasification. I know people will say it is outrageous and should not happen, but it must. We must have commonsense. I appreciate and understand that people who have tremendous knowledge in this area are there to protect the wild life.</P>
    <P>The practice of farming has changed. When I, Deputy Martin Brady, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister were growing up, meadows were not mowed until the end of June or the beginning of July when the corncrake had nested, the chicks were able to look after themselves and had made their way to safety in the hedgerow. Now the practice of silage making begins at the end of April so those birds are practically extinct, which is sad. It is, however, because of farming practice. If there had been a little more foresight in regard to the preservation of these species, which are not totally extinct and are found in some parts, part of the meadow should have been left aside and the farmer would have had to have been compensated.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Smith said, in the constituency we represent, every inch of good soil is important <Col N="1068" /> and one cannot mow a meadow and leave a portion of it aside without some compensation as it is needed for hay for cattle for the following winter. If it had been possible to leave some ground in the centre of the field where these bird generally nest, the farmer would have done that. At that time the farmer mowed with horses and would have been annoyed to come across a corncrake's nest when it was too late and see the little eggs smashed. The farmer would have been annoyed that he had not lifted the blade and passed over it. The advent of the tractor, however, made that impossible.</P>
    <P>In regard to grant-aid to gun clubs for restocking, more money should be made available to them. It is ironic but only last week the Cavan and District Gun Club approached me about developing a sanctuary in the area I represent around Butlersbridge, which is a small village and farmland. They want to develop a sanctuary and to stock it with pheasant and partridge. I wholeheartedly support that, as do my neighbours. However, they have little funding for this project so they will fundraise, run a draw and so on. If we are serious about it, grant aid should be available for that type of work. Nobody can set foot on a sanctuary or do any shooting there, not even the landowner. That is a positive approach to preservation, and it is not unique. That happens countywide in Cavan, constituency-wide and nationwide. I emphasise that there are people who have a great interest in hunting, but to blackguard them as people who are out to trample across people's land and shoot all forms of wild life is unfair. There are cowboys in every walk of life, even in politics. However, 90% of people involved in the preservation of wildlife, gun clubs or hunt clubs are honourable, upright and decent people who want to protect what is a benefit for all. There is nothing nicer than to go out for a walk on an evening in May or June and see pheasants, partridge and so on. It is beautiful.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another aspect relating to hunt clubs. The Minister may have heard the suggestion that she take out of the Bill a reference to the control of beagles and terriers. When the hunt starts and the hare or the fox takes off, one cannot tell the hounds to stop at the farm of Andrew Boylan or Síle de Valera, that they cannot go in there. The people following the hunt know that, but we are talking about wild animals. When the dog is up and the hunt is on, they take off. I understand that the people who drafted this Bill felt they could impose this regulation and make the hunt club responsible for trespass. If that is the case, it is a cynical way of winding them up instead of being forthright and saying they do not want hunting to take place. I know that is not the intention. In her reply the Minister might state whether she is withdrawing that proposal or whether it is to be part of the Bill. As a rural Deputy it seems silly to me to suggest that a dog can go up this hill but not into that field. I do not know how that could be controlled. I hope that is not the intention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Let me address the question of pollution. I too was in Ballyjamesduff for the ICMSA meeting. I compliment ICMSA and IFA members who have tremendous interest in the environment. The meeting was an open night of awareness for farmers to inform them about controlling pollution, what grants are available and how to go about it on a partnership basis. Cavan County Council was represented there and there was a tremendous discussion. No farmer would wilfully pollute the waterways adjacent to his farm because his cattle depend on them for drinking water. However, it has happened that silage effluent and the runoff from a farm have made their way into streams and rivers, although not intentionally. The Minister and her officials may not believe it but 15 or 20 years ago when silage making started here, there were grants for putting in silage slabs. Part of the grant included a little drain from the silage slab leading to the nearest stream. This was grant aided, and the grant was not paid unless the drain was completed to take away the runoff. The Minister's officials can check back to see whether that is a fact. I stand over it because I benefited from it. The ignorance was not all on one side. It was not just farmers who were ignorant about the problems of silage effluent. Officials who had done the research came up with the idea of silage slabs rather than making silage on ground that would soak up the effluent which would eventually make its way to streams and rivers. That has all changed now. Farmers must have a tank and farmyards have improved.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous benefits from the REP scheme which can be seen on farms which are involved in it. However, there is one problem which is raised time and time again. It relates to the continuous cutting of hedgerows. Under the REP scheme hedges have to be cut. However, these hedges are the habitat of nesting birds. It is not necessary and does not improve the appearance of hedges to cut time like this. They should be tidied, cut on each side, but they should be allowed to grow to their full height so that birds can nest and be safe. The insistence on topping them at three or four feet high takes away shelter for animals and a place for birds to nest. That is not necessary. I agree that hedges should not be allowed to grow wild and should be faced on both sides, but they should not be topped. Not only do they provide a habitat for wild birds but shelter for animals on cold days or from a sudden shower of hailstones. The old farming stock long ago made land of rocks and stones and channel clay and they developed hedgerows for the purpose of shelter. They knew what they were doing. These hedges provided a habitat for wildlife. The Minister should ask the REPs people about that and about the approach to farmyard waste, which is not waste but farmyard fertiliser. Modern tanks hold animal manure which can be used to fertilise the land and should not be described as waste. If it is properly applied, we can cut down on the use of artificial fertiliser, which is the greatest source of pollution. In weather such as we have, when <Col N="1070" /> growth is slow, farmers are advised by their Teagasc advisers to spread nitrogen, but the grass is not fit to absorb it and it flows off into the streams. Modern spreaders are so powerful that unless they keep a distance from a drain or a river, it is sprayed directly into them, unlike farmyard manure which is put on with a slurry tank so that the farmer can target the field exactly and protect rivers, and it is not as polluting as artificial manure. If farmers had a different mind set in relation to applying farmyard manure rather than artificial fertilisers, we could cut down substantially on the cost of farming because artificial fertilisers are extremely costly, and we would get the same grass growth and the same benefit, albeit a little later in the year. However, it will be equally rich and give as much benefit as grass grown with artificial fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a keen interest and a great awareness of the problems. I suggest that she talk to the people who are directly involved and ask for advice before she finalises the Bill, and she will have the full support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and her officials are to be congratulated on bringing this extensive and balanced range of protective measures before the House. This Bill contains a range of what might be described as disparate and individually unrelated measures. However, they all serve the common purpose of increasing the range of protective measures aimed at protecting our wildlife and ecological heritage in the widest sense.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill seek, in a flexible way, to create a positive environment for the protection of species, natural habitats, biological diversity, fossil remains and so on. It seeks to balance the rights and interests of individual citizens, property owners, voluntary organisations, business interests, economic development and all users of our natural environment. It seeks to do so in so far as possible in a constructive, consensual, educational fashion without recourse to compulsion or coercion except as a last resort where it is patently clear that unscrupulous elements and predatory criminals are prepared to defy the law, custom and the common good and place their own greedy short-term and short-sighted interests before everything else.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate that we came late to economic and industrial development. We have been given enormous opportunities for preserving our natural heritage by virtue of the fact that, for a variety of historical reasons, the Industrial Revolution passed us by. I hope that future generations will be spared the physical depredations that development and the operation of heavy industry have wrought on the landscapes and wildlife of many countries, including that of our nearest neighbour, over the past few centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also fortunate in having a relatively unspoiled and under-populated countryside, at least by European if not by world standards. One has only to visit the Netherlands to fully appreciate how well endowed Ireland is in terms of <Col N="1071" /> unspoiled, undeveloped countryside. We are experiencing economic growth on an unprecedented level and prosperity is, with some exceptions which the Government in conjunction with the social partners is intent on tackling, generally benefiting society. One of the benefits of rising prosperity is that it gives us the opportunity and freedom from economic pressure to reflect on our surroundings and consider what we can do best to fulfil ourselves as individuals and as a people once we have satisfied basic economic needs.  One of the key areas that can contribute to the physical and psychological well-being of the nation is the care and preservation of our natural environment and the flora and fauna that inhabit it. We are doubly fortunate &ndash; I keep repeating this because it is unprecedented in Irish history &ndash; that we can, because we have the means to do so, plan our further economic and social development with due regard and equal consideration being given to our natural surroundings as opposed to it having to take a poor second place to activities, some of which were undoubtedly destructive, but were driven by development needs, economic want and so on.</P>
    <P>We must be practical in what we do and in this regard it is ironic and not sufficiently appreciated by the public at large that the landscapes in which we live are entirely manmade. This island has been continuously farmed for more than 5,000 years, as anyone who has visited the stunning landscape and interpretative centre at the Céide Fields in Mayo will know. What we see as landscape anywhere in this country has been shaped and fashioned by human beings. It is doubly ironic that if existing legislation to protect our environment and natural surroundings had been in place 4,000 or 5,000 years ago we would not now be protecting the Burren as we know it because it is a landscape that did not occur naturally. It resulted from the depredations of Neolithic &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo; farmers. The development of industry &ndash; thankfully nowadays most of our industries are clean &ndash; and the development of our physical infrastructure can go forward in a careful and planned way which will have full regard to the needs of citizens and society and will preserve our environment, its flora and fauna for this and future generations.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a system to afford permanent legal protection to national heritage areas against destruction or significant damage and provides for a system of compensation and appeals for NHAs similar to that already in place for special areas of conservation. Many of the areas to be designated are already well known and local authorities have been furnished with maps of what is expected to be included in NHAs so they can take full account of them in their planning deliberations. This level of co-operation is most welcome and it is vital if our natural heritage is to be properly protected. In the circumstances, it is important that in framing legislation and in giving effect to <Col N="1072" /> statutory measures the fullest possible consultation takes place across Departments and proper cognisance is taken of policy development in related areas or areas which could impact on the protection of the natural environment. Deputy Boylan referred to this and mentioned that there are open meetings where farmers are advised on pollution and the damage it can do. There are incentives to encourage the elimination of pollution, which is good.</P>
    <P>It has not always been the case that the natural environment was protected at either national or EU level. I have in mind particularly the damage caused to many of our important western landscapes and wildlife habitats by overpopulation of hillsides and consequential overgrazing by sheep. The vast increase in sheep numbers is directly attributable to the headage payment system devised in Brussels to support farming populations. This policy now has to be modified, if not reversed, at some cost but only, unfortunately, after widespread environmental damage has been done. On the other hand, it is important to ensure the updating of planning law currently going through the House in the form of the planning Bill, which is designed to remedy the defects of existing planning laws particularly the 1963 Act, is not negated in any way. The 1963 Act has been used to all intents and purposes as a cranks' charter and has been repeatedly used by minority interests to disrupt and delay many worthwhile and necessary social and economic projects. I hope the very necessary measure in the planning Bill designed to eliminate obstacles, free up bottlenecks and generally render the planning process more speedy and efficient will not be negated by the additional protective measures for wildlife set out in the Bill. In this connection I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that there has been full consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, his Department and the Attorney General on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been at pains to describe the Bill as a balanced one that strives to take account of a multiplicity of interests, some of which are competing, and I hope that due consideration has been given to the concern I expressed about possible conflicts of interest at policymaking level. I am pleased the Minister has devised an appropriate legislative strategy for the protection of NHAs which enables her to secure her ends without having recourse to compulsory purchase. This exemplifies the positive and co-operative philosophy of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that farmers who join REPS in these areas will qualify for additional payments for adhering to appropriate or traditional farming practices in proposed NHAs. The REPS is becoming increasingly popular among farmers who are beginning to realise that intensive farming is a mixed blessing rather than the economic panacea it was touted as being some years ago. It has downsides in the degradation of the farming environment and biological diversity generally <Col N="1073" /> and many farmers are content to revert to traditional and natural conservational practices if they receive adequate encouragement and support. There may be hope for the corncrake yet, if they take that line.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the existing protection for hedgerows. This has been a concern of mine that I have consistently pursued with a number of Ministers. Hedgerows are also manmade constructs but they are, in both rural and urban areas, a most important source of wildlife. Reference has been made to birds nesting and so on. As Deputy Boylan has stated, hedgerows are being cut down but there is no need for that. They should not be topped but tidied up. They offer shelter and are a habitat for birds. The extension of the period of protection and the restriction on local authorities and State agencies on cutting during specified periods, except for health and safety reasons, is a valuable contribution to further protecting nesting birds.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of a competency test for hunters. The shooting scene has changed radically over the past 40 to 50 years with the decline of game bird and rural human populations. When I was young and growing up in a rural area one automatically acquired a knowledge of wildlife, firearms and hunting practices. These were imbibed as naturally and as unconsciously as mother's milk and were passed on traditionally from father to son. The key element in such traditional training was respect for game birds and their conservation as well as that of the hunting environment. Those days are gone and many of those now hunting have never experienced such formative and educational processes which provide a naturally solid grounding in conservation as well as the pleasures of the hunt. The provisions of the Bill are an important effort to remedy this deficiency. I am glad to hear the Minister will only put systems in place following close examination and consultation with the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>The proposed measures in relation to the regulation of commercial shoot operators, which are a related issue, will put this important source of tourist activity and revenue on a proper statutory footing and will ensure that only those who have full regard to wildlife law and conservation needs are permitted to operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in penalties provided for in the Bill. They will provide effective deterrent powers and are far more commensurate with the scale of the offences, which are not only crimes against wildlife but crimes against society, in that they deprive us of our natural heritage and the sense of well being and completeness we derive from it.</P>
    <P>Stiff penalties, including for the first time prison sentences, are essential if we are to protect our wildlife. They are a necessary supplement to such initiatives as the recently announced programme to introduce the golden eagle once again to the national parks on the western seaboard. In this connection I note that some of the farming <Col N="1074" /> communities are raising once again the ill-informed and falsely based view that eagles are major predators on new born lambs. This is the type of factually incorrect, irrational and emotional response which led to the slaughter and extinction of the eagle population over 100 years ago. In this context as in many others, I would ask the Minister and her Department to put more resources into educational programmes for conservation and the protection of wildlife. Bodies such as ENFO do valuable work in this area but much more can be done to educate citizens of all ages. I strongly urge the Minister to support the many positive measures in this wide ranging and complex Bill with effective publicity and educational programmes. I thank the Minister and her officials for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I understand the Minister had a difficult task formulating this comprehensive Bill. I purport to highlight and support many of its initiatives and to bring to the Minister's attention the widespread concerns in respect of certain elements of the Bill. Some of the matters I wish to raise are common to the Minister's constituency and mine.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago the Minister expressed concern, through the media, about the application and effect of many EU directives following implementation at ground level. Therein lies many of the problems and controversies highlighted in the past few years since the legislation on EU directives on SACs, in particular, were signed. Various concerns have been expressed in regard to signed EU directives. I have no doubt the Minister is aware that Fianna Fáil people have said the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has responsibility given the way he accepted them. Given the views he expressed when signing the EU directives on SACs and the boglands, he was of the opinion that they would eliminate the use of the sausage machine and the destruction being caused by them. It was the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who put the final signature to it because it came within his area of responsibility at the time. He has since disclaimed responsibility for his actions.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, the Minister has an opportunity to redress some of the mistakes, if they were mistakes, by introducing amendments to address these serious concerns which will not go away. Recently a national group, the SAC Alliance, held a recent meeting in Portumna at which some of the Minister's officials attended. Also in attendance were representatives from Waterford and from Kerry to Donegal, including all the western representatives. That organisation has serious reservations. While some of its demands are unreasonable, its legitimate concerns must be taken into account. I urge the Minister to consider those concerns and to allay its fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> I ask the Minister to make a definitive statement, for the benefit of those who have used the situation to misrepresent anybody who has taken account of it, on access to and availability of bogs for cutting turf. Those who want to misrepresent facts say one must have planning permission while others say it is not necessary and that they will do so with or without planning permission. The Minister would do a fantastic job for many if she were to make a definitive statement outlining the position clearly and unequivocally. I hope she will express the view that those who have traditionally gone to the boglands, whether to raised or blanket bogs, and do not want to be prevented from doing so will be allowed to continue without interference and without seeking the permission from rangers. When one mentions the word &ldquo;ranger&rdquo; in our part of the country, what is one talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few cowboys around here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not bring the cowboys into it. That is the reality and there are people who are convinced that is the situation. I heard one of the Minister's officials say one has to get permission from a ranger. I have no doubt about that. I asked him to clarify the situation. I can give an example. There are people who have traditionally gone to Clonmoylan bog on the verge of the Shannon to cut domestic turf &ndash; two or three tractor/trailer loads annually. They do no harm and do not desecrate the environment. If they have to ask permission from a ranger, where would they find one? This is so ridiculous that it would not deserve comment but for the fact that it is a real concern.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the position once and for all. I recognise there are commercial operators but that is different. Will the Minister acknowledge that these people will have to operate within the law and do what is necessary? Nobody wants to turn that on its head. They are ordinary small landowners and individuals who have had turbary rights for generations. The idea that they would be taken from them is foreign. Irrespective of who steps in their way, politicians, Ministers, Governments or the EU, they are intent on levelling that once and for all. They are emotional about it but sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious reservations about planning permission even for the commercial operators. Local authority officials are already under extreme pressure because of staff shortages and another layer of planning procedure will create chaos. I have nothing against conservationists but they are the most likely people to object to every planning notice they see. In the interest of ordinary every<Col N="1076" /> day activities we must be fair and try to accelerate planning applications for the commercial development of boglands. Otherwise a planning application could be submitted early in the season and delayed by planning procedures so that the season would have passed before the turf could be saved.</P>
    <P>There must be consistency among Departments. For example, a few years ago the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications gave grants for the drainage and development of bogs. Important work such as road building in bogs was carried out to make the extraction of turf easier. This was at a time when oil prices were escalating and it was felt that we needed to use our own energy source. In a short time that policy has been reversed and the commercial development of bogs is being discouraged. Other Members have referred to other inconsistencies.</P>
    <P>There is also inconsistency in the administration of the REP scheme. A few years ago the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development gave grants for the removal of hedgerows in order to make large open fields. These grants were important for farmers who did fantastic work to update farming techniques and made farming more profitable. That policy has also been reversed. Some officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development appear to be making up the rules regarding REPS as they go along. Last week <i>The Clare Champion</i> reported the Minister's statement that she welcomed the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's decision to rectify the situation with regard to winterages and commonages. That decision was prompted by my request that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development rectify a blatant inconsistency in the REP scheme. When the announcement was made the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltach and the Islands welcomed it. I also welcome it because it has had a serious effect on the smallholders of north Clare and south Galway, adjoining constituencies. It is time the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development put in place a workable scheme which the Department can defend when challenged. It is good that the Department can accept criticism of a scheme and correct it, but in many cases the application and interpretation of schemes by officials is inconsistent and differs from one area to another. Officials in the Galway office appear to be particularly stringent. My criticism has been proved well-founded in many cases. Often what is judged to be good for County Galway is not good for other counties. As a result of this legislation, other Departments which share responsibility in this area must be brought together so that the situation can be streamlined.</P>
    <P>In the callows of County Galway parties and individuals from outside are invited to hunt and particularly to shoot. French hunters are the most notorious and will wipe out anything that moves and has a feather. It is important that this practice be eliminated. I have seen hunters provided with <Col N="1077" /> the necessary equipment and shooting indiscriminately at a time when cover is minimal and the birds are at their most vulnerable. If this legislation deals with this problem it will be very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>There is a new national plan for the development of roads and sites of historical and archaeological importance. Consultants who are now inevitably designing roads and routes must come across such sites. A consultation process must be readily available so that as soon as a site is identified the local authority, in conjunction with the Minister's Department and all the relevant agencies, can move quickly so that delays are kept to a minimum. We know that sometimes a local authority, the National Roads Authority or some other agency are delighted when an obstacle halts a development because the finances are not in place. That situation has now changed and there is no shortage of money for the development of roads. It is important that procedures be put in place so that difficulties can be quickly eliminated.</P>
    <P>When the callows in east Galway, Meelick and Eyre Court, were flooded two years ago a voluntary group came together with the local farmers and made an agreement that the nesting places of the corncrakes would be preserved. The farmers agreed to change their pattern of agriculture and that the meadows would not be cut for hay or silage until July or August. This agreement, made on a voluntary basis, indicates the farming community's concern with conservation and this must be acknowledged. In a recent season the summer floods in the callows came early and fodder was ruined overnight. When I, with a farming group, met the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, in Ballinasloe it was indicated to the farmers that they would be compensated because their commitment to conservation had caused a tremendous loss. Farmers had watched their bales of hay floating down the Shannon or had seen them destroyed with silt and mud caused by the flooding. These farmers are entitled to be cynical about any promise of compensation. Despite that, they have maintained their commitment to conservation and continue the agreed pattern of agriculture. In such instances it should be possible to compensate without fuss or hassle those who are genuinely committed to conservation. It was obvious to those who had visited the site that the individuals concerned had lost heavily and were entitled to compensation because of their positive commitment to the concept. Should there be a recurrence, all concerned should be dealt with reasonably. Would it be possible, if a legitimate case can be made by the Government, to have some of the EU directives in place either revoked or eased temporarily? The Minister expressed concern about this matter recently.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that there is to be an extension of NHAs and SCAs? In doing so will we go overboard and restrict further the activities of those living in the areas concerned where one <Col N="1078" /> can no longer obtain planning permission from the county council? Despite all the talk about rural renewal are plants, birds and animals now more important than people? I cannot reconcile those two aspects. It confirms once again that there is a lack of consultation between Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. In recent years concern has grown about the protection of wildlife. Those who hunt and those who are concerned with conservation have seen an increase in the threats and dangers to wildlife and the environment which supports it. While the tourism industry benefits by way of visitors from continental Europe who come here on shooting holidays, there is considerable concern that their approach to shooting and hunting is not in keeping with traditional practice here. Legislation which will reasonably and realistically control the activities of all is therefore welcome.</P>
      <P>The simple assumption that those who hold firearm licences are familiar with best hunting practices cannot be supported. The introduction of a separate hunting licence to be issued after an applicant has successfully demonstrated a knowledge of and competence in the fundamentals of good hunting practice and conservation is the way forward. While this will pose problems when applied to foreigners, it is important to ensure the norms and standards which apply here are respected. Hunting, correctly conducted, is a way of life and adds much to the enjoyment of rural living but it must be conducted in a non-offensive manner and based on commonsense.</P>
      <P>The powers relating to the creation and control of natural heritage areas are important as is the creation of rights of way to allow reasonable access. It is reasonable that activities allowed should be controlled and regulated. It follows therefore that when unapproved works are undertaken the Minister should be able to ensure restoration of the area concerned to its former state. It is equally important that true compensation is paid to landowners in respect of the restrictions placed on their land holdings and the inconvenience caused by the creation of rights of way. It is important that the views of landowners are taken into account in deciding on the least intrusive routes while serving the purpose of their creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with the protection of flora and fauna, including plants and seeds. As commerce becomes more competitive and world networking increases, so too does the danger to our flora, fauna, wildlife and animals. We must ensure at all times that our legislation gives the Minister of the day the capacity to address fully the challenges that may be presented to our countryside retreats. The habitat of the wild must be preserved and protection afforded to enforce control. While I appreciate the need to provide for the unintentional killing or destruction of breeding and resting places of a protected wild animal, it is very important that the Minister <Col N="1079" /> ensures there is within the Department sufficient resources and personnel to ensure an accidental event is a rare occurrence. Such events should be reported in the annual report, thereby highlighting their significance.</P>
    <P>There is a need to exercise control over those who shoot and to ensure those who hunt commercially exercise proper restraint. This is a very important aspect in the long-term good management of the nation's stock. The manner in which the issue of the conservation of hedgerows is addressed is also important. In this context the inclusion of the date of 1 April is to be welcomed. Nesting birds must be fully protected from danger from whatever source.</P>
    <P>There are excellent wildlife habitats on the doorstep of this city. I refer in particular to Bull Island, Howth Peninsula and Baldoyle Estuary. Bull Island has been much in the news of late because of the silting of the Blue Lagoon and the damage this is causing to the wildlife habitat of brent geese and other birds which winter here. The experts say that the causeway should be breached near the interpretative centre to allow a flow of water through to prevent silting and preserve the habitat. The area is visited by many foreign visitors.</P>
    <P>Excellent work has commenced on the Howth Peninsula to divert the north Dublin drainage scheme from Sutton to Ringsend, thereby eliminating the outfall at the nose of Howth. While this is a welcome development, pollution is still being caused by sewage which is being washed up on strands in the vicinity of Sutton. The county manager informed me recently that rubbish is escaping from landfill sites and gathering on beaches. Nesting birds have been killed as a result.</P>
    <P>The Howth Peninsula is unique in the sense that a special amenity area order is being prepared under which building will no longer be allowed on East Mountain which provides an excellent habitat for wildlife. All the necessary works have been completed by Fingal County Council and the special amenity area order is on the desk of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The inspectors should have reported on the public inquiry by now. I ask the Minister to take the matter up with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and have the special amenity area order made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Baldoyle Estuary is the over-wintering area for brentgeese. This area was twinned some years ago with Polar Bear Pass. It is a pleasure to see the wildlife in this estuary when travelling from Baldoyle to Portmarnock. However, there are no facilities for people who want to walk along that area to see the wildlife. A pathway should be constructed from Baldoyle to Portmarnock so that people can walk along the area and view the breathtaking scenes of wildlife feeding there. Hides and seats should also be provided so people can view the wildlife in comfort. I ask the Minister to work with the Minister for the Envir<Col N="1080" /> onment and Local Government to confirm the special amenity area order for Howth and to extend it to the Baldoyle Estuary because of its unique quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the few people with reservations about this Bill because of the restrictions it places on farmers. I listened this morning to Members talking about yellow hammers and lapwings becoming extinct. However, farmers and their wives and families are becoming extinct. The Land League was started in Mayo by Michael Davitt. I warn the Minister and the Government that people resent SACs, NHAs and the restrictions being placed on them by central government and Europe. I hope this Bill will not further upset and pressurise farmers in an effort to get more people out of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>We were told SACs or NHAs would not interfere with young couples or farmers' sons and daughters living in areas close to their homes. However, if people go to the local authority to talk about planning permission, they will be shown maps of SACs or NHAs which cannot be interfered with because they contain natural habitats. What can be done to help young couples in Ballycroy, Achill and Belmullet? People are angry and frustrated at what is happening.</P>
      <P>When we introduce legislation, the Minister expresses one view on how it should be implemented but local authority officials have another view. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was in Westport recently and he told the farmers one thing but the planning office in Mayo County Council told them something else. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, made a statement at the meeting that he was concerned about planning. Why does he not introduce rules and regulations to simplify it? </P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister last week about a ring fort outside Castlebar which is falling down. The farmer on whose land it is wants to knock it because he is afraid that children will be injured or killed by falling stones and he will be sued. The reply I got from a civil servant, who does not come from the west because he has no understanding of rural life, stated that the farmer should fence around it. We cannot have regulations and rules which state the farmer cannot knock the fort because it is protected by Dúchas but then the Department will not do anything about it. That is not fair or morally right. I was disappointed with the Department's response.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Sargent and the Green Party do not agree with me but he does not live in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. The Deputy should go to north County Dublin sometime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about north County Dublin but I know a lot about the west. The Deputy and his comrades tell us how we <Col N="1081" /> should preserve rural Ireland but they do not tell us how we can make a living in it. We must stand up to people like the Deputy and to the Minister and the Government and I will lead the campaign if necessary. We are not looking for anything unreasonable, only a way of life.</P>
      <P>Rural Ireland is a lovely place to live, so I invite people from Dublin, Cork or other European cities to visit it to see the green fields. There are no rezoning problems in rural Ireland and councillors will not have to be paid to rezone land. We will assist people in whatever way we can but they must deal with the SACs and NHAs.</P>
      <P>One regulation is that county councils cannot cut hedges on main country roads during the mating season. People in rural Ireland are being attacked by the Government and by Europe. I love birds and animals. I do not like cruelty to animals and I do not agree with blood sports. Farmers are the only protectors of rural life and of animals. Who suffered most during the BSE crisis? This problem was created in another country but farmers in rural Ireland suffered. There is more concern about the birds and animals than there is about people. Something must be done about the SACs and NHAs because people resent them.</P>
      <P>Ten acres of the land beside people's homes should be zoned so they can use it to build a house for their son or daughter. This area of land should not be designated a special area of conservation or a natural heritage area. If they own the land they should have a right to build a house for their son or daughter on it. The Minister must clarify the planning laws for the local authorities. Ten or five acres of land, depending on whether a farmer has more or less than 20 acres, should be zoned so they can build a house for their son or daughter without having to wait for officials from the Office of Public Works or the Department to make such a decision. People died for the land while taking stones from it to make a living and now European rules and regulations are preventing them from making that living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has done some work on creating a national park in Ballycroy. However, there is only one decision to be made. Funding was provided in the Operational Programme 1994-1999 but the Minister had to divert it because it would not be finished by 1999. When the former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins, was leaving the Department, only one decision had to be made. The Minister has a choice of six sites. I ask her to choose a site so we can move forward. This is a beautiful area with many natural resources, but it is deprived. More people leave the area than enter it and this measure would encourage the community and attract visitors who would see the natural habitat at its best. I am not being political when I say I am concerned about this area which has been disadvantaged for many years. The decision should be made and the Minister must deal with whoever is responsible. A number of sites have been offered to the Minister. <Col N="1082" /> However, whatever benefits arise from this initiative and wherever the building is located, Ballycroy and its community must benefit. That is from where most of the land is being taken and the area which most needs this development. The Minister should deal with this issue as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I also hope the Minister and the Government will deal with the public resentment over the rules and regulations. I do not know who the next Government will be but this issue will not go away. I have attended public meetings at which people were annoyed and aggravated. I am concerned that this House introduces laws, rules and regulations, only half of which are enforced. If something benefits the general community it is not implemented, if it is on an official site, officials take a view and implement the decision their way. We must deal with the resentment which exists.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers expressed concerns to me about the rights of people who enter their lands. Landowners must have rights and people must obtain permission to cross land. If people want to use land they must pay the landowner. A deal should be done between the landowner and the person who wishes to enter the land. If anything happens on these lands, the Minister, the Government or the courts will not protect farmers. If people lodge large compensation claims, farmers and their families will have to do the worrying as in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for which wildlife has waited a long time. I cannot understand how anyone could claim wildlife is getting the upper hand over the interests of humans. The long wait for this Bill shows how low a priority this issue has been for various Governments. The Minister has managed to bring the Bill to the floor of the House although in a staggered fashion, given it was published last July.</P>
      <P>This legislation is driven by the EU. For many years we have argued that membership of the EU was good for Ireland and that we benefited in all sorts of ways. This legislation is part of that deal but it is not painful. The only pain being caused at present is the enormous pain caused to wildlife given the many well meaning laws passed which have ensured that wildlife remains the silent victim in many decisions concerning planning, agriculture and other areas which, in themselves, are very worthwhile.</P>
      <P>However, I reject the specist mindset which refuses to acknowledge that God created all life, and not just humans, and that all life has rights and is entitled to respect. Wildlife is entitled to the protection of the State even though it cannot vote. Some people seem to think that only those who vote have rights. Children or the very ill cannot vote, yet they have rights. We need to be more broad ranging in our ethics than simply regarding humans who can vote as the ultimate decision makers in respect of what is right and who deserves protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> Wildlife habitat is rarely considered by humans deciding its fate. Even fellow humans receive scant consideration in decisions to rezone natural habitat areas, as evidenced by the many bizarre and disastrous rezoning decisions where even footpaths for humans were absent after building took place and remain absent many years later. Likewise, wildlife corridors have been omitted in many plans so that wildlife is the silent victim.</P>
    <P>This legislation must be greatly strengthened and many of its loopholes closed. We must also wildlife-proof legislation governing related issues such as planning, agriculture, education, when it comes to awareness, and foreign affairs, which can deal with migratory species for which Ireland has international responsibility. This Bill should be a touchstone for other Departments in terms of what needs to be changed in their remit.</P>
    <P>Special areas of conservation in particular will be used as a test of the effectiveness of this Bill in terms of our European obligations. The experience so far has not been good. For example, damage has been caused to an area in Brittas Bay which a landowner was informed would be designated as being of scientific importance. This seemed to be an alarm bell after which the area was partially destroyed. It is ironic that because a designated area is destroyed it cannot be redesignated because it lacks the scientific basis on which the original designation was based. We need to address this obvious loophole. There has been no legal action or no sign of such action in this case from Dúchas and the Minister should address this before the Bill becomes law as this area is supposed to be protected.</P>
    <P>On 7 March, the European Commission decided that special areas of conservation cannot be altered on cultural or economic grounds. This decision needs to be reflected on in Ireland because many decisions and recommendations, even those emanating from Dúchas, are conditional on cultural and economic criteria. This test case concerned Bristol Port and I urge the Minister not to fall into the same trap as those involved in that case who thought this decision could be watered down.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Dúchas has not done as good a job as people would expect, particularly those with an interest in wildlife. A black mark over the agency is its willingness to even consider opening State lands to hunting. This is an appalling sell out to the antics of blood sports enthusiasts. Such people have been given the cold shoulder in Britain which was the originator of many blood sports such as coursing and fox hunting. However, it seems that attempts are being made in Ireland to indulge the most barbaric examples of human behaviour which are to be seen in some of these activities. The Minister should not give way on the basic sanctuary which State lands provide for wildlife.</P>
    <P>I also hope she will reconsider the issue of night hunting. It seems that this has been argued for on the basis that the fox can be best controlled <Col N="1084" /> at night. However, the evidence is that the fox is not a major predator of lambs. Is the Minister considering a curfew so that people do not engage in night hunting which is a dangerous activity for her to endorse?</P>
    <P>Many landowers will resist provisions to allow people to bring ferrets, packs of hounds and so on onto land for the purposes of hunting. The Minister should consider the interests of landowners who, for years, have been subjected to intimidation by people and packs of hounds rambling across their land, either on foot or on horseback.</P>
    <P>We also have an international obligation to protect the interests of otters. However, even though otters cannot be hunted, mink hunting disturbs their habitat and otters are also hunted under the pretence of mink hunting. When the debate resumes, I will deal with deer hunting, hedgerows, badger snaring, bats and the protection of national heritage areas and special areas of conservation.</P>

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, it was not possible to debate them. However, with the ever increasing importance of the evolution of the European convergence process, it is more important than ever that we have the opportunity for such debates.</P>
      <P>I thank the staff and members of the committee, particularly Deputy Gay Mitchell who is the rapporteur for this report. Some of the reports were produced by the committee <i>en bloc</i>, while others were produced by individual rapporteurs. Each process has been most effective. It has put a great deal of stress and strain on the members of the committee. I thank them for their commitment to the task. Most of the work was extremely time consuming and tedious and required a high degree of concentration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> This debate is timely as we move towards the introduction of the euro coins and notes. We have heard discussions on that issue in recent days. There will be a greater concentration by the public on how the changeover will affect the consumer and prices.</P>
    <P>The committee set out to identify in its report the pitfalls and snags that affected the changeover to decimalisation in the early 1970s. At that time, consumers &ndash; the people who have to pay for most things &ndash; found themselves disadvantaged because the cost of items in the market place was rounded up.</P>
    <P>The euro changeover board has had the responsibility of monitoring progress and ensuring the public is fully aware of its rights and entitlements, what is likely to happen, how people are likely to be treated and how they should be treated under the process. It is fair to say that has been reasonably successful to date.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the entire business sector has responded in the way I would have liked, for example, in regard to the posting of dual pricing. Many businesses, shops and commercial outlets have done so, but some still need to respond in that area. For members of the public to be fully aware of their entitlements and to compare prices effectively, it is imperative that they become familiar with the changeover at an early stage.</P>
    <P>This report is just one of many the committee has made on EMU. We put particular emphasis on this aspect because of the degree to which this is likely to affect the commercial, industrial, economic and social life of the country. It is a response by the Irish economy to European integration and involvement in the European Union, of which Ireland is a very proud and active member. It is also essential that we continue to be an example to the rest of the European Union and that we encourage others to join EMU. It is important to have the right criteria for accession to membership of EMU and to maintain those criteria, because movement away from them tends to create obvious problems.</P>
    <P>One the main issues I mentioned is the question of dual pricing. I hope that will receive greater attention, particularly as we move towards 2001 because, otherwise, too many options will be left open. The danger then is that the whole credibility of EMU will be threatened, which we do not want to see happen.</P>
    <P>There are two follow-on reports to this one, one outlining the responses to the committee's recommendations and the other detailing the committee's discussions with the banks and the Director of Consumer Affairs. They have also been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The occasion should not pass without mentioning the importance of the single market and how effective it has been in terms of Ireland's economic development. Much emphasis is placed here and throughout Europe, especially by those who might like to criticise us, on the allegation that the whole basis for our economic success springs entirely from direct payments from the <Col N="1086" /> European Union. That is not so. It springs, essentially, from Ireland's ability to access the Single Market and develop our exports within that market.</P>
    <P>The next step in that process is obviously the single currency, within which businesses and individuals can carry on their enterprises without incurring the potential penalties of financial transactions. I marvelled that if one took £100 and travelled to the ten member states, changing the money at each airport, one would have no money left at the end. That is a dramatic and graphic illustration of how business and industry can be affected. The same applies to casual travellers and holiday makers. The introduction of the single currency will be of huge benefit to anyone who has to make financial transactions across Europe. I do not accept the suggestions from some quarters that this is some plot hatched in Brussels or elsewhere to bring everybody into line with the thinking of the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank has done its job so far. It has been asked to play a very difficult role. It has to bring together divergent currencies &ndash; with a great divergence in thinking &ndash; into a loop and encourage the various economies to progress together for the common good. That is not easy. However, at least a start has been made. If we continue that course of action, it will prove very fruitful and will benefit this and other EU countries, both those currently within the EMU and those which are likely to become part of it in the future.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, there will be many more preparations between now and then. The changeover board, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank will have many meaningful roles to play in that regard. The important thing from the point of view of the country and the future of EMU is to ensure that it works well in the interests of countries which are contributing to it and of the consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to thank the Joint Committee on European Affairs for its work in preparing this report and the two subsequent interim reports published last year. I understand that the committee yesterday decided to publish its fourth report, which will be carefully considered when it becomes available.</P>
      <P>The specific recommendations contained in the committee's report cover a wide area and a detailed response was provided to the committee last January on the recommendations which are the direct responsibility of the Department of Finance. I do not intend therefore to go into detail today on all of the committee's recommendations &ndash; my allotted time would not permit this in any event. However, I want to take this opportunity to discuss a number of important points in the committee's recommendations, beginning with the latest plans for the changeover to the euro currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The committee's first recommendation relates to the date for the introduction of euro notes and coins, and the length of time after that during which Irish and euro cash would circulate together. The committee suggests that the introduction date be put back from 1 January to 1 February 2002, to avoid the winter sales, and that the period during which euro notes and coins and Irish notes and coins will circulate together should be shortened from the permitted six months maximum to perhaps two months.</P>
    <P>As regards the date for introducing the euro, 1 January 2002 is enshrined in EU law and there is no prospect of changing it. However, the committee is quite right in its view that a six months dual circulation period would be far too long, and the national plan for the changeover to euro cash, which was prepared under the aegis of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and which was launched yesterday, envisages a dual circulation period of just under six weeks, with legal tender status being removed from Irish pound notes and coins at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002.</P>
    <P>I want to describe briefly how the changeover will work. Put simply, accounts in financial institutions will be converted to euro on E-day, 1 January 2002. From that date all cash going out will be in euro, with incoming Irish notes and coins being retained and not issued outwards again.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps emphasise that the changeover will happen as people go about their normal business. As the plan states, from 1 January 2002 people should continue to carry out their normal cash transactions, using their remaining Irish notes and coins first and acquiring euro notes and coins through one or more of the mechanisms outlined in the plan. The plan envisages that the bulk of cash transactions will be made in euro by the end of two weeks of E-day. From midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002, legal tender status will be withdrawn from Irish notes and coins, and there will be no obligation to accept Irish notes and coins.</P>
    <P>I should of course stress that the Oireachtas has the final say as to when legal tender status should be withdrawn from Irish notes and coins. The plan recommends that it should happen at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002, and a draft order to that effect will be laid before both Houses in the next session.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the organisations involved in drawing up the plan have included a specific commitment that they will carry out the changeover to the euro fairly and seek no advantage from the conversion. I heartily welcome that important commitment. I also thank all the organisations involved in drawing up the plan for their co-operation. It is good that the plan is being published now, nearly two years in advance. It will be widely circulated, and it should act as a stimulus to businesses and retailers to intensify their preparations so as to ensure the changeover goes as smoothly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The committee recommends that my Department lays a report on the continuing implications for the Irish economy of the stability and growth pact before the Oireachtas twice annually, before any such report is submitted to European institutions. The stability and growth pact requires countries participating in the euro zone to present stability programmes to the Council and the Commission. The aim of these programmes is to illustrate how member states intend to meet the objectives of the pact, in particular, the medium-term objective of maintaining a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus, thereby enabling them to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations without exceeding the reference value of a deficit of 3% of GDP even in adverse economic conditions.</P>
    <P>In line with the code of conduct for the preparation of national stability programmes, Ireland's stability programme is prepared in the context of the annual budget and takes account of developments resulting from the budget. Ireland's first stability programme, covering the period 1999-2001, was prepared in the context of the 1999 budget and was presented to the Dáil as part of the budget documentation on 2 December 1998, prior to its submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission requires that the stability programme updates also be prepared annually in the context of the national budget and be presented at, or around, the same time as the budget. Ireland's stability programme update covering the period 2000-2 was prepared in the context of the 2000 budget, and serves as an economic background to the budget. This update was presented to the Dáil as part of the budget documentation on 1 December last, prior to its presentation to the Commission. It is anticipated that, in line with EU procedural requirements, the stability programme updates will continue to be prepared in the context of the annual budget and presented to the Dáil prior to submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The joint committee expressed concerns about the problems that could arise for Irish indigenous industry from a possible sharp fall in the value of sterling. It must be appreciated that EMU creates a new policy environment. The use of the exchange rate as a policy tool at national level to respond to unfavourable exchange rate movements is no longer an option. An economic shock which affects the EMU area as a whole will be dealt with jointly by the member states and the relevant Community institutions, including the ECB. However, a successful response to any possible shock which affects Ireland in particular will depend to a large extent on how well the economy has been prepared in advance to cope with such an eventuality. Flexibility in adjusting costs to meet competitiveness requirements is now even more important than in the past. How this flexibility is to be achieved in the private sector is ultimately a matter for each enterprise to determine.</P>
    <P>The committee's report recommended that the campaigns of Forfás and the Euro Changeover <Col N="1089" /> Board of Ireland be re-examined so as to ensure that SMEs are targeted for special assistance. In fact, Forfás and the board maintain close links in their respective tasks of providing information for business and providing information for the public. For example, Forfás is represented on the board and a senior officer from the board's secretariat is on the management committee of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign. SMEs have always been a particular focus of the Forfás campaign, while the board is careful to include mention of the Forfás campaign in its public information material wherever appropriate. In addition, the ECBI operates a programme under which funds are provided to non-governmental organisations to promote awareness of the euro, and activities to promote awareness among SMEs are identified as one of the key areas for support. The current round of the programme was advertised last September; activities under it are to be concluded by June, and a fresh round will be advertised in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommends that part of the annual budget surpluses be allocated to investment in needed additional infrastructure in such a way as to attract private partnership co-funding. Investment by the Government has increased significantly in recent years in order to tackle the infrastructural deficit. The national development plan contains a substantial programme of investment amounting to £40.6 billion in 1999 prices over the period of the plan in the key areas required for continued economic and social development. These areas include roads, public transport, water services, energy, housing and health infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The funding necessary for the delivery of this programme is set out in the national development plan and will be included in the expenditure estimates for the relevant years, subject to the specific budgetary and expenditure parameters decided by the Government for those years. The national development plan includes a significant target for expenditure in public private partnership ventures. In the plan, PPPs are particularly focused on the economic infrastructure programme. Provision is included for £1.85 billion of PPP funding, including £1 billion for roads, £300 million for public transport and £550 million for environmental projects. This is a minimum target for PPPs.</P>
    <P>The committee suggests that consideration be given to the creation of a national contingency fund into which part of the forecasted future budget surpluses will be paid to provide for possible unforeseen events arising from EMU. On this issue, it should be noted that there is a general contingency provision in the budgetary arithmetic. This represents a prudent provision in the overall budgetary projections for the second and third year of the three year multi-annual budgetary cycle against possible adverse factors outside the control of Government. Examples are variability in tax buoyancy resulting from slower econ<Col N="1090" /> omic growth or exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>One major contingency which we can foresee is the greatly increased Exchequer costs associated with the aging of the population in the decades ahead. The Government has begun to address this long-term challenge. The bulk of the proceeds from the sale of Telecom Éireann plus an annual contribution of 1% of GNP is being set aside towards these future costs. Pension pre-funding will be established on a statutory basis later this year.</P>
    <P>I again thank the committee for its valuable work.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Durkan for his work on putting this report before the House and Deputy Gay Mitchell, who has done tremendous work on all the reports on EMU which have been put before the House. I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the fledgling single currency. My party was a keen advocate of the single currency, which represents a logical conclusion to the integration of the European Union. It will in our view facilitate trade and investment in the euro zone. It will also facilitate movement of workers across the euro zone and eliminate unnecessary transaction costs which have done more to add to the profits of banks than to benefit European citizens.</P>
      <P>It would be naive to ignore the fact that the euro has come in for criticism since its introduction at the beginning of last year. It has not performed as expected by some of its keenest advocates. Those who opposed the introduction of the currency have been keen to take comfort from the euro's decline to a position where it is now worth 20% less than its initial value.</P>
      <P>With regard to the euro's performance to date, it is far too soon to judge the success or otherwise of the new currency. For instance, the new notes and coins have not even been issued. The euro remains, in the minds of its citizens, a theoretical currency and we all know this will inevitably change.</P>
      <P>Media commentators have differed vigorously on the prospects for the single currency. Falls in its value are viewed in a damning light while rises in its value, particularly against the dollar, are viewed as signs of strength. The reality is that 18 months is but a blip in the life of a currency. We do not know as of yet how the euro will settle. In the meantime it is probably fair to say that its low value has helped invigorate the European economy, which is good for Ireland as that is where an increasing percentage of our exports are sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn against allowing the short-term perspective of the markets to dominate our thinking on these matters. Events in recent weeks have indicated the turbulence of markets. One of the reasons my party supported the introduction of the euro was that it would help eliminate uncertainty in relation to currency fluctuations. Currency speculators have too often damaged the living standards of working people in self-generated <Col N="1091" /> and often selfishly inspired binges. Ireland had experience of such speculation against us as recently as eight years ago.</P>
    <P>In this era of transnational capitalism it is important that an element of democratic control is restored in relation to currency values. Obviously the European Union is a much stronger vehicle in which to achieve that end than a state the size of Ireland. It is my party's view that the arrival of globalisation has increased not weakened the argument for strong international co-operation on economic issues. Economic and monetary union is one such example of this.</P>
    <P>There is some concern in Ireland that signs of an early entry by the British Government into the euro zone seems to be receding. There is no doubt that British membership of the euro zone would be of benefit to Ireland. Many British citizens, such as the workers in Rover, are also coming around to that view. However, as things currently stand the possibility of a British referendum on the issue early in the lifetime of the current Parliament seems less likely than it once was. On the other hand, I still feel that both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are keen to see British membership of the euro during their political careers.</P>
    <P>The initial concern of people about the prospects of Ireland being in the euro zone while Britain remained outside, was that our currency would appreciate not depreciate against sterling. Those concerns are not difficult to understand. Such a scenario would have put considerable pressure on Irish exporters, but it has not come to pass. On the contrary the opposite is the case. The value of our currency has fallen considerably against sterling. This has given rise to fears about the importation of inflation and the loss of macro-economic tools, like the power to raise and lower interest rates, to deal with it. It would be unwise to dismiss out of hand these concerns, but they should be put in perspective. As one who lived through the 1980s, inflation levels of 4% do not scare me as much as they may scare people used to rates of 1% and 2%. While there is no room for complacency, the recent OPEC agreement should deliver a reduction in pressure towards the end of the year. We know too that Government decisions on excise duties on tobacco and fuel have also contributed significantly to the recent rise. Despite claims that Irish economic requirements are out of synch with the priorities of the European Central Bank, movements in European interest rates have been upwards not downwards.</P>
    <P>It is too early to judge the success of the euro. However, I would point out that within a few years all existing members of the EU, with the possible exception of the UK, will be members. Commentators would dismiss a currency based on these firm foundations at their peril. The euro zone is among the most powerful trading blocks in the world, the vast majority of its trade being internal. When the euro becomes a real trading currency for the citizens of the euro zone I sus<Col N="1092" /> pect that an amount of the uncertainty that surrounds it will disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the report which was published at the beginning of last year, though it is dated December 1998. I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to act as rapporteur. On Wednesday this week we approved a further report on EMU which will be placed before the Dáil in due course and which raises some interesting issues.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Durkan and Wall for their kind words. By and large I am happy to acknowledge the responses to the recommendations of the report which we received from various agencies. In particular the report recommended that there should be a shorter changeover period, which has been taken on board.</P>
      <P>The report raises the dangers of Ireland not meeting the Maastricht criteria for EMU as a result of asset inflation, specifically housing inflation, and the way that could drive demand for higher pay increases and in turn fuel inflation. The report makes a specific recommendation in this regard. It might seem a peculiar context in which to raise the housing issue, but the recommendation which deals with this is central to us meeting the Maastricht criteria. For example, a married couple, one of whom is a nurse and the other a garda, cannot afford to buy a house in Dublin, something which was unthinkable in times gone by. If inflationary demands are made on the Exchequer or individual employers we will create difficulties for Ireland qualifying for EMU. Already the inflation rate is touching 5% on an adjusted EU basis, probably the highest figure in the EU, something about which we must be very concerned.</P>
      <P>I first became a councillor in 1979 on Dublin Corporation and in the early 1980s we were building in the region of 1,700 houses per year. This year, between housing starts and house purchases, the figure will be as low as 300 local authority houses. We did not have a bob in the 1980s and yet we could provide that level of local authority housing. The local authority now says it has no land. It must, therefore, buy private houses, thereby bidding up the price in competition with young married couples trying to purchase a home. The creation of a new bank of local authority housing would do much to resolve the housing problem and ensure that our inflation rate and its threat to the Maastricht criteria are brought under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the houses built by Dublin Corporation in the 1980s were located in the county and not within the city limits. When commentators reflected on the problems that created they said the councillors in the county area were not responsible for the housing because the corporation built it. However, that is just a technical, administrative matter. The houses have been handed over to the local authority in the county area. Would it be an enormous sin if the corporation were to build houses for newly wed couples <Col N="1093" /> and others in other counties, for example, County Leitrim? I do not know what Members from Leitrim would think about that but they could be built in consultation with the relevant local authority. If there was a proper public transport system in and out of Dublin, such a plan would contribute to alleviating the housing crisis. Dublin Corporation does not have to build all its houses within the city boundaries. We have the power to change. Some people will say that massive estates will be built, thereby, creating more social problems. That need not be so because the houses could be built and, from the beginning, 100% mortgages could be given to half the people buying them so that they become residents immediately.</P>
    <P>Vast housing estates were built in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown in the 1980s but after the Second World War suburbs such as, Crumlin, Drimnagh and Cabra were developed. They are now the most sought after addresses in the city. The long-term effect of local authority housing has been a success. There are problems in large estates in Tallaght and Clondalkin. However, 60% of housing in Tallaght is private while the local authority housing comprises three and four bedroom houses in well laid out estates. Some mistakes have been made from which we can learn but, as the report states, local authority housing has a contribution to make in terms of addressing the housing crisis and relieving inflation, which could be further fuelled by people having to seek more money to fund the purchase of a home. If supply is increased, demand will be met and prices will even out.</P>
    <P>That recommendation in the report was responded to in the weakest manner. A standard reply was issued. There needs to be a complete rethink of the entire local authority housing programme and perhaps when new estates are built houses should be allocated first to newly married couples in terms of the social mix. Would it be harmful to discriminate in favour of those who are married given that the system currently discriminates against them? Perhaps we can return to such thinking, thereby encouraging settled communities.</P>
    <P>I refer to the contribution of EMU to European integration. In the first half of the last century, 60 million Europeans, the majority of whom were in their 20s, died in two world wars which began in Europe because of rampant nationalism. Some nations thought that they were greater than others, had ambitions and felt it their right to have hegemony in a particular region backed up by bombs and bullets, when necessary. At the end of the Second World War a small number of people with vision got together to ensure that their differences would be resolved in order to ensure such events would not happen again. They formed the European Coal and Steel Community &ndash; steel, from which the weapons of war were fashioned, and coal, the energy used in the manufacture of such weapons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The concept of the European Union derived from that organisation. We must remind ourselves that the integration process, of which EMU is one element, is about peace and stability. Europe cannot prosper, whether it has one or one million currencies, if there is not peace and stability. The enlargement and integration process embarked upon by the EU involves peace and stability as a prerequisite. Nobody is telling Ireland what to do, for example, and Ireland is not telling everybody else what to do. Intergovernmental institutions and others, such as the Commission, have been agreed and they oversee the integration process. It is an important and welcome process and EMU is a vital part of it. We must try and impress upon member states, particularly Britain, the importance of EMU as part of the integration process in order to ensure that there will never again be loss of life such as that in the last century.</P>
    <P>The euro will in time challenge the pre-eminence of the dollar which will result in a decline in US influence and a rise in EU influence worldwide. To prepare for this role the EU should consider a high representative for the euro similar to that on common foreign and security policy. Such a representative could be a second Secretary-General on the EU Council of Ministers. The Ginance Ministers of the G7 reached a compromise effective from their meeting in Frankfurt in June 1999. Their meetings are split in two sections. The first part deals with the global economy and exchange rate developments. The President of the European Central Bank and the country holding the rotating presidency of the euro 11 represent the euro zone. The Finance Ministers of Germany, France and Italy attend, although their central bank governors do not participate. During the second part of the meeting all other international financial issues are discussed. The president of the euro 11 is not present but the governors of the central banks of Germany, France and Italy are together with the Finance Ministers. The EU is only invited to participate on those topics in the second session in which it plays a direct role. That format is cumbersome and untenable in the long-term. That issue was addressed in the most recent report on EMU which was approved by the committee on Wednesday and will be debated in the House at a future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and Members for their contributions. The points raised were indicative of the concerns of the public and also arise from a genuine concern to make EMU work to ensure the continued integration and co-operation of the European concept in line with the original vision of the founding fathers of the modern Europe. Tragically, Europe had to rise from its ashes in 1945, as Deputy Mitchell stated. It is now unfolding once again. New horizons are opening up and the danger of ultra-nationalism can come to the fore on such occasions. It is to be hoped, however, that econ<Col N="1095" /> omic and monetary union and the euro will ensure it does not happen to a disruptive extent. The original concept of one European currency was thought up by Napoleon. It was seen as a plot to achieve economic dominance alongside political and military dominance for one regime. In the run up to the debates on the Maastrict and Amsterdam Treaties it was suggested by the euro-sceptics that the idea of closer European co-operation was a similar plot.</P>
      <P>This process is vital to the well-being of this State and we play a central role in it. The smaller countries which are applicants for EU membership look to Ireland to see how things can be done effectively and how membership can be of enormous benefit. We should take our proper place on the European stage. We have gained from the co-ordination of economic and social policies. It is now recognised that small countries have a meaningful role to play, particularly in the stability of Europe. The introduction of the euro will contribute to that stability.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall mentioned that the British are still not members of the euro. It is hoped they will come on board. It may be beneficial to us that they are not on board but to move forward together in Europe, it is desirable that the British come on board. We all look forward to that day.</P>
      <P>Globalisation is a key area. If there are trade barriers and tariffs, such as currency exchange rates, it puts those involved in commerce at a huge disadvantage. It is particularly disadvantageous to the ordinary consumer who goes abroad for a holiday. He or she has to change money on leaving and on returning. Senator Brendan Ryan has been very critical of that area in the compilation of this report, as has Deputy Barrett. This springs from a recognition of the need to ensure that we do our job to the best of our ability and point out to the agencies involved &ndash; the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, IBEC and other commercial interests &ndash; the need to ensure there is no downside to the change over, that people will not be able to complain afterwards that they lost out.</P>
      <P>Economic and monetary union represents a commitment by the larger countries in the European Union to join the smaller countries under a single banner, to trade together and to use a currency which will not disadvantage anyone by virtue of geographic location, size or trade volume. We must strive for that. Scepticism will arise from time to time. That is healthy and we should not be discouraged by it. We have to move on and address the issues which arise and come to terms with them. If we do not, we are not doing our jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee is unusual in that it comprises members who would originally have been opposed to European integration and those who were totally committed to it. As part and parcel of the committee's investigation into European law, integration and development, it has argued the various concepts in an interesting manner and <Col N="1096" /> has adopted some of the positions of those who are totally committed and some of those who are totally opposed to the concept. It has arrived at a point where it can produce reports which enjoy the unanimous support of all members. Any committee of 19 people which can do that is not doing badly. It includes Members from all sides of the House, all of whom have made a major contribution. None of this has come without sacrifice on the part of the committee members. There have been tedious meetings, both behind the scenes and in public, and reports have been drawn up. It would be wrong not to mention the members who repeatedly give of their time. It is very hard to get everyone to attend every meeting because they have other commitments.</P>
    <P>Committee life is not easy. It is outside the limelight and is not the same as speaking in either House. Committees do not get the same degree of recognition in the national media or anywhere else. If the system is to work effectively for the benefit of the State it should be given more recognition. It is not true to say the work is uninteresting. It may appear to be at first glance but it is serious work which requires a great deal of commitment. If it does not receive just recognition, people will not want to be part of the committee system. Every item of European legislation is vetted by this and other committees. It is important legislation which has an impact on everyone and it is essential that we examine it and make recommendations. It is also essential that those in the business of vetting our work look in occasionally and report on it. If we are doing something wrong, let us hear about it. If we are doing something right, let us hear about that as well. I thank Members and look forward to the next debate on the large number of reports this committee has already laid before the House.</P>

      <P>I feel like some of the wildlife finding various sanctuaries in different parts of the country given the opportunities I am getting to speak on this Bill. I will resume where I left off, that is, dealing with a number of the species mentioned in the Bill. I was about to refer to the otter hunting ban before the debate was adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister plans to repeal section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, whereby the hunting of otters with hounds will be banned. This may sound like a wonderful step forward for those concerned about otters, and that includes many <Col N="1097" /> people outside Ireland given that it is one of the last places otters can be found. This is, however, an empty gesture as long as mink hunting with hounds is allowed. Other hunting packs, which no longer require a licence, can hunt otters with impunity under the guise of mink hunting. I have seen film footage of this happen and the amount of destruction and disturbance to otter habitats is, I am sure, illegal in a European context. I ask the Minister to consider that when dealing with amendments. Otters are designated category one status under EU law and they and their habitats should be strictly protected. Hunting mink with packs destroys otter habitats. There are other ways to control mink, which are a problem. Setting hounds after them is neither efficient nor helpful to other species.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to carted deer hunting. After a year long review by the Heritage Council and advice from the Attorney General, the Minister has still not said whether the deer hunted by the Ward Union are domestic or wild and she continues to grant a licence for that hunt. Apart from the very repugnant nature of hunting carted deer where, effectively, a domesticated animal is released from the back of a horse box and pursued within an inch of its life, this activity belongs to a past age. It is a relic of a far more cruel and feudal hierarchical society when not only was cruelty inflicted on animals part of normal life but the local squire was in the habit following his hounds in and out of people's gardens, crops and livestock even when lambing was taking place. I do not believe the Minister wants to, or has the right to, endorse that type of behaviour in a country which is under pressure from an agricultural point of view. Many farmers are under considerable pressure without having the added burden of that type of activity taking place on their lands. I ask the Minister to consider carefully her responsibility for that activity.</P>
    <P>The more general area of protecting habitats is the important focus of the Bill. The national heritage areas are an improvement on the areas of scientific interest which they replaced from the point of view of legal protection. However, with national heritage areas covering about 7% of land area &ndash; there are about 1,200 of them &ndash; it is not possible in law for the Minister to say to someone to restore a destroyed area. I do not believe that is a valid response to the crime of the destruction of an NHA. It seems to be accepted as possible, but I have my doubts. NHA protection relies on court injunctions and in the time between the damage being done and the court injunction, more damage is, unfortunately, done.</P>
    <P>When it comes to designating NHAs, I recommend that the Minister and her Department look again at the need to have a wildlife equivalent of An Bord Pleanála &ndash; some type of appeals structure which would ensure there is a possibility for the issue to be addressed independently. I am afraid that does not happen at the moment. Too many other considerations are taken into account in regard to the conditional protection of wildlife. <Col N="1098" /> That is not what the Bill sets out to do or what the EU will tolerate. If compensation is paid to landowners, it should be conditional on agreeing a conservation management plan because that site is part of the nation's heritage as well as private property. The Minister has a responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the fines of £50,000 or two years imprisonment for damaging a NHA, I wonder, slightly tongue-in-cheek, if the Minister might find herself facing such a sanction, particularly following the long drawn out episode at the Glen of the Downs. That will have to wait for the courts and I do not want to impinge on those proceedings.</P>
    <P>Hedgerows were mentioned by various Members who spoke loosely around the subject. The comments I heard showed a lack of a certain amount of information. There is an obvious need to protect hedgerows and we should continue to encourage more people to plant and lay hedges. In some cases, 1 April is far too late because people cut hedges right up to that date. In terms of heavy machinery, they should stop cutting hedges on 1 March in some cases. There is a need for regional and geographic differences. Hedge laying is a far more benign and less intrusive activity than a tractor with a flayer on the back cutting everything in its path. I hope a distinction can be made between the activity of hedge laying and using hand tools on hedges and that a certain amount of time will be allowed between April and September which the Bill proposes. We should not equate that benign and far less intrusive activity with general flaying using heavy machinery. There should be a distinction in the Bill because at the moment there is a blanket ban from 1 April to 1 September which is better than it was but it does not allow for the different factors.</P>
    <P>Vegetation in hedges does not seem to be protected during those times. That is as important a part of a hedge from a wildlife point of view as the hedge itself. I argue that we should do away with that loophole in the protection of our hedges which are one of the last wildlife corridors in the country given the considerable lack of afforestation, particularly deciduous afforestation. Perhaps that is an issue for another Department but it impinges on the Minister and her responsibilities as well.</P>
    <P>The issue of badgers, which is often referred to at Question Time with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has come up in this Bill, and rightly so. The badger deserves the protection of the Minister, particularly when one considers that over 25,000 badgers have been slaughtered under the TB eradication programme and 86% were perfectly healthy. It seems the badger is being made a scapegoat of the worst order. The real offenders are successive Governments which decided to let the badger take the blame for TB without focusing on other issues, such as the movement of cattle and other factors.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Environment and Local Government, is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs to finalise the details of the scheme for the issuing of working visas and authorisations which will allow non-European Economic Area nationals with skills as ICT professionals or technicians, registered nurses or building professionals to come to work here, on foot of an offer of a job from an Irish employer.</P>
      <P>These visas and authorisations will be provided to the non-national at the relevant Irish embassy or consulate abroad. No quotas have been established as to either skills or nationality at this stage but this will be subject to review in the light of experience. The visas will be valid for a period of two years and will be renewable after that period.</P>
      <P>At present non-visa country immigrants can be joined by their spouses and dependants once they can show they are in employment. Visa country immigrants must be in Ireland for one year and have a further year's contract of employment before they can be joined by their spouses and dependants. This approach is compatible with the European Commission's draft directive on family reunification which permits member states to set a qualifying period not to exceed one year before family reunification. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently reviewing these arrangements as they will apply to holders of working visas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that despite the announcement and her statements in the newspaper to the effect that the new scheme was <Col N="1100" /> in force from the day it was announced, no information has yet gone to embassies indicating how people can get a working visa which heretofore they were not able to get? Have the embassies received any information, given that it is now a few months since the announcement was made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement was made a month ago. The Department of Foreign Affairs is in the process, if it has not finalised matters, of getting the stamps which will be put on passports abroad. Such logistical arrangements are being put in place.</P>
      <P>A number of people have come to Ireland since the Government decision was made, most recently a number of nurses from the Philippines. They are currently training in Ireland with a view to taking up employment here. I am fairly certain that by the summer of this year a substantial number of people in the IT area, nursing and building professionals will be availing of these visas. During my visit to India last week a number of inquiries were made to our embassy there and it is giving out information. The person has to find an Irish employer to give him or her a job. At present a number of employment agencies are in the process of identifying persons abroad with a view to offering them employment in Ireland and making an application for a working visa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification. My understanding is that under this new scheme people living in foreign countries can go to the Irish embassy and say they are IT or nursing specialists and want to work in Ireland, and they do not have to be connected with an employer on this side before they get visas to come here and look for jobs. Could the Minister clarify exactly how the process will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen is wrong. They must have an employer. Clearly it would not be desirable, nor do we wish to have a situation where the Irish Ambassador or the Irish Consul, the Honorary Consul in some cases, would have to make a decision about whether a person had the appropriate qualifications. An employer will offer a job to a person from abroad. He or she will go to the embassy and be offered a working visa. If such a person does not have an offer of employment in Ireland, he or she will not get a working visa to come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not the current position? What is new about the scheme which was announced a month ago? Currently, as I understand it, employers or their agents are abroad in Latvia and various other places looking for suitable employees. They tell them there is a job available and then they go and get their visas. What is different about this? The announcement gave the impression that this was a new system whereby some of the skill and labour shortages were to be filled by quotas. Will the Minister confirm also that a person who comes here with a <Col N="1101" /> two year visa can renew that visa? For how long can it be renewed? If that person is here for one year, can their family come to join them or only their spouse? Why is the Minister operating those rules when those are the rules set down for people coming to live here permanently? There is no guarantee that these people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have working visas at present. We are introducing them now. A person can get a working visa abroad. When that person comes to Ireland and takes up employment, he or she can move from one employer to another. At present an employer makes an application and has to prove to the satisfaction of the deciding officer in the Department that he or she cannot find an Irish person or an EEA person who is qualified to do the job before being granted the permit. When the permit is granted the employee cannot move to other employment but can work only for the employer to whom the permit was granted. It is a process that obviously takes some time because of the proofs and so on that are required. Here, all that is required is for an employer, or in the case of an employment agency working on behalf of an employer, to identify people overseas who have particular skills, offer them employment and a letter to that effect and a visa will be issued.</P>
      <P>In relation to their families, at present a person coming from a non-visa country can bring his or her spouse and family to Ireland. This procedure has been in place for some time and is similar to the procedure in the UK because of the common travel area. Others coming from visa countries cannot do so for a year. That is in line with most other European countries.</P>
      <P>We have not made a final decision on when spouses and children can come. We are in discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I would like to be able to facilitate people who come to the country and I would like them to be able to bring their families. Provided they are in good employment and can provide for their families, it is desirable that their families should be with them, if that is what they wish.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if she has completed her consideration of the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group of its examination of the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry; when she expects to bring forward proposals arising from the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. The recommendations referred to the review group concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers; an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares; and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
      <P>I have recently received the report and recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. The review group has reported on this and a wide range of merger and competition law matters. I will publish the report shortly. I apologise to the House because I had promised publication before now. However, the final logistical proof-read copy arrived in the Department only last week and it is currently being printed. I hope to have it published in the next couple of days.</P>
      <P>The review group took more than three years to complete its consideration of the many complex issues within its remit. Clearly, I will require some further time to give the recommendations the full and careful consideration they deserve. I will decide what consequential action, if any, is required in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the media industry is not like any other, that it is not like making cement or telephone components, and that, in terms of the health of our democracy, it is undesirable that there should be a dominant position to the extent that there is, not just in this jurisdiction and on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had strong views about competition because it delivers a better quality of service and better value to consumers generally. What Deputy Rabbitte says about the newspaper industry is particularly so because of the role of the media in informing the public. Having a free press is an important pillar of democracy. We do not need to over emphasise what has happened recently to know how important it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission on the newspaper industry made five recommendations that should be taken into account when the Minister is deciding on a merger. It is one of the sectors where a merger <Col N="1103" /> cannot take place within the industry without the approval of the Minister. It is seen as an important policy matter. Those recommendations are with regard to the strength and competitiveness of the indigenous industry in relation to UK titles, the plurality of newspaper ownership, the plurality of titles, the diversity of views in Irish society and the maintenance of cultural diversity. In the new report it makes one further recommendation and says we need to look also at cross-media ownership and interests in making a decision on a merger. That has considerable merit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken a long time to get to the stage we are at in terms of the Minister publishing the report. If it were any other Minister that was seized of the report and did not publish it before Question Time today but waited for a quiet week, I would be raising questions about it but I would not do that when it is the Tanáiste. We have the report after all these years of waiting. If, as the Minister suggested, amending legislation or other actions are necessary, will she inform the House when she might be ready to take those actions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as some of the recommendations in the review group's report are concerned it will be more an administrative or regulatory change that does not require amending primary legislation. However, much of it requires amending competition law and so on. I hope that during the summer we will be in a position to begin drafting legislation in this area. Legislation is already planned. When the report is published and when we get the copies from the printers I will ensure Opposition spokespersons have a copy of it. It is a very long report and will take a considerable time to read. I hope we will be in a position to make decisions on the findings by the summer of this year.</P>

      <P>Since the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 the authorised staff complement in the Competition Authority has increased from 17 to 24 comprising one full time chairman, four full time members, seven professional staff &ndash; two legal advisers and five economists &ndash; and 12 clerical-administrative staff. <Col N="1104" /> Over the past 12 months, the chairman and one member of the authority together with six professional staff &ndash; two legal advisers and four economists &ndash; resigned to take up alternative employment.</P>
      <P>There are two economists employed in the authority at present, one of whom commenced in August and the other in November last. A legal adviser is employed on a contract basis. Competitions are currently under way under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission to fill the professional posts. The conditions for these posts have been improved by offering permanent positions for both economists and legal advisers and a higher salary range in the case of the legal adviser. Of the three serving members of the authority, one is an economist who is widely regarded as a leading authority on competition matters, another has extensive experience in business and the third has extensive experience in administration, particularly in matters of commercial law.</P>
      <P>As previously announced, Dr. John Fingleton, a highly respected economist who has specialised in competition matters, will take up appointment as chairman of the authority next month, on 3 May I understand. Dr. Paul Gorecki, who is also an economist with experience both in the academic world and in enforcing competition law will take up appointment as a member of the authority in June. Both are being appointed for the maximum period of five years.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that, within a very short time, the chair, a member and six professional staff left the Competition Authority? Does that not tell her something about the resources that are available to it? Is she aware that if proper resources were given to the authority it could add 1% to our GNP by investigating and rooting out cartels and getting rid of anti-competitive practices? Will she confirm the current position is that the two economists who are available to the Competition Authority have between them a total of 12 months' experience? One has eight months' experience in the Competition Authority and the other has four months' experience. What will the Minister do to make the resources available to the authority to allow it do its work? When will an enforcement officer be appointed in light of the fact that Mr. Massey now has to write letters stating that at the present time the authority is not in a position to pursue the matter due to lack of resources? The letter I received was in reply to a query on co-operative creameries and was dated 14 April, 2000.

      <P>That has been an issue. We received Department of Finance sanction recently to increase the salary level and make the staff permanent. I am having an examination to see what further resources the authority needs. The director of enforcement did a terrific job. He informed me in writing the morning after he was informed he was not becoming chairman of the authority that he wished to stand down as enforcement officer. I have not been in a position to assign that office to anyone yet. I want to talk to the chairman when he takes up office next week before doing so. The review group recommended that the enforcement officer should not be a member of the authority but rather a staff member working to the authority and we need to consider whether we should move in that direction which may be desirable. They feel one is involved in the &ldquo;poacher cum gamekeeper&rdquo; scenario which puts an enforcement officer in a difficult position. I am concerned at what is being said. Everyone here knows I am committed to competition and ensuring the enforcement powers given to the authority under the 1996 Act can be executed effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, became law on 1 April 2000. It applies, with some exceptions, to the generality of employees whether they be full-time, part-time, temporary or casual workers. The national minimum hourly rate of pay is £4.40, which sum must be paid by way of a minimum hourly average rate of pay to all experienced adult employees. Hourly rates of pay of lesser amounts than £4.40 may be paid to certain categories of employee &ndash; for instance, to persons under the age of 18, to first time job entrants or to those engaged in training or study.</P>
      <P>It is estimated &ndash; source: ESRI impact study on the national minimum wage &ndash; that the number of employees who will materially benefit immediately from operation of the national minimum wage is 163,000. The average minimum hourly rate of pay must be paid to employees over specific reference periods which may be of a duration of one week, a fortnight or a month. The choice of selection of the reference period to apply to any individual employee is a matter for that individual's employer to exercise. In view of the range of reference periods involved, the longest being of one month's duration, it is not possible at this early stage in the operation of the Act to say whether all employees who stand to gain from the national minimum wage have benefited from it as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By Government decision of last December an additional seven inspectors were authorised for allocation to the labour inspectorate of my Department for the purposes of enforcing the national minimum wage. Such allocation brings <Col N="1107" /> the numerical strength of the inspectorate to 17. The internal departmental process to select the additional inspectors was completed last month and the resulting appointments were finalised earlier this week. All 17 inspectors will be engaged in national minimum wage enforcement activity and in the enforcement of employment legislation generally. In their conduct of this work they will have available to them wide ranging powers of inspection which are laid down in the Act itself and in a variety of other labour law statutes. The conditions of employment attaching to the position of labour inspector render the individual inspector liable for out of normal office hours work, including night work. It is intended that some of the investigative/inspection duties to be performed by the inspectors in respect of both the national minimum wage and other labour legislation will be carried out at night-time.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed inspectors are undergoing training in the various aspects of their duties and activities. A particular focus of that training is the national minimum wage related dimensions of their work. The established inspectors, too, are receiving national minimum wage related training. It is intended to implement, following completion of the initial training programme, a targeted enforcement exercise in respect of the national minimum wage; plans for this exercise are being prepared with a view to implementation in early course.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In the meantime, however, the inspectors are, in the course of their normal inspection duties, checking on the compliance of employers with their responsibilities under the National Minimum Wage Act. Such checks, at this initial post-introduction phase of the operation of the Act, are designed primarily to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; employers in their new obligations and to render all possible assistance in sorting out misunderstandings and &ldquo;teething&rdquo; difficulties which arise in individual places of employment. Some minor irregularities have been detected but no cases of flagrant violations of the Act have yet been encountered.</P>
    <P>As part of the general national minimum wage information campaign additional dedicated telephone lines have been installed to complement and extend the service provided to the public by the information unit of the employment rights division of my Department. Staff in other sections of the Department have also been drafted to assist in dealing with the additional phone inquiries arising. In the first two weeks of April over 7,000 calls of inquiry in relation to the national minimum wage were handled through these arrangements during which time the telephone information service was available to the public up to 9 p.m. on weekdays and also on Saturday, 1 April, the day of launch of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act provides two alternative avenues for redress action for the resolution of disputes between employers and employees with regard to <Col N="1108" /> entitlements under the Act. One such avenue is <i>via</i> the Rights Commissioner Service; the alternative course is to request investigation of the dispute by an inspector. No such request has been received to date.</P>

      <P>When will those extra inspectors begin to carry out inspections? What is the duration of the training in which they are currently engaged? When exactly will they take up their job? I understand the recent radio advertisements were successful. Will the Minister consider a revised radio advertisement concerning part-time workers' rights? Given that many students may have worked during previous summers there is a lack of clarity about their rights. I suggest the Minister put on an advertisement in May indicating to employers the position about part-time workers who will take up summer jobs and the rate per hour. How many inspections will the 17 inspectors carry out per year given that they will have to cover the whole panoply of labour law? How many visits per year or, even per two years, can an employer who is paying the minimum wage expect? Is it the case that they could fall behind and not be found out?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's first question was when all the inspectors would be out doing the job. I expect that to be in a matter of weeks but I will get precise facts for her. Their work will be in the educating side and will involve informing employers and employees of their responsibilities and entitlements. Much of the current work is to clear up some misunderstandings. In regard to part-time workers, on which there is a question on the Order Paper for today, I shall consider getting information into the public domain. There are issues which need to be addressed arising from legislation introduced by the previous Government but it is our responsibility to implement it.</P>
      <P>In the first two weeks of April over 7,000 calls of inquiry in relation to the national minimum wage were handled through the arrangements in place &ndash; which worked reasonably well &ndash; during which time the telephone information service was available to the public up to 9 p.m. on weekdays and also on Saturday, 1 April. On the question of the specific number of visits, the inspectors will implement this legislation. Much of their work will be concentrated on various sectors. While I will ensure the maximum number of inspections take place, I cannot give a precise figure. I can provide the figures for the number of inspections taking place if the Deputy wishes to table a further question. In regard to part-time workers they have pursued particular sectors and have got good results.</P>

      <P>In deciding to establish the review group on auditing, I positively responded to the recommendation in the Committee of Public Accounts' DIRT inquiry report which proposed that a number of areas of possible reform in the auditing profession should be examined. In doing so, I took the opportunity to expand the recommended terms of reference to include the subject of self-regulation within the review group's remit. I have asked the group to report to me by 31 May next, and I hope that it will be able to conclude its deliberations on all of these issues around that time.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree there has been almost no scandal since Goodman right up to the matters that dominate the newspapers today where the focus is not surprisingly on politicians? There has not been any scandal since Goodman in which the role of auditors is not a cause for grave concern. In the case of Goodman, for example, a company that was found to have a £550 million deficiency had had its accounts signed off without any note a few months earlier. Is this not a cause for serious concern about accounting practices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with what the Deputy has said. It is astonishing that so many of the matters that have come into the public domain through tribunals or inquiries were matters audited by members of the accounting bodies. It seems to me that some people think the audit is in the interests of the management rather than the shareholders and the public generally. Auditors have enormous responsibilities. It is a self-regulated profession. I favour the concept of self-regulation but if it does not work and professional bodies do not take action to discipline those members who have been involved in serious wrong-doing we will have no alternative but to go down the legislative route. We cannot have a situation where time and again accounts are audited which are totally and utterly inaccurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this review group examine the situation that might arise when companies change their auditors? Does this create an opportunity for a cartel to operate with three or four large accountancy companies moving from business to business? Accountants who offer auditing facilities are concerned that this may be the result. Can the Minister ensure that the review group looks at the implications of its decisions on the relative advantages of a large company over a small one?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always easy to take on the &ldquo;small guy&rdquo;. The larger players are often much more significant and we must take them on with the same vigour.</P>
      <P>I am told that the audit is regarded as a loss leader by accountancy firms and is often done in the interest of gaining subsequent consultancy work. The Public Accounts Committee report unravelled a great deal in this area. We must try to separate auditing from the much more lucrative consultancy work. The issues raised by Deputy Owen will be considered by the review group. The Deputies opposite are free to make a submission to the review group if they wish.</P>
      <P>The group, which is chaired by Senator O'Toole, is working extremely hard. It meets very early in the morning every second week and has also broken into small sub-committees. I invite Members to put submissions before the review group before it concludes its work at the end of May.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The grocery industry is an important part of the Irish economy, both through its direct contribution to GDP and employment and through its linkages with other sectors of the economy. The AC Nielsen, Retail Census 1998 showed that there were over 9,000 retail grocery outlets in Ireland of which multiples accounted for 157, symbol groups 1,152, and independents 7,872.</P>
      <P>The industry is seen as attractive, as evidenced by the increase in the number of international retailers entering the market and levels of investment by existing enterprises. The CSO household budget survey shows that average weekly household expenditure on food increased by 25.8% between 1987 and 1994-5. This increase in average expenditure, combined with the impact of rapidly increasing employment levels in the economy and new household formation, suggests the industry will continue to expand.</P>
      <P>Irish consumers have benefited significantly from changes under way in the industry in recent years as retailers have invested in innovative formats, wider product ranges and improved customer services. Consumers are likely to continue to benefit further from sustained competition and the internationalisation of the grocery and wider retail markets. Maintenance of a strong, competitive retail market will be to the ultimate benefit of Irish consumers and will contribute to the overall competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the 1987 Groceries Order has helped the massive <Col N="1112" /> investment by the grocery industry since then? Does she agree that the grocery market includes the supply of grocery shops? Is she aware of the report carried out on the distributive trades which are closely linked to the grocery market? Does she agree that grocery prices have not increased, due to the retention of the order which has allowed sustained massive investment in the trade? As there are now 9,000 grocery retailers, the industry has farreaching effects.</P>

      <P>A number of grocery retailers have been put out of business. It is interesting that the meat and fruit and vegetable sectors which are not covered by the groceries order declined to a lesser extent than the area covered by it. Competition, not just in the country but also within specific areas, is important. The retail sector has a localised market. I am concerned that consumers get good value for money.</P>

      <P>In view of the question's mention of the vibrancy and health of the grocery industry, does the Tánaiste have a view on the future vibrancy and health of the industry if no limit is placed on the floor area of very large grocery outlets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Placing a physical limit on the floor area of grocery outlets may not be as important as limiting the market share of one large player or a small number of large players who might collaborate and use their dominant position to abuse both consumers and suppliers. We must use whatever mechanism is necessary to do that. This is one of the issues I wish to examine and I have written to Deputies in response to a letter about the groceries order to say that we must look at this issue before we contemplate making changes. Small suppliers as well as consumers can be very vulnerable when there are only one or two large players. Such an environment would not be in anyone's interest. We need competition. We must ensure that suppliers are not exploited and that there is easy access for consumers to retail units. People should not have to travel long distances to get their basic household products.</P>
      <P>When the report is published next week I will consult with the various groups which have an interest in this area before coming to any conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 28 March 2000 on a range of measures to address Ireland's skill requirements &ndash;  realising the potential of the Irish labour market, investment in people and retraining and proactive promotion of skill requirements in the EEA, EU applicant countries and globally.</P>
      <P>The Government also decided that a working visa system be introduced in respect of information and communication technologies, nursing skills and building professionals which are in short supply in Ireland. The working visa system does not envisage quotas for particular countries or skills but the system will be informed by the realities of the labour market. As part of that process the social partners have been, and will be, consulted in the development and adjustment of immigration policy.</P>
      <P>For the designated sectors the working visa system will permit applicants to apply abroad to an Irish embassy or consulate for a single working visa or authorisation if coming from a country where visas are not required for entry. The application will have to be supported by a job offer. Working visas or authorisations issued by embassies and consulates abroad will be valid for two years and permit multiple re-entry on the part of the holder. Visas or authorisations may be renewed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Nurses from certain countries may be required to undergo a period of supervised clinical practice in an Irish teaching hospital before they will be eligible for full registration with An Bord Altranais. Having obtained full registration with An Bord Altranais, on satisfactory completion of the period of supervised practice, such nurses will be issued with a further working visa or authorisation permitting them to work for a further 21 months. Such visas are renewable at two year intervals thereafter in the normal manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Tánaiste to say that someone in a country which requires a visa must find an employer in this country? How can a nurse living in a remote part of the Philippines, which is made up of 7,000 islands, and who wishes to come and work in Ireland, find out that St. Vincent's Hospital, for example, needs his or her skills. What safeguards are in place to prevent people who are granted work permits because of the particular skills they possess immediately taking up jobs in another sector? What is to stop a person leaving nursing to work for a pharmaceutical company as a sales agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Employers here have to find the person abroad; otherwise, thousands of people would come here without a job. Perhaps ambassadors and honorary consuls would be expected to <Col N="1114" /> make decisions on whether the qualifications held were appropriate. That would be an impossible task. We considered every possible option, including that scenario, and what happens in other countries. I do not think there will be a problem. For example, the 200 nurses from the Philippines were recruited by a nurse recruitment agency. That will happen in other sectors also. There is no way a person who comes here on a working visa can be compelled to stay with the company from which he or she received the initial job offer.</P>

In his analysis for Forfás, Paul Tansey said that to implement the plan an additional 200,000 people will be needed over and above the number who will join the labour force domestically. He envisages that perhaps half will be returned emigrants. We will also risk losing some mobile investment. In discussing possible expansion with some of the big FDI investors their biggest concern is whether they will able to meet their staffing requirements. If we had not done something like this we would have put some of that investment at risk and limited the potential for expansion. A balance is required. That scenario would have been worse economically than the decision we have taken.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste consider a trade show for the recruitment of non-nationals? I know of a company in Sligo which has submitted 19 applications for processing at a cost of £125 per application. From the date of application it is taking eight or nine weeks to receive a reply because of the red tape involved. This is too long. Given the huge skills shortage will the Department consider matching employers with non-nationals? This would enable applications to be processed more quickly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> I have recently received the report and recommendations of the competition and mergers review group established by my predecessor in 1996. The review group's terms of reference covered a wide range of issues concerning merger and competition law, including the groceries order. Among the many submissions received by the review group on the groceries order was one from the Competition Authority. The authority is of the view that the order should be repealed.</P>
    <P>The review group required over three years to examine the wide range of complex issues encompassed by its remit. Clearly I will require some further time to give its extensive report the consideration it deserves. In the interim I intend to publish the report and to meet post-Easter a number of groups, including IBEC, the IFA, independent retailers and a host of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Tánaiste expect to make a decision on the groceries order and the ban on below cost selling in particular? Are we talking about one month or six months? The economic case for maintaining the ban is well made. I therefore draw the Tánaiste's attention to the social dimension. In reply to Question No. 6 she indicated that there are 9,000 retail outlets. In the United Kingdom 40% of small towns and villages have no retail food outlet. This is something of which we should be acutely conscious. Many of the 9,000 retail outlets are located in rural Ireland. If the ban on below cost selling is removed there is a danger the large multiples will gain at the expense of small shops in towns and villages which provide an excellent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the issues of concern. There is no point having massive competition for a couple of months followed by very little. That would be most damaging to consumers. I will also have to look at inflationary pressures in the economy and consider what the Competition Authority and the review group have to say. There are different perspectives but all the matters raised by the Deputy and others will be considered. The decision will not be made before the summer.</P>

      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that the order has not acted as a disincentive in attracting large multiples to the Irish market? Competition is welcomed by all those involved in the trade. Is the Tánaiste aware that the multiples have not sought the removal of the order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>One should not just respond to those with a particular vested interest. We have to look at the wider national issues, particularly the impact on consumers and suppliers. Whether a particular vested interest lobbies is not the issue. The competition and mergers review group did not recommend getting rid of the order which bans the payment of hello money which it states should remain. It also requires multiples to publicly display interest or payment terms. The only aspect they said should go, was below cost selling about which people are concerned. Before we come to any conclusions we need to be well informed of all the consequences. I welcome some of the new companies which have come into the market. It will be good for consumers and suppliers.</P>

The victims were the small villages and towns south of the Border where the fabric of the rural economy was devastated. Does she agree that at a time when some commercial vibrancy has returned to those towns, villages and rural areas, commerce and trade should be protected in the long-term against multinational players with huge resources at their disposal? </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of draft EU directives have implications for the growth of the information society and Internet trading. The directives cover the following areas: consumer protection, financial services, intellectual property and the Internal Market of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The draft directive of most direct relevance to the development of Internet trading in Europe and for which our Department has responsibility is the Draft E-Commerce Directive. This is an Internal Market directive draft and confirms the freedom to trade information society services across EU borders. This legislation is designed to encourage and promote e-commerce and I am satisfied it will have the effect of promoting a strong Internet economy in Europe. Ireland strongly supported this directive and sought to ensure that it would create an open, liberal and regulatory environment for Internet trading. The draft directive is due to become law in June this year.</P>
      <P>Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the Internal Market for information society services. When enacted, the Electronic Commerce Bill, which passed all Stages in the Seanad yesterday, will position Ireland as the first country in Europe to recognise in a comprehensive manner electronic contracts, electronic writing and electronic signatures. In almost all areas of business and public administration we are creating a legal equivalence between the paper world and the electronic world. This will enable Irish business to cut the cost and time taken to carry out business transactions. Businesses will now be able to sign contracts and carry out on-line business in a legally secure environment. The benefits to enterprises of embracing e-business are estimated to bring considerable savings. For example, the construction industry's Build-Online site is estimated to save Irish firms up to £1 billion per year over the cost of the traditional paper based way of doing business.</P>

Directives 97/7/EC on the protection of consumers in <Col N="1121" /> respect of distance contracts for goods and services and the proposed financial services directive, when adopted, will provide a significant boost for e-commerce in the EU by laying down a framework which will have the confidence of consumers.</P>

We are applying ourselves to issues such as the protection of names and hope to address it in subsequent legislation.</P>

The area of drop charges may need regu<Col N="1122" /> lation.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, came into operation on 2 January 1997. The Act is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person's education at risk. It sets minimum age limits for the employment of children, namely, those under the age of 16, and young persons, 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours and prohibits the employment of under-18s on late night work. Employers must keep specified records of their workers who are under 18.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of the Act rests with the labour inspectorate of my Department. I am satisfied that the inspectorate has been acting with all due diligence in its approach to such enforcement. In 1999, a total of 1,114 inspections for conformity with the Act were carried out, arising from which 14 cases of non-compliance have been identified for referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution of the offending employers concerned. I am, however, conscious of ongoing concerns expressed by various interested groups about breaches of the Act and I am especially mindful of the role played by ICTU in drawing attention to the exploitative practices used by less scrupulous employers against young persons in the workplace.</P>
      <P>While all reasonable measures have been taken by the inspectorate to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights/protections of young persons, I am keen that all avenues open to my officials to improve and strengthen the enforcement function are availed of. In this connection I am happy to say that an intensified and targeted enforcement effort will be made in the period immediately ahead through the appropriate deployment of the ten established labour inspectors and seven new additional inspectors who have become available to me earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Out of normal office hours inspection activity is now a regular feature of the working conditions of the labour inspectors. Accordingly, the year 2000 business plan of the labour inspectorate provides specifically for some night work to be carried out to address the alleged incidence of late night working by young persons and other forms of exploitation used against them by employers. Plans to implement this work are being finalised at present.</P>
      <P>As to the monitoring of the operation of the Act, I would point out that a special group which I established for this purpose has presented me with a submission containing ideas and advice for an enhanced enforcement and operation of the Act. Aspects of this submission are at present being assessed as to their legal propriety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that there is no point in having legislation on the Statute Book if it is not enforced? Did I mishear him when he said he has one inspector looking <Col N="1124" /> after this area? With regard to late night working, does he recall the recent revelation that inspectors, if they are plural, go home at 5 p.m.? There is not much point in having legislation which provides against children working late at night during the school term if the inspectors go home at 5 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 17 inspectors, all of whom are involved in this work and that regarding the minimum wage. We discussed this issue previously and discussions took place with relevant unions. The inspectors can now work out of normal office hours which, effectively, is at night. There have been many complaints from teachers, parents and unions and we need more activity and more inspections. If parents, teachers and others are aware of specific cases, they should be inspected at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the terms of employment for the seven new inspectors? Have they all been employed on the basis that they will have to work at night and work shift hours? Are the 17 inspectors who were eulogised as looking after the minimum wage the same inspectors who look after this legislation, JLCs, the construction industry and health and safety? Will the Minister of State take on board the suggestion I made to the Minister that a new advertising campaign about part-time workers and the minimum wage should also include information on the employment rights of young persons? There is a real opportunity for the exploitation of young people and teachers speak of pupils falling asleep at their desks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former teacher I have much contact with the teaching profession and I am conscious of their concerns and those of their unions. I share the Deputy's concerns about this issue. The inspectors are the same 17 who ensure that the minimum wage legislation is being implemented. However, we must consider the practicalities of the situation. By going to the workplace it is possible to check if Acts are being implemented. I do not see a major problem there. The new arrangements are to allow for night inspections.</P>

      <P>The Government decided last year to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function, including the assimilation of the LES under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FÁS employment service. The Government also decided on the establishment of an employment service advisory committee within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the local employment service.</P>
      <P>This integration between the FÁS employment service and the LES, apart from having been advocated in various evaluation reports in recent years, has been endorsed in the current new social partnership agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS has recently commenced a consultation process with the partnerships to identify the most <Col N="1126" /> appropriate arrangements for different areas, having due regard to their distinctive local characteristics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be well informed. I want to have the new criteria endorsed by the social partners and I am looking forward to their comments. I want flexibility, so that when somebody comes to the end of his or her three years, he or she will not go from a job initiative programme to nothing. That requires flexibility to be given to somebody to make the decision, which I propose giving to the LES. If an individual completes his or her three years on a job initiative and is not is a position to move into a regular labour market job or to get involved in a training programme, he or she will stay, subject to the endorsement of the LES, in job initiative or the social economy or whatever. That is the best outcome to the kind of uncertainties and difficulties that have arisen. That core group of people deserve flexibility and special arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to put into the public domain her comprehensive conclusions on this matter? Is she providing any distinctive validating mechanism for those employed in social economy units, as distinct from more typical, run of the mill job initiative posts? Has she had any success in her discussions with the Minister for Education and Science on whether that Department, for example, might make a contribution towards the maintenance of employment in schools and so on, such as caretakers and class assistants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, it would be desirable, particularly in the context of the buoyancy of the economy, if the line Departments were to take responsibility for the areas of social employment that fall within their remit. A high proportion of them are caretakers, teaching assistants and secretaries. It is not satisfactory that it is a stop-start situation, where schools do not know from one year to the next if they will have somebody. I hope that will be taken on board very quickly by the Department of Education and Science. It is obviously a resource issue which must be resolved. We also need to resolve aspects of this with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to those on environmental projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put my comments into the public domain. Although I am asking the social partners for their <Col N="1127" /> views, I am quite happy to let Deputies Rabbitte and Owen have copies also for their comments in relation to the position on the jobs initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that school secretaries and caretakers in the social economy/CE situation are being laid off as we speak because the dovetailing between the two Departments has not worked properly? The £30 million in relation to the Department of Education and Science is not in the system yet. Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, instruct FÁS agents around the country not to end school caretaking and secretary schemes until the education one has come into force?</P>
      <P>Has any decision been made by the group looking at the social economy, to which the Minister referred, to look at the sectors that need social economy workers rather than just the geographical areas? My fear is that five or ten areas throughout the country will be deemed eligible for social employment and other areas that have social employment needs, albeit not the most deprived areas, will not gain and that handicapped or sick people will lose out. Can that be done on the basis of job specification rather than totally on the basis of geographical areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to community employment, I understand that one is to dovetail with another. I hope that will happen. I will pursue the matter with FÁS, in the light of what Deputy Owen has said, later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that the social economy scheme will be sectoral as much as regional. Obviously, the priority will be the most disadvantaged communities. However, clearly that does not mean it should be exclusively urban or that certain sectors, such as people working with the handicapped, should be excluded. We must cover <Col N="1128" /> both situations if possible. That is the intention of the review group examining this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the plans for Ireland's participation in the EXPO 2000 exposition in Hannover are now well advanced. Indeed, I had the honour to attend a ceremony on Wednesday, 12 April last, to mark the completion of the construction of the Pavilion of Ireland in Hannover.</P>
      <P>EXPO 2000 is the first world exposition of the new millennium and the first world exposition ever to be held in Germany. It will take place in Hannover from 1 June to 31 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Germany is the largest economy in Europe and the third largest economy in the world. Ireland enjoys strong political and commercial ties with that country, as instanced by the fact that Germany is now Ireland's third most important trading partner, our second biggest export market and our third largest source of visitors to Ireland. In 1998, for example, there were 310,000 visits to Ireland by German residents.</P>
      <P>It was in recognition of this that I was pleased to recommend to Government that Ireland should participate in EXPO 2000 and that the Government decided to participate in February 1998. Funding of £9.1 million has been made available for this project, reflecting the considerable importance which the Government attaches to it.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in the World Exposition, EXPO 2000, will take place under the theme &ldquo;Experience Ireland&rdquo; and will be made up of a newly constructed pavilion in the prestigious European Boulevard, the promotion of the widest possible national agenda by the State developmental and promotional agencies and an extensive cultural and events programme throughout the five months duration of EXPO 2000 which will promote Ireland's culture and also assist the State agencies in their task.</P>
      <P>The German authorities have chosen &ldquo;Humankind-Nature-Technology; a New World Arising&rdquo;, as the theme for EXPO 2000, and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; is the strong underlying theme. I commend this thematic choice because it is intended to represent an optimistic statement by the world community, at the start of a new century and the third millennium, that the new technologies can and will be harnessed to serve humankind by means of new innovative strategies which will promote economic and social development while preserving and conserving nature and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> The design of Ireland's pavilion at EXPO 2000 is entirely faithful to the underlying EXPO 2000 theme of sustainability. The Dúl Consortium &ndash; comprising Murray O'Laoire Architects, Orna Hanly Architect, Boyle Design Group, X Communications and Luke Dodd, Curator &ndash; have incorporated the principle of sustainable design in their use of materials and especially by means of the building's thermal management regime, which avoids the use of mechanically-generated energy consumption. The pavilion exhibition, which is being undertaken by Display Contracts International Limited of Dublin, fuses elements of traditional museum display, specially commissioned artwork, state-of-the-art interactive presentations, and special sensory effects to take the visitor on a &ldquo;journey&rdquo; through Ireland from pre-history to the present day.</P>
    <P>As I have already suggested, the location of EXPO 2000 in Germany provides important opportunities for our State promotional and development agencies to promote the widest possible national agenda. Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Bord Fáilte Éireann, Bord Bia, FÁS and IDA Ireland will be promoting Ireland as a location for inward investment, superb and diverse tourist attractions, the sourcing of Irish food and drink products of the highest quality and excellent employment and career possibilities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree when I say that Ireland's national agenda should not be confined to economic and commercial considerations. I am pleased to inform the House that we have organised an extensive cultural and events programme for EXPO 2000 which will promote what Ireland is particularly renowned for &ndash; the innovation, creativity and imagination of our people.</P>
    <P>Some 450 Irish artists, performers, musicians, writers and dancers will gather in Hannover for Ireland's culture and events programme at EXPO 2000. It is not possible for me in the time available to provide the House with full details of the programme, but the highlight will certainly be the performance of a specially commissioned composition of music for percussion and orchestra by the celebrated Irish musician, Donal Lunny. The RTE Concert Orchestra will perform this composition on the occasion of Ireland's National Day at EXPO 2000 on 28 June next in Hannover, and I will have the honour to accompany the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to these national day celebrations.</P>

      <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of industry in rural Ireland. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the regions.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is working closely with the providers of infrastructure and the educational/training bodies, etc., to deliver improved facilities for industry in the regions. The agency is seeking to deliver over 50% of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective One &ndash; Border, midlands and west &ndash; region. This will not diminish efforts to attract high value added projects to the weaker areas of other regions in line with a policy of balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>To ensure that a more equitable distribution of jobs is achieved, IDA reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and the allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its project divisions. Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> In the Objective One regions, IDA has acquired additional land and has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key centres. The approach being pursued by IDA Ireland is having a positive impact on regional development and since January 2000 good progress has been made in locations such as Dundalk, Letterkenny, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Cork, Sligo and Mullingar. Industries locating in regional towns/cities benefit the surrounding rural areas.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also committed to developing indigenous industry and to regional dispersal and this is reflected in the deployment of over 100 staff in its regional network. In addition to working with its core client base, the agency, because of its involvement in all aspects of business development &ndash; finance, technology, human resources etc &ndash; works closely with all development organisations in the region as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region.</P>
    <P>Complementary measures in the national development plan will also help to underpin the development agencies regional strategy since it will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will further advance economic development in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 42, 65 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, became law on 1 April 2000. It applies, with some exceptions, to the generality of employees whether they be full-time, part-time, temporary or casual workers. The national minimum hourly rate of pay is £4.40, which sum must be paid, by way of a minimum hourly average rate of pay, to all experienced adult employees. Hourly rates of pay of lesser amounts than £4.40 may be paid to certain categories of employee as, for instance, to persons under the age of 18, to first time job entrants or to those engaged in training or study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated &ndash; source: ESRI impact study on the National Minimum Wage that the number of employees who will materially benefit immediately from operation of the National Minimum Wage is 163,000. The average minimum hourly <Col N="1135" /> rate of pay must be paid to employees over specific reference periods which may be of durations of one week, a fortnight or a month. The choice of selection of the reference period to apply to any individual employee is a matter for that individual's employer to exercise. In view of the range of reference periods involved, the longest being of one month's duration, it is not possible at this early stage in the operation of the Act to say whether all employees who stand to gain from the NMW have in fact benefited from it as yet.</P>
    <P>By Government decision of last December an additional seven inspectors were authorised for allocation to the labour inspectorate of my Department for purposes of enforcing the National Minimum Wage. Such allocation brings the numerical strength of the inspectorate to 17. The internal departmental process to select the additional inspectors was completed last month and the resulting appointments were finalised earlier this week. All 17 inspectors will be engaged in the National Minimum Wage enforcement activity and in the enforcement of employment legislation generally. In their conduct of this work they will have available to them wide ranging powers of inspection which are laid down in the National Minimum Wage Act itself and in a variety of other labour law statutes. The conditions of employment attaching to the position of labour inspector render the individual inspector liable for out of normal office hours work including night work. It is intended that some of the investigative-inspection duties to be performed by the inspectors in respect of both the NMW and other labour legislation will be carried out at night time.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed inspectors are at present undergoing training in the various aspects of their duties and activities. A particular focus of that training is the National Minimum Wage related dimensions of their work. The established inspectors, too, are receiving National Minimum Wage related training. It is intended to implement, following completion of the initial training programme, a targeted enforcement exercise in respect of the National Minimum Wage: plans for this exercise are being prepared at the moment with a view to implementation in early course. In the meantime, however, the inspectors are, in the course of their normal inspection duties, checking on the compliance of employers with their responsibilities under the National Minimum Wage Act. Such checks, at this initial post-introduction phase of the operation of the Act, are designed primarily to educate employers in their new obligations and to render all possible assistance in sorting out misunderstandings and teething difficulties which arise in individual places of employment. Some minor irregularities have been detected but no cases of flagrant violations of the Act have yet been encountered.</P>
    <P>The Act provides two alternative avenues for redress action for the resolution of disputes between employers and employees with regard to <Col N="1136" /> entitlements under the Act. One such avenue is via the Rights Commissioner Service; the alternative course is to request investigation of the dispute by an Inspector. No such request has been received to date.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any lay-offs resulting from the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of the programme is to progress participants into mainstream employment. The first phase of participants have completed their term and are now availing of a six months extension in order to address any training or development needs they may still have, and to allow time for the local employment service to engage more actively with them to facilitate their progression to employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The process of consultation with the social partners and interested parties on the recommendations of the Deloitte and Touche review of job initiative has been delayed while further consideration is being given by my Department to the implications the Redundancy Payments Acts for the operation of the job initiative programme. I expect that consultations can be concluded shortly enabling guidelines to be issued on the future operation of the programme at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four key components in the legislative and regulatory framework proposed to promote the development of electronic commerce and digital industries in Ireland. The range of regulat<Col N="1137" /> ory instruments recognises the need for a multi-disciplinary and connected approach in our drive to promote electronic commerce and the information society. These measures, together with a number of initiatives being taken by our Department and its agencies, are set to give us a leading role in e-commerce and will serve to create a strong Internet economy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The legislative and regulatory instruments cover: framework legislation to give legal certainty to electronic transactions, consumer protection measures, legislation on data protection, and copyright legislation.</P>
      <P>The Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, was published on Thursday 6 April. The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and passed all Stages in the Seanad yesterday, 19 April 2000. The legislation provides for the legal recognition of electronic contracts, electronic writing, electronic signatures and the admissibility of electronic evidence in courts and creates legal equivalence between the paper based world and the electronic world. The Bill is jointly sponsored by the Department of Public Enterprise and our own Department. The legislation will apply to both commercial and non-commercial transactions and will, furthermore, enable government and public administration to deliver its services on-line.</P>
      <P>Additional budgetary implications of the legislation are expected to be minimal and will arise only in the context of publicising the legislation and in bringing forward any upgrading of existing computer systems in public bodies, which would in any event, have been required. Indeed, savings may be envisaged as the legislation coupled with administrative measures being taken in a number of Departments to deliver services on-line, will permit the delivery of services to the citizen and to business in a faster and more cost efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Our Department also has responsibility for consumer protection measures. Consumer confidence is a vital component in the growth of e-commerce. This Government is determined to ensure that consumer protection in the virtual world, will receive no less attention than in the terrestrial world. To that end, supplementary measures are also needed to protect and inform the consumer, who buys goods and services on the Internet. I will be making regulations over the coming months to give effect to the draft EU Directive on E-Commerce and EU Directive 97/7/EC on Distance Selling of Goods and Services (Excluding Financial Services). Financial services is the subject of a separate directive, which is still at working group level in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data protection legislation ensures that information about an individual is handled properly and responsibly and recognises that there are privacy issues which arise from the vast amount of information kept on computer information systems about individuals. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Our existing law, the <Col N="1138" /> Data Protection Act, 1988, provides for the operation of a data protection regime to international standards. This legislation will be amended to comply with Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, which will ensure that information about individuals is further protected while allowing the effective discharge of business and other activities. Work on the draft Bill is well advanced and it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>Our Department has responsibility for copyright protection also. The Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, has just been concluded at Committee Stage of the Dáil Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. One of the main objectives of this Bill is the putting in place of a modern effective, efficient regime for the protection of copyright and related rights. Recognising the economic and cultural significance of copyright theft, in the context of e-commerce and the information society, this Bill provides for civil remedies and criminal penalties, sufficient to deter such theft.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides copyright rightsholders with rights and remedies against persons who unlawfully circumvent technological protection measures, designed to protect certain copyright materials, for example, producers of &ldquo;smart cards&rdquo; for tapping into encrypted satellite broadcasts and persons who remove rights management information such as &ldquo;digital fingerprints&rdquo; from copyright materials. Also in relation to the Internet, there are &ldquo;notify and take down&rdquo; provisions whereby if infringing material is being carried on a service i.e., the Internet, and the rights owners inform service providers that infringing material is being carried on their service, the service providers will be obliged to remove that material as soon as is practicable or they will also be liable for that infringement.</P>
    <P>There are some other regulatory and administrative measures which are or will be implemented over a varying timeframe and which are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments. These include the EU Draft Directive on Electronic Money, a Statutory Instrument on Cryptography, on-line registration of companies, revenue on-line service for taxpayers, on-line Land Registry initiatives, etc.</P>

      <P>The report of the commission on the newspaper industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Departments. In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government in relation to any necessary action. One of the recommendations of the commission on the newspaper industry was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry. I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard. I have not had any up to date discussions on this matter with representatives of the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

      <P>The expert group on future skill needs recognised that increasing tightness in the labour market is already inducing many large Irish employers to deliberately seek to recruit older workers. It recommended that employers should actively seek to recruit people in the over 55 group and that people in this age group should be encouraged to seek employment. I support this recommendation. I would also encourage employers to take a proactive approach to the provision of lifelong learning opportunities for older members of their workforce to ensure their continued employability and productivity.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in recruitment and employment on a range of grounds including age, will make a significant contribution to ensuring that older people have equality of access to available job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards assistance to older unemployed per<Col N="1140" /> sons, FÁS works in close co-operation with statutory and voluntary bodies involved in supporting the reintegration of older unemployed people into the labour market. In addition, the process of active engagement with unemployed people under the employment action plan is being progressively rolled out to include older age groups. The intention is that all adults crossing nine months unemployment will be included in the process in the course of the next twelve months. This approach will provide an added impetus to existing FÁS efforts to facilitate the return to the workforce of people over 55.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 48, 58, 69 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>I led the first Irish software trade mission to India, organised by Enterprise Ireland, from 6-13 April last. Representatives from Enterprise Ireland, 11 Irish based software companies and three other organisations accompanied me.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland organised an extensive programme of meetings with potential buyers and business partners for each of the participating Irish companies during visits to New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the mission were: to assist selected information technology and software companies to gain access to the Indian market at the highest levels; to assist these companies to <Col N="1141" /> investigate all elements of the market, including local competition and supporting infrastructure; to investigate the possibilities of developing mutually beneficial partnerships between Indian and Irish companies in the software sector and enable companies in Ireland to access Indian software skills; to promote Ireland as a suitable location for Indian companies to form partnerships with their Irish counterparts; generally to increase awareness of Ireland and in particular Ireland's economic performance in recent years; and to enable Enterprise Ireland to assess the potential for business development between Ireland and India in the software sector and to make decisions on the priority and allocation of resources in this area.</P>
    <P>During my visit the following agreements were concluded. I signed a technology agreement between the Irish and Indian Governments, the terms of which will commit both Governments to examine the possibilities for greater co-operation in the fields of electronics and information technology. The Indian Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Information Technology also signed it. Two Irish technology companies signed significant new agreements with Indian partners. These joint ventures are targeting the domestic Indian market and international markets. A memorandum of understanding was signed by representatives of the Irish Software Association and India's National Association of Software and Services Companies. The MOU will provide a basis for mutual co-operation and information exchange.</P>
    <P>There is major potential for the Irish and <Col N="1142" /> Indian software industries to exploit one another's knowledge and expertise and to extend their market reach. There are many opportunities for Irish companies to supply products to a number of industry sectors in India. Ireland has 600 indigenous software companies with strong creative and innovative flair. Indian business partners could service and supply these products within the massive Indian market.</P>
    <P>Smaller Irish and Indian companies could partner with each other to find staff and support and distribute products within India. Ireland could also act as an entry point for Indian companies which want to expand into Europe.</P>

    <P>It is my policy and that of the Ministers of State at my Department to participate fully in meetings of the European Council of Ministers and every possible effort is made to effect this. There are occasions, however, where attendance is not possible by virtue of illness or previous commitments. In these situations, the rules of procedure of the EU Council allow for members of the council to arrange to be represented.</P>

      <P>The dedicated unit in FÁS set up to assist eligible asylum seekers in gaining employment, including identification of training needs, has come into operation in the last two weeks. This unit is located in Tallaght Enterprise Centre in co-operation with Get Tallaght Working. As part of assisting eligible asylum seekers to obtain employment it is intended to assist them in identifying their individual skills and competencies. The unit is currently receiving relevant data on eligible asylum seekers transferred to it from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. In the first week, ten eligible asylum seekers have been placed in employment, including one civil engin<Col N="1143" /> eer. Staff in the unit are currently undergoing training in the use of the computer systems and in mediation and guidance skills for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Details from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs indicate that there were 2,260 asylum seekers eligible to seek employment at the end of March 2000. Their position at the end of March was as follows: 1,088 are on unemployment assistance; 570 are on supplementary welfare allowance and 524 who may be in employment or have left the country. A further 78 are in receipt of a variety of benefits including, lone parents allowance, disability and vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
      <P>As there is an interval between an employee taking up employment and their records transferring from the Revenue Commissioner to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the latter Departments intend to follow up these 524 clients manually. More precise figures should be available from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the near future.</P>
      <P>FÁS intend to set up a larger unit in Blanchardstown in the near future. This unit will cater for areas such as the Navan Road, inner city and north Kildare where about 50% of eligible asylum seekers are located.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, IDA Ireland introduced Hawkesbay Apparel Limited to the former Fruit of the Loom facility in Raphoe, County Donegal. This introduction was on the basis that Hawkesbay would create a minimum of 150 jobs in the facility. The company's business plan was based on a project to produce a range of clothing for fashion designer branded companies, and department and chain stores. The project was totally independent of Hawkesbay's existing business in Ireland of producing jeans under contract for VF Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> The Raphoe factory was still in the ownership of Fruit of the Loom and, within the context of its grant liabilities to IDA, Fruit of the Loom was obliged to secure IDA approval for any sale of the facility. No grant aid was involved in the new project to be based in Raphoe.</P>
    <P>Hawkesbay has now found it cannot deliver on job prospects and has decided to place the Raphoe facility on the market for a much inflated price. However, IDA Ireland is determined to continue its strong marketing efforts and deliver results for the entire county and in this context its preference is that the Raphoe facility remain available for marketing.</P>
    <P>The sale of the former Raphoe facility was an independent third party property transaction between Fruit of the Loom and Hawkesbay, albeit one that required the consent of IDA Ireland. In approving the sale between the third parties, IDA reached agreement with Hawkesbay based on the delivery of specific job numbers within a timeframe. Specifically, if the company did not deliver a minimum of 150 jobs by 31 December 2000, a liability would accrue to IDA of £450,000. IDA is in the process of securing this payment.</P>
    <P>The development agencies are making progress in Donegal as evidenced by the Pacificare project, Prumerica Systems Ireland Limited and an active marketing programme on the Milford facility. IDA has also submitted a planning application for a new healthcare facility for County Donegal. In February 2000, Enterprise Ireland approved assistance to Raphoe Enterprise Company Limited of approximately £62,000 towards the establishment of an enterprise centre. The workspace will be four separate units of 1,l00 square feet each.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a keen interest among Deputies in recent weeks in the status of implementation of EU directives for which my Depart<Col N="1145" /> ment has responsibility and I am anxious to respond in the most expedient way possible. One such way would be to make the information available on the Department's website. This is very <Col N="1146" /> much in line with my commitment to contributing to e-Government and I have asked by Department to look at this with a view to having this on-line as soon as is practically possible.</P>

      <P>The report of the implementation advisory group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector was finalised by the group on 19 May 1999 and submitted to the Tánaiste and to the Minister for Finance on the following day. The report was published on 23 June 1999 in <Col N="1158" /> order to facilitate public discussion and consideration of the issues that are involved.</P>
      <P>The report contains a number of important recommendations and these are being examined in my own Department and in the Department of Finance. Discussions have taken place between officials of both Departments with a view to drawing up proposals for the structure of the new authority. It is my intention that these proposals, when finalised, will be submitted jointly by the Minister for Finance and myself to the Government for decision in due course. Following the Government's decision as to how it intends to proceed, I would expect that any legislation required for the establishment of the authority will be promoted by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 33 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of industry in the regions. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland, as part of its new focus, is seeking to deliver half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One region in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for this region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While seeking to increase its delivery of new jobs, IDA Ireland is at the same time working closely with the providers of infrastructure and <Col N="1160" /> the educational/training bodies to deliver improved facilities for industry in the regions. When a new project is attracted to an area the resulting boost in confidence makes it easier to persuade local authorities to improve infrastructure, colleges are encouraged to put on and fill new courses and private developers are more interested in providing advance buildings.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the new strategy is delivered on, IDA Ireland has reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and the allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its project divisions.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions. IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of the Objective One region, which is in line with the new EU state aid limits.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of this increased marketing focus on the Objective One region, there is a strong flow of potential clients visiting the region, including the advance factory in Cavan. The availability of the Cavan advance factory is critical to securing these site visits. IDA Ireland's objective is to secure a client for the advance factory at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    <P>In the Objective One region, IDA Ireland has acquired additional land in towns such as Letterkenny, Sligo, Portlaoise, Galway, Dundalk, Cavan and Drogheda. IDA Ireland has also upgraded many of its sites to business park standard and has arranged, in partnership with private developers, for the provision of advance factories and advance offices in a number of key centres.  </P>
    <P>The national development plan underpins IDA Ireland's new strategy as it will provide the necessary infrastructure to attract overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban area. IDA Ireland will be keeping in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of the agency's priorities. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also committed to ensuring that the benefits of economic development are dispersed evenly throughout the regions. The agency aims to ensure that a significant number of Irish owned new companies will be based in the regions and encourages existing companies contemplating expansion to locate in the BMW regions. To this effect Enterprise Ireland has deployed over 100 staff in its regional network.</P>

      <P>The Independent Group is composed of Mr. Kevin Bonner, Chairman, Professor Seamus Sheehy of UCD, and Mr. Colm McCarthy, economist.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group are to examine allegations of anti-competitive practice in the beef industry; to establish why there is such a large differential between the producer price and the prevailing consumer price; and, to make any appropriate recommendations in the matter.</P>

      <P>There are a total of 53 posts in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>The length of time served by current staff members varies from recent recruits to the office who have served for a number of months to those who have served ten years or more. In the past two years there have been approximately 18 staff changes in the office. The staff of the ODCA are civil servants who are attached to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As civil servants they are entitled to move within the Department and the wider Civil Service. I have no proposals to change the method of staffing of the office.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs was established by the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which stipulates that the office of director shall be independent in the exercise of her functions. I have at all times respected the independence of the Director of Consumer Affairs in the performance of the functions of her office and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Research of this type has not been carried out by my Department. In the context of the recent decision of Government on a more proactive immigration policy, resources are being made available to carry out research on the many aspects of migration including its economic impact. I expect that this research will encompass the housing issue.  </P>
      <P>Recently published immigration data by the Central Statistics Office does not suggest that increased house prices are having an undue negative impact on returning flows of Irish migrants. In fact, the most recent population and migration estimates show that immigration into Ireland, which was estimated at 47,500 for the 12 months to April 1999, is the highest figure on record since the present series began over 13 years ago and more than 50% higher than five years previously. More than half of all immigrants in 1999 were Irish nationals.</P>
      <P>Developments in the housing market are closely monitored by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister recently commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a general review of housing market developments since the introduction by Government of housing measures in April 1998 and March 1999, and to carry out an evaluation of recent developments in housing demand and supply and house prices. The review has commenced and it is expected that it will be concluded by the end of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the national development plan is geared towards addressing emerging infrastructural bottlenecks which can act as a potential econ<Col N="1163" /> omic risk. The plan provides the framework for an integrated investment strategy to facilitate the provision of a national housing programme of 500,000 houses over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>I will shortly be establishing a tripartite monitoring group, comprising representatives of my Department, IBEC and ICTU, to monitor the operation of the National Minimum Wage Act. I would anticipate that the group would, in the immediate future, be examining issues such as the compliance with, and enforcement of, the provisions of the Act, and in the longer term would review, as it considers appropriate, such issues as the impact of the legislation and the effectiveness of certain provisions.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Act, some job vacancy advertisements at rates of pay lower than permitted under the Act may inadvertently have remained on display at FÁS offices.</P>
      <P>I am informed that FÁS will not accept for display or advertise any employment vacancy at a rate of pay that is not in conformity with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. Where an employer is not prepared to give a pay rate, or insists on &ldquo;pay rate negotiable&rdquo;, FÁS staff will inform employers that FÁS will display the notice with a statement that the rate of pay is subject to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs, of which I am a member, has political responsibility for reviewing trends in drugs problems, assessing progress in implementing the national drugs strategy, and related policy issues. My Department is represented on the interdepartmental group on the national drugs strategy, reporting to the Cabinet committee. The interdepartmental committee meets in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team to oversee progress on the implementation of the strategy, and review Government policy on issues which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS, which is represented on the national drugs strategy team, is involved across a broad front in providing employment and training for drug workers and drug users. One thousand community employment, CE, places have been ring-fenced for projects in disadvantaged areas which deal with drug abusers or those recovering from such abuse. In addition, at least 100 participants on normal CE programmes come from the same <Col N="1165" /> categories. There are 36 FÁS funded special community employment drugs related projects with a capacity of 674 places currently up and running under the umbrella of the local drugs task forces. These programmes provide training inputs as an integral part of their delivery.</P>
    <P>A network of 52 FÁS funded community training workshops &ndash; CTWs &ndash; operate, for the most part, in the areas most affected by the drugs problems in collaboration with the local drugs task force where one is present in those areas. Many of these CTWs grew out of the need to tackle drugs and other issues affecting young people, and as a result, there is a high level of preventive activity in these workshops.</P>
    <P>Following a two year EU sponsored pilot programme FÁS has introduced an advocacy support structure for young people after they leave the workshops to enable them to continue their progression into adult and working life. This service is being rolled out over the next two years. The programme will comprise 30 advocates who will be located in the most severely deprived areas. Each advocate will have a caseload of 60 participants and will be available as a referral option for the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>It is intended also that staff in local FÁS employment offices, who are trained in career guidance and counselling, will provide assistance in the future for individuals with drug problems.</P>

      <P>A wide ranging package of measures in the company law and taxation areas was approved by the Government last year, to address problems arising from the use of certain Irish registered non-resident companies, IRNRs, for undesirable purposes. The measures have now been implemented. These taxation measures were implemented in the Finance Act, 1999, and the company law measures, contained in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, were commenced with effect from 23 March and 18 April this year, respectively.</P>
      <P>The package of measures will ensure all companies will have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the registrar of companies, through compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law. The company law and taxation measures are designed to complement each other and provide that a strong co-operative effort on the part of the relevant revenue and company law authorities will be a feature of the ongoing implementation process. An example of this is reflected in the strike off of companies, where the registrar will have power to strike off in situations where companies fail to supply the Revenue Commissioners, with information to enable them to be registered for tax purposes and revenue furnishes confirmation to this effect.</P>
      <P>Arising from a major exercise, carried out by the Revenue Commissioners which involved writing to more than 47,000 companies, seeking certain information for taxation purposes on foot of the new provisions in the Finance Act, 1999, Revenue has so far asked the registrar of companies to strike off 3,000 companies for failure to supply the information in question. The registrar is in discussions with Revenue as to the detailed arrangements for the strike off process for these companies.</P>
      <P>Apart from the companies notified for strike off by Revenue, the registrar has separately been pursuing a proactive strike off policy for some time, in respect of companies failing to file their annual returns to the companies registration office. In 1999, 31,157 companies were struck off the register, compared to 10,003 in 1998, while the number for the first quarter of this year was 12,299 compared to 12,855 for the same period in 1999. The corresponding company incorporation figures were 17,462 for 1999 as against 19,866 for 1998 &ndash; down over 2,000. However, the first quarter figures for 2,000 are 900 ahead of the corresponding period for 1999 &ndash; 6,050 as against 5,151.</P>

      <P>With the coming into force of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the authorised staff numbers at the Competition Authority were increased by around 50%. The current situation in regard to authorised numbers is that the authority is comprised of one full-time chairman, four full-time members, seven professional staff, that is two legal advisers and five economists, and 12 clerical-administrative staff. Over the past six months, the chairman and one full time member of the authority together with five professional staff, two legal advisers and three economists have resigned to take up alternative employment.</P>
      <P>The present staffing situation undoubtedly constrains the authority in discharging its functions. However, steps have been taken to fill all the vacancies as quickly as possible. Dr. John Fingleton will take up appointment to fill the vacant post of chairman of the authority next month and Dr. Paul Gorecki will fill the vacant post of member of the authority in June. Both have been appointed following an open competitive interview process held earlier this year. The two vacancies for legal advisers and three for economists are being filled by competitions being held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission. In addition, my Department, together with the authority, has now initiated a study of the authority's operations with a view to having the authority's future resource requirements assessed.</P>

      <P>It has been estimated that in order to meet the ambitious but achievable objectives of the national development plan, that is, strong growth, improved social infrastructure including housing, health and education as well as improved physical infrastructure that 200,000 workers will need to be added to the labour force to make up shortfalls and vacancies arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These needs will have to be met if we are to meet the objectives we have set ourselves in the national development plan to 2006. Over the per<Col N="1170" /> iod to 2006 it is estimated that some 88,000 workers will be required to meet labour market growth while a further 112,000 will be required to replace workers who will leave Ireland for a variety of reasons, for education or for personal or social development. Over half of the jobs to be filled will be in respect of ongoing migration from Ireland, a testimony to people's confidence in the labour market, and will, in the main, be filled by those who left earlier. We now have the opportunity of enabling both those who left, or those who were left out, to participate in our success with increased employment opportunities being taken up across the spectrum ranging from those moving from unemployment to increased participation from at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Irish migration effect will ease the strain as we seek to improve housing and infrastructure which will also be assisted by the Government's strong commitment to more balanced regional development.  The Government recently decided to establish an immigration policy advisory committee, which will include the social partners, to oversee the development and adjustment of immigration policy and that our skill requirements are appropriately aligned, sourced and viable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The number of new apprentices registered has increased by 90% from 3,597 in 1995-96 to 6,832 in the last academic year, with the result that there are currently in excess of 21,000 apprentices registered. The demand for training places for these apprentices has increased accordingly. The Department of Education and Science has increased the number of phase 4 and phase 6 training places by 80% since the 1997-98 academic year to 7,200 in the current academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major capital investment programme to provide additional phase 4 and phase 6 capacity is in train. Extra staff have been sanctioned and additional funding is being provided to meet the cost of additional courses. It is expected that training will be provided for an additional 1,300 apprentices in the next academic year. The Department of Education and Science is also liaising with the institutes of technology with a <Col N="1171" /> view to providing training for a minimum of 700 apprentices during the summer.</P>
    <P>These measures will improve the situation with regard to the bottlenecks at phases four and six of apprenticeship training. However, given the continuing increase in demand for apprenticeship training, the national apprenticeship advisory committee which operates under the aegis of FÁS and includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the social partners will continue to work to ensure that adequate levels of training provision are available to meet this demand.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 28 March 2000 on a range of measures to address Ireland's skill requirements, that is, realising the potential of the Irish labour market, investment in people-retraining, proactive promotion of skill requirements in the EEA, EU-applicant countries and globally.</P>
      <P>The Government also decided that a working visa system be introduced in respect of information and communication technologies, nursing skills and building professionals which are in short supply. The working visa system does not envisage quotas for particular countries or skills but the system will be informed by the realities of the labour market. As part of that process the social partners have been, and will be, consulted in the development and adjustment of immigration policy.</P>
      <P>For the sectors in short supply the working visa system will permit applicants to apply abroad to an Irish embassy or consulate for a single working visa, or authorisation if coming from a country where visas are not required for entry. The application will have to be supported by a job offer. Working visas-authorisations issued by embassies and consulates abroad will be valid for two years and permit multiple re-entry on the part of the holder. The visas-authorisations may be renewed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Nurses from certain countries may be required to undergo a period of supervised clinical practice in an Irish teaching hospital before they will be eligible for full registration with An Bord Altranais. Having obtained full registration with An Bord Altranais on satisfactory completion of the period of supervised practice such nurses will be issued with a further working visa-authorisation permitting them to work for a further 21 months. Such visas are renewable at two year intervals thereafter in the normal manner. visas-authorisations may be renewed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As already stated there are no quotas attaching to countries. However, the fact that applications are made through Irish embassies-consulates will permit an element of local knowledge and labour market impact to be gauged and ultimately assessed by the immigration policy advisory group which the Government recently decided to establish on which the social partners will be represented.</P>
      <P>The FÁS skills audit of asylum seekers is under way. The areas being covered are language proficiency, computer skills and technical skills. The audit will cover some 2,500 people over a two year period. The average age of those being interviewed is 25 to 30 years old.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 60, 79 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The skills needs of the economy can be met by the training and education of young people prior to entry to the labour market, by upskilling people at work, the unemployed and those currently outside the labour force, and by attracting skilled people from overseas.</P>
      <P>FÁS provides pre-entry training programmes such as apprenticeship, and a wide range of courses aimed at helping unemployed people and people outside the labour force acquire skills which will enhance their employability. These programmes reflect the skills needs of employers, balanced with the development needs of clients. Training provision is reviewed regularly and new courses are introduced in response to market demand and feedback from clients.</P>
      <P>FÁS, the enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department, and the enterprise-led Skillnets initiative support a range of training programmes for the employed. These programmes are intrinsically linked to the skill development needs of employers.</P>
      <P>The new pilot working visas programme which was recently announced is being focused on nursing, construction and information technology skills. This programme will augment the current work permits system in increasing the supply of identified skills within the economy.</P>
      <P>As regards information technology skills specifically, this has been a major area of focus for the expert group on future skills needs. The group's second report, which was recently launched, summarises the initiatives which have been taken to increase the supply of IT skills. The report also reviews the current outlook and concludes that the initiatives which have been taken in response to the first report will significantly close the identified skills gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken together, these measures represent a concerted effort to meet skills requirements. Given the extremely dynamic nature of the econ<Col N="1174" /> omy, and the rapid changes in technology and ways of doing business, it is neither desirable nor feasible to adopt a ten year horizon when forecasting skills requirements. The Government has put in place the expert group on future skills needs so that the skills requirements of the economy can be reviewed and updated on a continuous basis in response to the needs of enterprise and the changing business environment. This approach is proving effective in building up detailed knowledge of the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy and developing solutions to identified needs.</P>

These difficulties arose during the negotiations which took place in the tripartite working group on the implementation of the directive and related, in particular, to the scope of the directive and whether non-contributory occupational pensions came within that scope. Difficulties also arose in agreeing a definition of &ldquo;workers who work on a casual basis&rdquo; who may be excluded from certain benefits on objective grounds.</P>

I believe that consumers must be given fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a pub so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high. The order is enforced by the director of consumer affairs. I understand from the director that a number of publicans have received final warnings regarding their non-compliance with the order. I should add that the option of prosecutions for non-compliance with the order is there should the director consider it to be warranted.</P>

      <P>FÁS-ESRI have just published their occupational employment forecasts to 2005. At the beginning of the document, they draw on the ESRI Medium Term Review 1999-2005 to set out broad employment trends from 1990 to 2005.</P>
      <P>ESRI identified the main contributors to employment growth between 1995 and 2000 to be: building and construction a 69% increase from 1995 to 2000; high-technology manufacturing; 52% increase from 1995 to 2000, for example, information technology, pharmaceuticals; market services; 34% increase from 1995 to 2000, for example, telecommunications, professional services.</P>
      <P>While there is no reason to question the sustainability of the jobs created in these sectors in recent years, ESRI projects a slowdown in overall employment creation between 2000 and 2005 to 11%, compared to the 24% overall increase in employment from 1995 to 2000.</P>
      <P>ESRI identifies high-technology manufacturing and market services as the main contributors to employment creation in the medium term future. It forecasts a much slower growth rate for employment in building and construction as &ldquo;the sector reaches the point when it can largely cope with the ongoing level of demand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards the supply of qualified personnel, the business, education and training partnership was set up in 1997 to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation and education and training for business. The expert group on future skills needs is an element of the partnership. The partnership approach in general, and the expert group on future skills needs in particular have identified areas where action can be taken to ensure that skills needs are being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group has produced two reports to date. Its first report, published in December 1998, examined the area of information technology skills. Its second report, published in March 2000, examined a range of skill areas, including skilled construction craftspersons and the chemical and biological sciences. The executive summary of the second report draws attention to the work of the group to date and sets out key recommendations <Col N="1179" /> to address some of the skills needs in the economy.</P>
    <P>I have asked the expert group to continue its valuable work by analysing other skills needs in the economy and to monitor the situation as it evolves in those sectors analysed to date.</P>
    <P>I am confident that industry itself will continue the active training of its employees to ensure productivity and competitiveness in its workforce. Such training has been supported by State funding and this support, in common with that for new investment and research and development projects, will continue as set out in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>According to the CSO Annual Services Inquiry, 1997, the number of persons engaged in the retail grocery trade for 1997 was 73,110, an increase of 25,233 since 1991. Of the total engaged, 25,388 were full-time, 36,190 were part-time and 11,532 were proprietors.</P>
      <P>The CSO Census of Industrial Production, 1997 indicates that there were 46,327 persons engaged in the manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco of which 40,262 were engaged in the food sector. While this latter figure includes those engaged in manufacture of food products for both domestic and overseas markets, it is clear that the numbers employed in supply of the domestic market is very significant. In addition, there are employees in importers and distributors and wholesalers serving the grocery trade. The CSO Annual Services Inquiry 1997 shows that there were 11,046 persons engaged in the wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco.</P>
      <P>In addition, indirect employment associated with the grocery trade would include the numbers engaged in developing new retail outlets, new food factories as well as the refurbishment and redevelopment of existing ones. There are no statistics available on the number of persons engaged in such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO household budget survey shows that average weekly household expenditure on food has increased by 25.8% between 1987 and 1994-95. This increase in average expenditure, combined with the impact of rapidly increasing employment levels in the economy and new household formation, suggests expenditure on food will continue to increase significantly. This increase, combined with high levels of investment by existing and new entrants to the industry, <Col N="1180" /> should result in further increases in employment in the grocery industry, which I welcome.</P>

      <P>In addition to consultations with the social partners on the consultants' recommendations, my Department has also had discussions with a number of inner-Dublin city groups on the operation of JI. The question of an appropriate level of roll-over for those participants who would benefit from a further period on the programme, as recommended by the consultants, has been raised in these discussions.</P>
      <P>The consultants have also recommended the development of a high support programme on a pilot basis to meet the needs of those most distanced from the labour market. A study into this matter will be pursued by my Department as soon as possible, as provided for under framework IV of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland is seeking to increase its delivery of new jobs particularly into the regions and, at the same time, the agency is working closely with the providers of infrastructure and the educational-training bodies etc., to delivery improved facilities for industry. The agency's job creation objectives take into account the need for attracting inward investment to unemployment blackspots and areas of social deprivation.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is deeply committed to developing indigenous industry and to regional dispersal and this is reflected in the deployment of more than 100 staff in its regional network of offices. Strategies are also being developed by the agency which will take account of employment needs throughout all regions of the country, especially in high need areas. In addition, the new community enterprise centre initiative is specifically targeted at the needs of high urban unemployment areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to the efforts of the enterprise support agencies, the labour market policies pursued by my Department focus on promoting increased employment throughout the country in both urban and rural areas and meeting the skills needs of the economy. Key elements of these policies include early intervention aimed at reducing the duration of unemployment, the FÁS action for the long-term unemployed and a range of measures aimed at developing specific skills among new entrants to the labour market, the unemployed and those in employment.</P>
      <P>The work of the area based partnerships operating under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is also relevant to addressing the employment needs in areas of social and economic deprivation.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Government established the Expert on Future Skills Needs to identify in a systematic way the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy and to advise on the actions necessary to meet those needs. The group has published two reports to ensure that qualified people are being trained to fill jobs, the first of which has been implemented and the second of which, published in March 2000, is currently being considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche, management consultants, were commissioned in 1996 to undertake a study on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. Comparisons with other jurisdictions were made in respect of motor and public liability insurance. The study found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in other EU countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transactions cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses. In response to these findings, a special working group was established under the aegis of our Department. I have just received the group's final report and I am currently examining its recommendations.</P>
      <P>The special working group, as part of its remit, commissioned research into the processing of personal injury claims in Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as a research based study of personal injury compensation systems in operation in other European countries, New Zealand and the United States. However, this research does not specifically address the issue of motor and public liability insurance cover in the various countries.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also identified improved health and safety measures in the workplace as a way of reducing costs. I would regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice, in safe working and accident prevention, as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace.</P>

      <P>Ireland's remarkable economic performance in recent years has been the subject of considerable attention internationally, in particular, our impressive GNP growth, export growth, and employment creation. These achievements are due to a variety of different factors working together, including: investment in education; investment in telecommunications; a targeted approach to the encouragement of foreign direct investment; membership of the EU and preparations for and the operation of EMU.</P>
      <P>It is important to keep in mind the long-term needs of the economy and the sustainability of growth for the future when discussing enterprise and trade prospects. Action is being taken under the following headings to ensure that the correct conditions are established for a continuation of a competitive environment:</P>
      <P>Investment: Ireland's gross fixed capital formation continues to expand. Gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GNP has more than kept pace with growth. In fact, it has expanded as a percentage of GNP, from 20.7% in 1990 to 25.7% in 1998. This demonstrates that we are making basic policy choices, both in the private sector and in the public sector, to make sure that consumption does not take place at the expense of future prospects;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Labour: Healthy and flourishing labour markets are essential for continued growth, and the Government has taken a number of steps to expand the labour force and to upgrade skills. The taxation system has been reformed to provide additional incentives to work, thus increasing the supply of labour, and policy measures are already being implemented to encourage increased immigration to meet specific skill requirements;</P>
    <P>Technology: the process of globalisation is being driven by technological change. Much of Ireland's current growth is due to its concentration on foreign industries, and increasingly on Irish owned industries specialising in areas such as information and communications technologies, software, biotechnology, and financial engineering. Autonomous expansion of research and development capabilities in this process is being further enhanced through Government action with specific initiatives to encourage research and development, including significant commitments both in the education sphere and through the technology foresight programme. Resources allocated to research and development in the national development plan now exceed £1 billion;</P>
    <P>Infrastructure: A specific aspect of capital spending which will prove essential for sustained growth is that of expenditure on infrastructure, especially road, rail and airport facilities, in order to improve public transport and business services generally. Expenditure on transport infrastructure rose from £237 million in 1990 to £360 million in 1996, and the further significant commitment to infrastructural investment in the national development plan augurs well for continued growth.</P>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, these indicators show that the Government has given high priority not only to improving current living standards but also to making sure that necessary investment in the public sector takes place to sustain growth in enterprise and trade in the long term.</P>

      <P>EU generated legislation in force in Ireland since 1994 has had the effect of opening up EU markets, including the Irish market, to competition from insurance providers based throughout the EU. In addition, I believe the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the level of insurance premiums, especially in the areas of public liability and motor, are still high enough to give concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of premiums focusing on a number of the key cost elements including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination efforts are being made to identify measures which both individually and cumulat<Col N="1186" /> ively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
    <P>Following consideration by Government of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, a special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. In 1998, the special working group completed the first part of its remit and recommended a structure for a voluntary mediation system for occupational injuries which could be operated within the reformed courts system.</P>
    <P>I have just received the special working group's second and final report on a personal injuries tribunal and I am currently in the process of examining the report and its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was re-established in 1998, continues to provide information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs together with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
    <P>Apart from Government initiatives, greater attention to safety in the workplace and on the roads can further reduce insurance costs. Accordingly, I launched the voluntary code of practice adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group, a group representing the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation. Also a number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am confident that the legislation in place, together with the initiatives on insurance costs, trends, delivery and cover outlined, all help in ensuring that the consumer is protected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan makes provision for substantial investment in public transport in the southern and eastern region including Waterford. This includes major track renewal on the Waterford line, including upgrading of level crossings along with bridge renewal and fencing programmes. Between 2000 and 2002 there will be approximately £7 million spent on the Waterford-Dublin line under the rail safety programme, with £3 million being spent in 2000.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann also plans to upgrade facilities at several locations in the south-east region including Waterford.</P>
      <P>Following the success of the high frequency service on the Dublin-Galway and DublinLimerick routes, similar development is planned for the Tralee-Waterford corridors. Improved frequency between Waterford-Limerick and Waterford-Dublin services is also planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Within Waterford city, service improvements include increased frequency and extension of Farran Park route. A new bus station at Merchant's Quay, Waterford, opened in March 2000. There will be expenditure of approximately £3 million on improvements on Bus Eireann services in Waterford over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-06, with approximately £1 million being spent in 2000.</P>
    <P>I recently awarded £155,000 to Waterford Regional Airport for marketing and promotion purposes. Under the national development plan, £3 million has been awarded for incremental infrastructural improvement works and upgrades in facilities at the regional airports in the south and east region. Under this plan substantial support will be provided for agreed infrastructural improvements at Waterford Regional Airport.</P>
    <P>Under the economic infrastructure operational programme, £118,135 has been allocated to Waterford Internet Centre Limited for investment in e-kiosks in the south-east and a further £103,400 has been allocated to Eircom for the development of a broadband network between Ardmore, County Waterford and Youghal, County Cork as part of a broadband access project. Both of these projects are due for completion during 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the long delay for small business getting an ISDN line as in a case of a person (details supplied) who is waiting over five months; her views on whether this is seriously hampering small businesses; and the plans, if any, she has to overcome this infrastructural bottleneck.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some very unacceptable delays in the provision of ISDN lines to small businesses. This is unacceptable both for the businesses themselves and for the economy generally. Ready availability of ISDN lines and equivalent services at reasonable prices is essential to the continued success of the economy and I would expect to see such services available here under similar conditions as is available in other countries.</P>
      <P>A number of steps have been taken by my Department and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in an attempt to overcome such problems.</P>
      <P>In the case of Eircom, following a consultation process initiated by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the company has introduced service level agreements, SLAs, to ensure that services such as ISDN lines are delivered within a reasonable timeframe. However, these SLAs only cover services offered by Eircom to other licensed telecoms operators. I understand that there is provision in Eircom's licence to allow the director to impose similar conditions on Eircom in regard to services offered to retail customers but the decision to take any action in this regard is solely a matter for the director. It is my understanding that to impose such obligations in a competitive retail market would be contrary to the stated aims of promoting light-handed regulation in a liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>The director has also embarked upon a programme measuring key performance indicators such as service provisioning, complaints handling and the number of faults. These figures will be ready for publication next year.</P>
      <P>Finally, in co-operation with my Department, the ODTR is well upon the way to licensing alternative platforms for the delivery of high speed data services such as digital cable and wireless in the local loop. This will promote competition in the provision of such services and alleviate any bottlenecks that may exist.</P>

      <P>The 1999 area aid application details for the person named have now been entered on the Department's electronic database. The person named claimed a total of 87.88 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 84.40 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 3.48 hectares or 4.12% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case a penalty of 6.96 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 77.44 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The existing procedures for the award of public sector contracts of a value of £5,000, inclusive of VAT, or more, within any 12 month period, require the contractor to produce either a valid tax clearance or C2 certificate. To obtain a tax clearance certificate an applicant must have complied with the obligations regarding the payment and remittance of taxes, interest and penalties and the delivery of returns due to revenue. Where those obligations are not complied with by the applicant, the Collector-General is entitled to refuse to issue tax clearance. A C2 certificate relates to the building, meat processing and forestry industries. Issue of a C2 certificate is subject to similar conditions as regards the payment of tax and delivery of returns.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the existing arrangements for tax clearance are adequate and represent a fair balance between the State's need to protect its flow of tax revenues and the needs of business to function without an excess of regulation.

    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): As I indicated in a reply to the Deputy on 15 February last, section 9 of the Waiver of Certain Tax Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, provides penalties for failure to comply with that legislation. There are two elements to a possible offence under this section: the knowing and wilful commission of a revenue offence before 5 April 1991 and the failure to make an amnesty declaration or a correct amnesty declaration.</P>
    <P>To date there have been no prosecutions under section 9. This reflects, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that suf<Col N="1198" /> ficient evidence to ground such charges was not available or that evidence to ground other charges was more readily available.</P>
    <P>Where the elements of a possible offence under section 9 appear to be present in a case and the requisite evidence to ground a successful prosecution may be available, the possibility of prosecution under section 9 is investigated. Of the 28 cases at present being considered for possible prosecution, 11 cases have circumstances which appear to come within section 9.</P>

    <P>I understand from the NTMA that tax clearance requirements were complied with in all cases. It should be noted that many of the above amounts include payments by the company concerned to third parties for services such as printing and press advertisements.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the Civil Service Commission, the Valuation Office, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of Public Works and the State Laboratory placed no contracts with the company concerned. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised me that records of contract payments together with the identities of recipients are held on its financial management system. The original computerised system was introduced in 1992 and only holds records from that year. There is no record of any payment being made to the company concerned since 1992 under any contract. However, an individual revenue official has a recollection of attending a communications course in 1987 or 1988 which was presented by the individual identified with the company concerned. All manual records of payments prior to 1992 have been destroyed.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, that the disabled person meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. In cases where the issue of the certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The board of appeal has advised the Revenue Commissioners that the person named wrote to the board on 12 April 2000, appealing the refusal of a primary medical certificate. The person has been advised by the chairman of the board that, on the basis of an examination of the medical information submitted with the letter of appeal, it would appear that the medical criteria are not met at this time. However if the person still wishes to proceed with the appeal he or she should advise the board accordingly who will arrange an appointment for the physical assessment to take place in due course. It is regretted that the Revenue Commissioners cannot consider an application for relief under the scheme without the issue of the required certificate.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group under the chair of an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria, and I hope to receive its report later in the year.</P>

      <P>With effect from 6 April 2000, the standard rate band is £28,000 for a married couple with no child dependants, where one spouse does not have income, and where the couple are under joint assessment for income tax purposes. The standard rate band of £28,000 may be extended by up to £6,000 to £34,000, where both spouses are in receipt of income.</P>
      <P>The Deputy queries the position in the case of a married couple where one spouse has a salary of £45,000 and the other spouse does not work outside the home but the couple has income from lettings of £7,000 per annum. The position depends on whether, the property from which the rental income is derived, is jointly owned, solely owned by the spouse in receipt of the salary, or solely owned by the spouse not in receipt of the salary, and will be determined by the specific facts of a case.</P>
      <P>If the property is not owned solely or jointly by a particular spouse, then rental income from such property may not be returned by that spouse under schedule D for the purpose of obtaining the increased rate band.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to each scenario is outlined as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Property Jointly Owned</P>
      <P>In this case each spouse is entitled to rental income of £3,500 per annum. The position in relation to the standard rate band is as follows:</P>

      <P>Prior to 8 March 2000, the taxpayer was registered as self-employed and as such he was required to pay income tax under the self-assessment system. The taxpayer has not paid preliminary tax as required under self-assessment in 1998-9 or 1999-2000. Preliminary tax must be paid on or before 1 November each year. Preliminary tax for 1998-9, for instance, should have been paid not later than 1 November 1998.</P>

      <P>The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the proposed extension of the 1993 EU directive on working time to doctors in training. Deputies will be aware that different stances on this issue had been taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Agreement was reached recently on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of <Col N="1203" /> the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years allowed.</P>

      <P>The national cochlear implant programme has been established at Beaumont Hospital since 1995. There is ongoing assessment and monitoring in most large centres, including Beaumont Hospital, of all patients who have received implants. This system of evaluation and pooling of information leads to refinement in selection criteria and is an essential tool in determining potential patients considered most suitable for cochlear implantation. This is clear proof that there is a sufficient body of evidence to support the benefits of cochlear implantation in adults and children.</P>

As the Deputy may be aware, an investment of £20 million, revenue and capital funding, over a three year period has been committed to support that initiative.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £3 million has already been invested this year, aimed at increasing the number of dialysis places available and at improving the availability of alternative dialysis treatment options. The principles underpinning this investment are to ensure that haemo-dialysis is available on a regionally self-sufficient basis so that patients do not have to travel long distances to avail of it and to ensure an equitable availability of treatment choice for patients irrespective of their geographical location. In addition, services must be patient centred and evidence based, there must be effective and accountable use of resources invested for the benefit of renal patients and there must to be an inclusive decision making process at all levels.</P>
      <P>In addition to the revenue funding already allocated, capital projects to improve and extend dialysis facilities will also be funded by my Department and in this regard a number of proposals are currently being developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of deferring different categories of blood donors from donating blood is a matter for the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. There is no proven instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products, but the theoretical possibility associated with variant CJD, cannot be excluded at this time. There is currently no screening test to detect the presence of vCJD. For my part, I will ensure that the IBTS has adequate resources to introduce proven new technologies in this area.</P>
      <P>Experimental animal models suggest that the infectivity of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include vCJD, may be associated with white blood cells in animal systems. White blood cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters. This process is called leucodepletion, and the IBTS, as a precautionary measure in order to minimise the theoretical risk of transmission introduced leucodepletion for cellular products in 1999.</P>
      <P>The IBTS's policy is to permanently defer potential donors who may be at risk of carrying CJD, including donors who have received a dura mater transplant, human pituitary derived growth hormone or have one or more blood relatives with CJD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Europe's committee of experts on blood transfusion and Immunohaematology recommend that the balance of risk between maintaining an adequate blood supply and minimising a theoretical risk has to be considered in the decision making process. They advise that care must be taken to ensure that any precautionary measure proposed will not impact adversely on the donation, safety and supply of blood <Col N="1207" /> necessary to meet patients' needs. Furthermore, the populations of Ireland and other European countries differ from those of countries such as North America in the extent of their exposure to UK bovine derived material. In countries with a higher historical exposure to BSE, measures to defer donors who have spent time in the United Kingdom may reduce donor supply without enhancing safety. European countries are actively evaluating this matter at present. Some countries recommend that potential blood donors who spent a total of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996 be permanently deferred from donating blood. As part of the decision making process, the countries in question assessed the likely effect of such decisions on their blood procurement policies. I understand that the effects for those countries was in the order of a 2% reduction in supply whereas the effect in this country would be a 13% shortfall in donors.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, has indicated that it is anxious to consult more widely with national and international expertise and have more detailed discussions on the matter before recommending any change in the current position. They support the IBTS's proposals to reinforce guidelines on the optimal use of blood in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The strategy of ongoing monitoring of the emerging scientific data will continue as a matter of priority involving the IBTS, the Irish Medicines Board, and the CJD advisory group, which is advising me on matters relevant to CJD. I am planning to have a series of consultations with these bodies to keep the matter under constant review. The advice and evidence from EU scientific and medical experts is also being regularly evaluated to assess whether current strategies ought to be revised and this will continue to be the case. I will ensure that adequate resources are available for this purpose.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Irish Medicines Board has identified seven major deficiencies in good medical practice at the Blood Transfusion Service Board; if he will carry out an investigation into a report that the medical officer, who reviewed deferred donors between 6 and 28 December 1999, may not have been trained to the relevant standard particularly in view of the fact that it was during this period that two deferred donors managed to give blood, one unit of which was later transfused to a patient.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board reports on an annual basis in respect of its inspections of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Two annual reports have been presented to date and I expect to receive shortly a third report in respect of the year ended December 1999. In its inspections, the IMB follows the requirements of good manufacturing practice, GMP and I presume it is this, rather than good medical practice, to which the Deputy is referring. GMP encompasses such items as quality management, personnel, premises and equipment, documentation, production and quality control. My Department has been advised that deficiencies in GMP identified by the IMB have been or are being rectified by the IBTS. My Department has and will continue to ensure that adequate resources are available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In relation to the donor deferral incident referred to by the Deputy, this arose in December 1999 when work was being completed on the Blood Transfusion Service Board's computer system to make it year 2000 compliant. The computer check to identify any donations received from donors who were temporarily deferred did not function properly. The board's staff identified the malfunction which was rectified as soon as it was discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the computer problem was rectified, donation reports for December were rerun and two donations were identified which had been taken from donors who were temporarily deferred due to recent nose piercing in one case, and recent acupuncture from a non-medically <Col N="1209" /> registered practitioner in the other. On investigation, the BTSB found that both of the deferred donors attended at a clinic which was different to the one previously attended, and that both completed medical questionnaires and omitted to mention the information which had previously led to their deferrals.</P>
    <P>The vital security check when processing blood is the sensitive laboratory testing which is carried out on all donations. Both donations had been subjected to rigorous laboratory checks and were found to be safe. Nevertheless, the standard recall procedure was initiated as soon as the problem was identified, which resulted in one donation being recalled and discarded before use. Red cells and plasma from the second donation were also recalled and discarded, however platelets had been infused into one patient. The donor whose platelets had been infused was traced in early January and agreed to undergo further tests. Blood samples were obtained and tested negative for all viral markers.</P>
    <P>Any potential breach of security is recorded by the BTSB and, in turn, is examined by the IMB as the regulatory authority. In this instance, the BTSB notified the IMB on 4 January of the problem with the deferred donors and the IMB requested a report on the incident and on corrective actions. The IMB notified my Department on 7 January and my Department also requested the BTSB to provide a report on the incident as soon as possible. On 11 January the national medical director of the BTSB made his report to the IMB and supplied a copy to my Department. As soon as final testing was completed on the donor whose blood had been infused, the BTSB gave the Department details of the tests which had been completed and the results which, as I have already stated, were all negative. In relation to staff training, the medical registrar who had temporarily replaced the medical officer normally assigned to this area had not been fully trained in all aspects of the procedure and the relevant training documentation was incomplete. I understand that this matter has now been addressed and that the training documentation is now in place.</P>
    <P>My Department has made available approximately £4 million to replace the existing computer system. The new system &ndash; Progesa &ndash; is in use in many other transfusion centres internationally. Implementation of the new software is under way and a period of parallel running will take place before the system goes live during the summer.</P>

      <P>As part of an external review of drug services for the Eastern Health Board, which was carried out in 1999, an analysis was made over a four month period of urine tests in five of the board's drug treatment clinics. This analysis showed that over that period 65% of the clients attending the clinics tested positive for benzodiazepines.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, had a major impact on limiting the availability of methadone on the illicit market. The situation regarding benzodiazepines is, however, not as clearcut as for methadone. Even in health board treatment clinics benzodiazepines may be legitimately prescribed to drug misusers, so there is an issue around determining clinical guidelines for management of drug misusers and appropriate dosages of various medications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's officials have written to all general practitioners on a number of occasions concerning the need for them to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs, including <Col N="1212" /> benzodiazepines. In the most recent letter, 30 August 1999, from my Department's chief medical officer to all general practitioners, he advised doctors to contact health board GP co-ordinators on best clinical practice in relation to treatment of opiate misusers, and he gave contact names and telephone numbers where assistance could be obtained. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, of course, I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of establishing a committee to examine benzodiazepine prescribing which will make recommendations on how misuse of these drugs can be reduced or eliminated.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only &ndash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999, with a threshold of £42 per individual or <Col N="1213" /> family unit. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons his Department has failed to comply with declarations and court orders made in proceedings brought before the High Court relating to children following on from the FN case in 1995; and the action, if any, he is taking to ensure that declarations and orders made are properly complied with.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the State parties to the cases brought before the High Court following on from the FN case have invariably included Ireland, the Attorney General and the Minister for Education and Science, formerly the Minister for Education. The Minister for Health and Children, formerly the Minister for Health, has usually been a party to such proceedings. I should add that health boards, principally the former Eastern Health Board, have also been party to such proceedings. While I am not aware of the State parties or of the health boards involved in such proceedings failing to comply with orders of the High Court little progress was made by the Deputy's party when it was in Government in addressing the issue of specialised residential care for children in need of special care or protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came to office in 1997 it has invested more than £60 million revenue in the development of our child care services including new child and family support services such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards to provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place <Col N="1216" /> specialised residential care in an appropriate context. This additional funding has allowed the health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places available from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 63 places which includes a number of individual high support packages.</P>
    <P>My Department has approved health board proposals to develop 110 additional high support and special care places nationally. As part of this programme of developments, seven additional places have already been created in the South-Eastern Health Board and an additional eight place unit for girls has been opened and is being brought into operation on a phased basis in the Southern Health Board. These developments are included in the current total of 63 places.</P>
    <P>Plans are well advanced by the health boards to develop other additional places nationally as part of this programme as follows: </P>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a purpose built special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan, commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will open in the summer of this year. The development of a 24 bed purpose built high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at a tender stage. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. A site has been acquired and a project manager and a project group have been put in place to develop the proposal.</P>
    <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: 20 high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; three high support places in the South-Eastern Health Board; and five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a special care facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001. The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department was established in October 1998 and it continues to meet regularly to monitor the overall development of these services.</P>
    <P>I might add that I met the chair and members of the new interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection at its inaugural meeting this morning. This new body will advise the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on co-ordinating the delivery of services and on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities and in those facilities run by or under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science for offending children. The special residential services board provided for in part 11 of the Chil<Col N="1217" /> dren Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, will take over the interim body's responsibilities when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that these measures, together with the enactment of the Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Part 3 of which will provide for the detention of a non-offending child in need of special care or protection by a health board on foot of a court order, will obviate the need for High Court proceedings in respect of such cases.</P>

      <P>My Department engaged Goodbody economic consultants to conduct a review of the school meals scheme in September 1997. Their report was completed in April 1998 and provides a useful analysis of the scheme. The consultants also set out their recommendations for the future operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this, an interdepartmental working group was established, as part of the programme <Col N="1221" /> evaluation process, to review the scheme from first principles. Programme evaluation has twin aims of providing (i) a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each spending programme and (ii) a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes. The analysis and recommendations contained in the report by Goodbody economic consultants provide a valuable input to the working group's deliberations in relation to the future policy direction for the scheme.</P>
    <P>A similar approach, whereby consultants' analysis has been used to form the background to the policy recommendations, has been used in other reviews undertaken by my Department, for example, the review of the national and smokeless fuel schemes, the review of the schemes of grants for locally-based women's groups and for locally-based men's groups.</P>
    <P>The working group held its first meeting in September 1999 and expects to complete its work before the end of the year. The group is composed of representatives from my Department, the  Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government and Finance, Dublin Corporation and the County and City Managers Association. The terms of reference for the working group follow.</P>
    <P>To examine and report on the school meals scheme with a view to: (a) identifying its objectives; (b) considering the extent to which these objectives remain valid and compatible with the mission and the current strategy of the Department; (c) evaluating the extent to which these objectives have been achieved; (d) establishing the level and trend of (a) the cost and (b) the staffing resources associated with the scheme activity; (e) defining the outputs associated with the scheme's activity and identifying the level and trend of those outputs; (f) commenting on how efficiently and effectively the scheme has  achieved the objectives; (g) evaluating the degree to which the objectives warrant the allocation of public resources on a current on-going basis; (h) examining the scope for alternative policy and-or  organisational approaches to achieving the objectives on a more efficient and effective basis: (i) specifying suitable performance indicators which can be used to monitor and evaluate the scheme in the future.</P>

With an expected annual average inflation rate of 3% for 2000, this year's increases will be ahead of expected inflation, representing a real increase of 2.3% for recipients of disability allowance.</P>
      <P>In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances are being provided as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This means that the couple rate of disability allowance will increase by £7.80 a week &ndash; 6.7% &ndash; which represents a real increase of 3.6%.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May. This means that some 51,200 recipients of disability allowance will receive the increased rates of payment four weeks earlier than in previous years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments, last December's budget also provided for a number of other improvements for people with disabilities, including the payment of full-rate disability allowance to those in full-time residential care, which will result in an increase of £40.70 a week in such cases; and a 50% increase, from £50 to £75 a week, in the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which is disregarded for disability allowance purposes. This enhanced disregard has also been extended to those in rehabilitative self-employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The submission made by the national representative council &ndash; NRC &ndash; which proposes increasing the disability allowance to £100 a week, raises two separate issues: the adequacy of social welfare payment rates, and the question of the additional costs associated with disability.</P>
    <P>With regard to the adequacy of social welfare rates, including the rate of disability allowance, it should be noted that the recently ratified Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF &ndash; provides that over the next three years all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment.</P>
    <P>The NRC has proposed that the rate of disability allowance be increased to £100 per week so as to compensate for the additional costs associated with disability. However it should be noted that, in addressing the question of these additional costs, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities distinguished between income maintenance needs and the additional costs associated with a disability.</P>
    <P>The commission recognised that people with disabilities incur additional costs regardless of whether they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or are in employment. It was for this reason they recommended that the additional costs associated with disability should be met through the introduction of a separate costs of disability payment, which would be paid regardless of the person's employment status.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance will set up and participate in a working group which will consult with the social partners to examine the feasibility of introducing a costs of disability payment.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the work of this group will be important in informing future policy in this area, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance and invalidity pension.</P>

    <P>A companion pass is available to recipients of <Col N="1224" /> a disability allowance who are certified as unfit to travel alone and people who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and are confined to a wheelchair.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>A pilot project to enhance information services for families is under way in Waterford. The project, which is one of three nationally, builds on the one stop shop concept with the aim of providing access to information for families through the social welfare local office. Within the pilot programme an enhanced programme of support will be provided for a small group of customers with complex needs. The resource allocated to the pilot for the year is £120,000, in addition to staffing and accommodation.</P>
      <P>This Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed and capital funding to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>The 2000 scheme of grants was advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers on 27 January 2000. Closing date for receipt of applications was 10 March 2000. Applications are currently being assessed in the regional offices of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community groups seeking funding under the various grants schemes operated by this Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus <Col N="1225" /> and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, the Department must establish the extent to which groups, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>As a large number of applications have been received by this Department, it is not possible at present to indicate the number, or possible beneficiaries of grant aid for specific capital projects. Groups in Waterford will be advised by the south-east regional office on the position of their application as soon as all applications have been assessed. Details of all grants made under the various schemes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year to 1999 for the information of members.</P>
    <P>Details of all the 2000 grants will be likewise made available early in 2001.</P>

      <P>There have been no consultations to date with the Irish Association of Professional Archaeologists, IAPA, in relation to the drawing up of a draft code of practice between the National Roads Authority and my Department. The code of practice is intended to form the basis of a framework within existing legislation and policies and within which the NRA will be able to progress with its programme of work while carrying out appropriate archaeological mitigation which have regard to a set of principles and agreed actions by both parties. As this is strictly a bilateral arrangement concerning specifically the operational activities of the NRA and my Department, there are no plans for consultations with other parties in drafting the code. For the same reasons, it is not intended to publish it prior to its adoption. My officials are very familiar with the archaeological implications of road construction, and I can assure you that these concerns will be addressed fully in the context of the code of practice.</P>

      <P>A draft code of practice is still being developed and is the subject of ongoing negotiations between the National Roads Authority and my officials. I cannot say at this stage what the outcome of these discussions will be but it is my intention that the code will make provision for appropriate levels of archaeological monitoring on all major road construction projects and that, where sites are discovered as a result of such monitoring, they will be investigated having regard to the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate that it is my intention that that the code will make provision for appropriate levels of archaeological monitoring all major construction projects. Also, any archaeological sites discovered in the course of road development will be investigated in the normal way in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, as well as my published policy and guidelines on archaeological excavations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to strike the right balance between much needed infrastructural development which is essential to the economic success of the State, and the requirement to pre<Col N="1227" /> serve our rich archaeological heritage. I can assure the Deputy that a minimalist approach to the protection of our archaeological heritage will not be adopted in the code of practice.</P>

      <P>Works have commenced at St. John's Castle, Dungarvan. These works include the restoration of the barrack building for use as visitor's reception, provision of exhibition and guide facilities. Conservation works are also in progress on the 13th century shell keep and enclosing bawn wall. The estimated cost of this project is £1.4 million which is part funded under the EU operational programme for tourism.</P>
      <P>Works are also in progress at the French Church-Reginald's Tower. These works include provision of exhibition at Reginald's Tower and completion of conservation and presentation works at French Church. These works comprise masonry cleaning, repointing and the repair and conservation of carved stonework. Visitor access will be improved and information panels will be provided. The estimated cost of this project is £380,000, most of which is funded under the EU operational programme for tourism.</P>
      <P>A grant of £100,000 was sanctioned by my Department this year to Comhairle Pobail na Rinne under Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht in respect of the development of Halla na Rinne, Dún Garbhán. Work on this project is currently in progress, and is expected to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>A grant of £140,000 was sanctioned by my Department in 1998 to Coláiste na Rinne under the aforementioned scheme in respect of the building of a sports hall at Coláiste na Rinne. It is expected that work on this project may commence by the end of this year.</P>

Form 104 is a statistical return which does not involve the coroner <Col N="1230" /> and is made by the Garda directly to the Central Statistics Office when the outcome of a coroner's inquest is known.</P>
    <P>The Coroners Act, 1962, provides that a death may be reported either directly to the coroner or indirectly through the Garda who, in turn, report the death to the coroner. In this particular case, notification of death was made directly by the hospital and the procedures involved in the Garda completing forms C71 and 104 did not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the request for a meeting with the widow of the deceased, I am agreeable to this, in principle, and my office will be in touch directly with the woman concerned.</P>

      <P>A full range of medical services is provided to all prisoners by one or more part-time doctors in each prison. In addition, psychiatric services are provided when required. My Department is in the process of finalising a service with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve the organisation and level of psychiatric input in prisons in the Dublin area. We would envisage extending this arrangement, where feasible, with other health providers.</P>
      <P>The provision of specific specialist services for conditions such as ADD-ADHD is reviewed in the context of similar services being available in the general community and the relative need for such services for prisoners.</P>
      <P>I have commissioned a survey of the health status of prisoners which is being undertaken by the department of health promotion at NUI, Galway. I understand that this study will give some indication of the prevalence of ADD-ADHD in the prison population as well as a variety of other health related issues involving prisoners. When the results are available I would hope to publish them without undue delay.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated my intention to follow the practice of recent years and increase the maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year. Provision has been made in the Estimates for further indexation in this regard. Similarly, in relation to the reckonable income limits, I intend to follow existing practice and increase these limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained.</P>
      <P>I will be reviewing the provisions of the student support schemes and any changes that I consider appropriate and feasible, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector, will be included in the student support schemes for the coming academic year.</P>

      <P>As part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a Grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels of the primary school.</P>
      <P>Requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education, and are also being considered by the working group set up to review the full-time pre-service teacher training courses.</P>

      <P>The registration council for secondary <Col N="1237" /> teachers regulates the qualifications required for teachers for appointment in secondary schools. The council does not take into account at present the accreditation of prior learning in terms of the necessary qualifications which are deemed to be a recognised degree with a higher diploma in education. In the case of community and comprehensive schools, while my Department acts as the official recognition body for teacher qualifications, the same conditions apply.</P>
      <P>Qualifications in the second level vocational sector are in accordance with Memorandum V7 where again a degree appropriate to the specific teaching post is required. In the case of vocational preparation and training and post-learning certificate courses, there is also provision for the acceptance of qualifications which would be acceptable in the colleges sector.</P>
      <P>The situation may arise under the national qualifications authority whereby the accreditation of prior learning may contribute in part to the acquisition of the necessary qualifications at degree level for appointment as a teacher. I would welcome such accreditation as part of a more flexible provision of educational opportunities.</P>

      <P>The Drumcondra English Profiles are related to the revised English curriculum and are structured around the areas of oral language, reading and writing. For each class level from junior infants to sixth class, and for each of the above three areas of language, a set of indicators of achievement has been designed, resulting in 24 indicator sets for the school.</P>
      <P>The indicators of achievement are statements that describe pupil achievement and are based on important content objectives in the revised English curriculum. Each set of indicators is ordered in terms of their relative difficulty. On the basis of the teachers' formal and informal observations, tests and records of pupil performance, pupils are rated against the indicators at the highest indicator at which s/he has demonstrated achievement over the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In devising the profiles, indicators of achievement in the three areas of language were identified for each class level by a panel of three teachers who were experienced in the teaching of English, and had expertise in the areas of curriculum development and assessment. Subsequently, a representative sample of teachers &ndash; 15 at each <Col N="1238" /> class level &ndash; were asked to arrange the indicators in each set in order of difficulty. The agreement of teachers was assessed statistically, and the resulting set of indicators was deemed to be representative of the curriculum in terms of the content of the indicators, and the order in which they appeared.</P>
    <P>The people who developed the profiles were employees of the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, and the terms of their contracts and recognition for their work is a matter for that centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capitation fee referred to by Deputy Shortall refers to the standardised charge levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, regis<Col N="1239" /> tration and student services. When introduced, this charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years. At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed. In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charge would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, it was accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year. In line with the 4% increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260 was accepted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the charge is not paid by students in receipt of grants.</P>
      <P>The universities further increased this charge by 7% to £278 for the current academic year and this increase was made without my predecessor's approval. Section 40 of the Universities Act, 1997, enables a university to determine and charge fees for student registration, courses, lectures, etc. The Higher Education Authority can review, with the universities, the fees charged by the universities and then, having consulted with me, the Higher Education Authority can advise the universities on the fees, which in its opinion, should be charged. Accordingly, there is no specific statutory requirement for the universities to seek the approval of the Minister for Education and Science for the increase in the student charge.</P>
      <P>In the light of the increase in the charge being levied by the universities, my predecessor agreed to an increase to £278 for the charge payable by students in the institutes of technology, however, this approval was on the basis that £8 of the increase would be specifically devoted to attrition-access initiatives in the individual institutions.</P>
      <P>Prior to this year, there was agreement as to the level of increase in the charge and my officials are engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities regarding an agreed procedure for reviewing fee levels in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has reviewed the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level institutions in relation to the student services charge. In the course of its review the authority obtained information in relation to the allocations from the charge and I am arranging with the authority for <Col N="1240" /> a copy of the relevant report to be furnished to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically to relieve some of the supply pressure for student accommodation by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector. Properties qualifying for relief under the scheme are campus areas of the educational institution, or areas, within an 8km radius of the main campus, which are approved by the educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place.</P>
      <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students and therefore I do not propose to intervene further at this stage.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available. The allocation of funding to capital projects depends on factors such as the rate of progress of architectural design, site acquisition, the granting of planning permission and the outcome of the tender competition. Delays can arise at any point in the process, consequently, it is not possible to say when projects being designed at present will proceed to construction.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy requires information on individual building projects, I will be happy to provide the details.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member <Col N="1248" /> states, including the United Kingdom, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying. It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid, in all circumstances, would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the relevant country in which the student was studying, at the prevailing exchange rate. My Department confirmed these arrangements in a letter of November 1996 to all local authorities and vocational education committees and a reminder was issued in December 1997. Indeed these arrangements are included in the terms of the annual higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While I appreciate the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling, I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>PLC courses offer integrated general education, vocational training and work experience for those who have completed senior cycle or equivalent.</P>
      <P>The drop out rates from post leaving certificate courses during 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 are 22.45%, 23.81% and 16.59% respectively. Of those who left the 1998-99 programme early, approximately half did so to take up employment or further education or training. Some 39.33% progressed to employment and 9.04% progressed to further education or training at the stage of leaving the course. The pattern of drop out has been consistent at around 23% for a number of years and the indications are that the 16.59% rate for 1998-99 is the result of incomplete statistical returns.</P>
      <P>Significant investment has been made in recent years in enhancing the quality and accessibility of these courses through the introduction of national assessment and certification under the National Council for Vocational Awards in 1994, the abolition of fees in 1995 and the introduction of a maintenance grant scheme for the first time in 1998.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall strategy to develop a range of alternative routes through which people can progress to higher education, a LINKS scheme has been introduced under which students with NCVA level two awards may progress from PLC courses to selected courses in institutes of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Overall, the latest survey undertaken nationally for outcomes from PLC courses one year after leaving, shows that all but 8.5% progress to employment or further training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the benefits of the programme in terms of increased maturity, enhanced study skills and reflective awareness of the realities of the workplace. The recently-published longitudinal study, carried out for the NCCA &ndash; National Council for Curriculum and Assessment by the ERC &ndash; Education Research Centre &ndash; on 1994 junior certificate students who sat their leaving certificate examination in 1997 provides useful evidence that, not only is the transition year programme proving its worth against its own criteria, it also enhances students' performance at leaving certificate level by 26 points, offsets the handicap of disadvantage and makes students more ready to attempt higher level papers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I consider that making the programme compulsory would be inadvisable. The notion of compulsion and obligation runs counter to the spirit of the transition year programme. Schools are free to design their own curriculum within broad parameters set down by my Department. They are also free to decide whether or not to offer the programme to their full cohort of fourth year students or to a sub-set of the cohort. The policy of my Department is to leave schools free also to choose the combination of programmes they offer to students. This may or may not include the transition year programme.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that new measures were introduced recently to ensure that there is appropriate educational provision in place for non-English speaking pupils at primary school level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary schools which have 15 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits will be automatically entitled to an additional temporary teacher for a period of up to two years. Schools with 35 or more such pupils will be entitled to two temporary teachers. Where two schools operate on one campus and have 15 or more such pupils they will be entitled to an <Col N="1250" /> additional temporary teacher on a shared basis. Schools eligible for additional teacher(s) will also receive a once-off grant of £200.</P>
    <P>Primary schools in which between four and 14, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled will receive grant assistance. Schools with between four and nine such pupils will receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 will receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. Schools with three or fewer such pupils are expected to provide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources.</P>
    <P>Managerial authorities of schools with non-national primary pupils enrolled who have significant English language deficits should submit an application for assistance to the primary branch of my Department.</P>
    <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the arrangements in relation to the allocation of teachers to cater for the education of refugees and asylum seekers will be subject to review. In addition, the refugee language support unit, established under the auspices of Trinity College, will be provided with a budget of the order of £1.2 million over the period of the programme to co-ordinate action for language tuition for refugees to assist them along the pathway to independent living. The unit's functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the refugee agency, FÁS and refugee groups themselves. In addition, refugees are among the groups catered for as part of the adult literacy programme provided by the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the supplementary panel for temporary teachers which is provided for in the redeployment scheme for lay teachers in Catholic secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is the result of an agreement between the religious-clerical authorities of the <Col N="1251" /> Catholic secondary schools and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland. An independent administrator is appointed by the parties to administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for admission to the supplementary panel, a temporary teacher must have taught for a minimum of 18 hours per week for two years or more in the same school or for three years or more in separate schools participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Changes to the terms of the scheme, including those relating to the supplementary panel, are a <Col N="1252" /> matter in the first instance for the parties to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The current arrangements for the operation of the supplementary panel for temporary teachers in primary schools provide that they may be granted panel rights when they have completed three years continuous service. The service may be given in different schools.</P>
    <P>The scheme was agreed following discussions between the managerial authorities of primary schools, the INTO and my Department. Any proposals to alter the current scheme would have to be considered by the parties and be approved by my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
