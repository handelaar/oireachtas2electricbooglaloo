      <P>The sudden and unexpected death of our friend and colleague, Michael Ferris, at a Western European Union meeting in Lisbon on Monday is a tragic loss for the entire Labour Party. I was shocked and devastated to lose such an esteemed colleague and a good friend. However, our loss does not compare to that which his family has suffered and must cope with in the coming weeks and months. In Michael, they have lost a loving husband, a caring father and above all, a real friend. On behalf of the membership of the Labour Party and the parliamentary party, I extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to his wife, Ellen, his daughters, Gráinne and Catherine and sons, Michael, Tom, Bernard and Gerard. I also offer my heartfelt sympathy to his mother, Mary, who I am sure, at the great age of 94, never thought she would outlive her son.</P>
      <P>Michael suffered a great loss in 1978 with the death of his first wife, Josie, the mother of five of his children but found great happiness again when he married Ellen and she gave birth to another daughter, Catherine. Michael's wife Ellen, like so many politicians' partners, was involved in every aspect of his political life as an adviser, mentor, guide and supporter. Ellen gave Michael unquestioning and loyal support throughout his career. As a team it was clear that Michael and Ellen had a loving relationship and it was fitting that Ellen should have been at Michael's side when he died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the people of south Tipperary, Michael's death is a huge blow. They have lost a dedicated and faithful public representative who always put the needs of his constituents first. Michael served the people of Tipperary as a councillor, Senator <Col N="796" /> and Dáil Deputy since he entered public life more than 30 years ago. At local level he served with distinction on the Tipperary South Riding County Council which he chaired twice, first in 1973 and again in 1981.</P>
    <P>He entered national politics in 1975 when he won a Seanad by-election. Incidentally, he beat me for that nomination. He served in the Seanad throughout the 1980s as leader of the Labour Party Seanad group and Deputy Leader of the Seanad. In 1989, Michael fulfilled his lifelong political ambition when he won a seat for the Labour Party in Tipperary South. He held that seat in the two subsequent elections. Michael was never going to let go of that seat. It was a testament to his fighting qualities that he retained the seat in 1992 and particularly in the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>As a TD Michael fulfilled many roles in the Oireachtas. He was chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs from 1995 to 1997 and his work in that committee was always imbued with his passion for European integration. Most recently, he served as chairman of the Joint Committee on Sport, Tourism and Recreation, a role he took to with characteristic gusto and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Michael displayed some of his finest abilities as a parliamentarian on Committee Stages of Bills. If he had a keen interest in a Bill, he would press his case strongly, as Ministers know to their cost. He was particularly proud of the fact that he held the record for the greatest number of Opposition amendments to a Bill accepted by a Minister. He achieved this considerable feat in December 1997 when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, accepted almost 100 amendments from Michael during what was, by all accounts, an enjoyable and good natured debate on the Taxes Consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>Michael's family was solid Labour Party. He was always passionate about the party and it was a particular privilege for him to be the Labour Party standard bearer in Tipperary South and Clonmel, the town in which the Labour Party was founded in 1912. Michael carried the Labour Party flag in its home during good times and bad with courage and pride. He served as vice-chairman of the Labour Party from 1979 to 1986. As many Members of the House will be aware, the Labour Party was experiencing some development difficulties during that period. As vice-chairman, Michael fulfilled his duties with great skill, tact and a sense of humour. Those were stormy years for the party and Michael played a central role in steering it through a difficult period of its history.</P>
    <P>Michael was a socialist and an internationalist. He believed passionately in the ideals of the labour movement worldwide. Through his extensive travel and work abroad he had many friends and contacts in numerous parliaments and in international organisations. I recall the occasion when I represented the Government at the funeral of Andreas Papandreou in Athens. I was ushered into a room for VIPs and introduced to the Pres<Col N="797" /> ident of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Clerides. His first comment, upon hearing that I was from Ireland, was: &ldquo;How is Michael Ferris?&rdquo;  Many colleagues in both Houses will have had a similar experience over the years.</P>
    <P>Michael had other passions and interests outside politics, which will be surprising to some people. One of them was beekeeping. Only last week he gave presents of his home made honey, with its unique flavour of Galtee heather, to some of his friends in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>My abiding memory of Michael is of his energy, his sense of fun and his sheer lust for life. He was a generous and warm friend who gave his all to the Labour Party. There was never a scintilla of doubt or a hint of equivocation in Michael about his commitment to the party. We have lost one of its finest members and we are all the lesser for it.</P>
    <P>Michael was a true Labour Party stalwart. We will miss him greatly. The thoughts, condolences and prayers of the Labour Party are with his wife Ellen and family at this very sad and tragic time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House join in this tribute and motion of sympathy on the death of the late Michael Ferris. We all mourn his passing. He is a great loss to his party, the House and, most of all, to his family, his wife Ellen, his mother, sons and daughters.</P>
      <P>He was an exceptionally decent, conscientious, and immensely hard working Deputy. We on this side of the House worked with him for several years. He worked very hard. The House comprises a number of Members who work hard on the floor of the House while others work equally hard, but not so much on the floor. Michael did both. He enjoyed the floor of the House. Deputy Quinn summed it up well. If he was into a Bill he gave it his all and held strong and passionate views. There was always a sense of fun about him. When he scored a good point he was happy to chuckle about it. He greatly enjoyed the cut and thrust of politics on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>He will be enormously missed by his constituents, both as a local representative and because of the work he did in this House for them, which I know they appreciate. In addition to representing well the interests of his South Tipperary constituency, he was an assiduous parliamentarian and played an active role on the committees of the House. Many of us believe the committees are of immense importance; perhaps others do not. Michael believed they were. He chaired many of them and was prepared to play a major role on them. He was active on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and, more recently, on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He played a very active role in European and international affairs as a member of the European socialist group and interparliamentary group. He took them very seriously. As Minister for Finance or as Taoiseach he appeared to be everywhere before me. He was not going around <Col N="798" /> the world taking life easy, but was representing the country. He was remembered wherever he went, which is more than most of us can say about some of these parliamentary blocks. Regardless of the language, people knew him and he made it his business to be known. I could name many places he visited, both popular and unpopular. He was known because he spoke up wherever he was. He did not merely attend as part of a delegation &ndash; he had his bit to say.</P>
    <P>He was a member of the Labour Party for a number of decades. He was vice-chairman of the party from 1979 to 1986, was Chief Whip and assistant Government Whip. He served in the Seanad during the 1970s and most of the 1980s. As a county councillor in Tipperary South Riding he served two terms in the Chair. He was also a member of numerous committees, including agricultural committees, many of which he chaired, the VEC and the South Eastern Health Board. He was a long time member of Tipperary UDC. He was immersed in the community and not too many things happened in which he was not involved. He was present and very active during any visit I made there as party leader.</P>
    <P>While the towns tend to claim the more numerous part of the electorate, the late Deputy Ferris, born in Bansha, came from a rural tradition in the Labour Party. He was always very keen to explain agricultural life. As the number of Deputies from rural areas declined over the years he was happy to explain the rural aspect to issues. I had to suffer that on a few Finance Bills when he lectured us about placing too much emphasis on business life and not enough on rural life. I remember a number of times he made long speeches about that on Bills with which I was involved.</P>
    <P>He was a moderate and non-ideological person but he showed great social concern rooted in strong moral and religious values. I pay tribute to the much appreciated contribution he made. I recall with gratitude the time I worked closely with him when the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party partnership Government was in place. I considered him a true friend and a person whose loss will be felt enormously.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government and the Fianna Fáil party, I extend our sympathies to the leader of and his colleagues in the Labour Party. I am conscious that this is the third time I have had to do that in the life of this Dáil which is less than three years old. That is a price which seems especially hard on a party so I sincerely extend those sympathies to his colleagues. It is hard on any party, large, small or in between, to lose that many members. As has been said many times, it reminds us in the House of the price people pay for the hard going of political life. That is a price the Labour Party has had to pay in a hard way in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government provided funding towards the establishment of the Ferris scholarship scheme in the NUI in Galway. The scheme is designed to ensure that a great diversity of <Col N="799" /> students participate in exchange programmes by bringing US students from disadvantaged backgrounds to the university for the year. Its establishment was promoted strongly by Deputy Michael Ferris. He discussed that with me a number of times together with his relations in the United States who provided the remainder of the substantial funding for this scholarship. He was passionate about it. I recall at least two conversations in which he said it would give a lead to getting more ordinary Joe Soaps into universities. It was his contribution. It is now up and running and, for years to come and because of his efforts, people from deprived, disadvantaged and marginalised backgrounds will receive an education.</P>
    <P>I offer my deep condolences to his wife, Ellen, his four sons and two daughters and his friends and colleagues who bear the greatest burden of this sad and tragic loss. I am told by my colleagues who were with him on Monday that his last comments were about the pride and satisfaction he received from the involvement of Irish troops working under the UN banner in Kosovo. He was immensely proud of that role and wanted that to be recorded. At a time when we have troops in so many parts of the world, he was a politician who was very involved internationally, gave of his time and ultimately died in service abroad. I refer to that because it was a contribution which my colleagues noted and they shared his pride in it. He apparently put it strongly and well on the day. Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam fíor-uasal agus go gcanfaidh Mícheál i measc na n-aingeal go deo. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>Our party leader, Deputy John Bruton, wanted to be present to pay tribute to his dear friend and former colleague, Michael Ferris. Unfortunately, Deputy Bruton had to be present in Lisbon on party business, which is ironic and coincidental, and I know he has expressed his apologies to Deputy Quinn for not being here.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I extend our sympathy on the untimely death of Michael Ferris to his wife, Ellen, to his sons and daughters, Gráinne, Michael, Tom, Bernard, Gerard and Catherine, to his mother, Mary, and to his sister, Josephine. I also pay tribute and extend sympathy on behalf of Fine Gael to Deputy Quinn, leader of the Labour Party, and to all Michael's colleagues in the Dáil, the Seanad and throughout the country. He was well known and loved by all Labour Party people throughout the country and by many others. It is a terrible loss for the Labour Party to have to see another of its members pass away in this manner.</P>
      <P>Michael was the embodiment of all that was decent and honourable in politics. Wherever he went, he left friends behind, be it at county council or health board level or in the Dáil or Seanad. He saw his role as first and foremost to represent the people of south Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His work for his constituents knew no time limits. He was an active member of many local <Col N="800" /> organisations and his knowledge of local issues was legendary. When he died, he was president of Bansha Agricultural Show Society and a member of the Bansha Musical and Dramatic Society and I shared many songs with him. He was influenced by his great hero and friend, Canon Hayes, who founded Muintir na Tíre. Canon Hayes's inspiration in his community work led Michael to get involved in political life as a way of delivering for his people of South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>In addition to his deep commitment to his beloved Bansha and South Tipperary, Michael also took a keen interest in European and world affairs. It is a coincidence that he lost his fight for life at a meeting on such matters.</P>
    <P>I was part of another dramatic period in Michael's life. I was with him in South Africa during the South African elections when he was sent from a distant part of the country to Cape Town to undergo a quadruple by-pass. I became close to him because I spent a lot of time in the hospital until his wife, Ellen, joined him. I saw how quickly he became known despite the fact he was wired to tubes and medical devices. Anytime I asked where the Irishman was, I was pointed in his direction because people in the hospital knew he was undergoing an operation. He made a tremendous recovery and he did not lose his good humour during that difficult time. I was glad he survived that and came back to serve the country for a number of years.</P>
    <P>As a Member with more than 20 years experience in the Dáil and Seanad, he saw many of his colleagues and friends come and go on the merry go round of politics. These people always considered him a friend.</P>
    <P>His repeated election was a measure of the strength and depth of the Labour Party's support in urban and rural Ireland. As a member of that party's smaller rural base, Michael will be sorely missed by the Labour Party. It is a cruel blow and a statistical improbability that the Labour Party has lost its third Deputy since the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I extend my deepest sympathy to Michael's wife, his children, his mother and his sister. We are all saddened by his untimely death. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and Deputies Owen and Quinn in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to Michael's wife, Ellen, his six children and the Labour Party. It is extraordinary that this is the third time in the short life of this Dáil that we are extending our sympathies on the death of a member of the Labour Party. As Deputy Owen said, it is almost an impossible statistic if one considers it as a proportion of its members. It is a big blow to the Labour Party because, as Deputy Quinn said, Michael was passionate about his politics but he was particularly passionate about the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> Michael led a full life. I attest to the fact he was well known internationally because on a recent visit to South Africa I met a man from Tipperary who asked me if I knew Michael Ferris. He said he did not know him because he left Tipperary many years ago but Michael stayed with the man and his family after his illness in South Africa. He told me that after Michael returned to Ireland a number of years ago he telephoned him every week to talk to him and they became great friends. That sums up the type of man he was. We all felt we were his friends. He had a very warm and vibrant personality and his innate decency was obvious to all who knew him. Two weeks ago we had a conversation about a matter in south Tipperary in which he was particularly interested. One always wanted to make a special effort to help him as one regarded him as a pal. That is not something we could all say about each other.</P>
    <P>When Members of the Oireachtas travel abroad they are always interested in who will accompany them. I never travelled with Deputy Ferris but he was a popular choice because he got on with everyone, he had a great sense of humour and a great love of life. To his wife, Ellen, I wish to say how sad and sorry we are at this loss and how deeply shocked we were to hear of Michael's sudden and untimely death. I also extend my sympathy to his children and to Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party who have lost a terrific party member and a man who was a close friend to us all.</P>

      <P>It is normal to only speak words of praise for a colleague on his death but it requires no effort to praise the late Deputy Michael Ferris. I can think of nothing bad to say about this thoroughly decent man. Different parties have political differences but to all in the Green Party Michael was always friendly, humorous and warm hearted. He was a true and hard working gentlemen and a very loyal gentleman and colleague to all in the Labour Party. On behalf of the Green Party I extend my sincere sympathy and prayers to Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party, but especially to Michael's family and many friends. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <P>I offer my sympathy to the Ferris family, to Michael's wife, Ellen, and to his four sons and two daughters. I also extend my sympathy to Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party. Michael joined me as a colleague through the Seanad in 1975. He had boundless energy and was consistent and persistent. Sometimes he could be annoying because of his intention and <Col N="802" /> diligence but he thoroughly researched any matter in which he was interested and was consistent in pursuing such matters. Michael had a tremendous sense of loyalty, particularly to south Tipperary and to Bansha and the Glen of Aherlow in west Tipperary where he always topped the poll in local elections. However, his deep concern over the past two years was not for his own health but for his mother, who was moved to a nursing home.</P>
      <P>Michael was a very fit man and often lectured me about my more pleasurable indulgent habits suggesting that I should follow his example. He is the third Labour Party Member of the Oireachtas to die but he is also the third Member from south Tipperary to die since 1968, following Paddy Hogan and Don Davern, so his death is a blow to the constituency as well as to the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Michael would have been happy to die with his boots on. He could not foresee a life of retirement and none of us could imagine him living such a life. He would always arrange a meeting for any night that one might be at home knowing we would all be available. I often thought that he scouted for meetings rather than arranging them. While we had many differences we worked together, particularly in the past two and a half years, for the benefit of Tipperary town where Michael lived and much of this work has come to fruition.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in south Tipperary I offer my sincere sympathy to Michael's wife, Ellen, to his family and to the Labour Party in the House and in Tipperary on this tragic loss.</P>

      <P>It is with deep sadness and great sorrow that I join the tributes to my constituency colleague and friend, Michael Ferris. While sharing 18 years of public life with Michael, I experienced the extraordinary enthusiasm and remarkable dedication of a truly devoted politician. As the representative of his constituents in south Tipperary, he was steadfast, determined and fearless in promoting and protecting their interests and well being. As a political colleague, he was decent and fair, helpful and kind. He was most generous with advice and we all know that Michael had much advice to give. He can be best described in very simple terms &ndash; he was a gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael was extremely proud to be elected to Dáil Éireann in June 1989, the same day as me. From then on Leinster House became his second home. His entire life was one of public service. His success can be attributed to one thing &ndash; his belief in his own ability. His political journey saw him climb every rung of the political ladder, from community involvement in his native Bansha to Tipperary Urban District Council to South Tipperary County Council, Seanad Éireann and then Dáil Éireann. He spoke of his native Bansha and the Glen of Aherlow as if they were a city but to him the area was a city. He was conscious that he <Col N="803" /> was following in the footsteps of one of Bansha's noblest sons, the late Canon John Hayes. Canon Hayes always said that where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows. It was this belief of his mentor that gave Michael his breathless enthusiasm for public life.</P>
    <P>He was a committed family man and spoke just two weeks ago about the desperate attempts all politicians must make to ensure a fair balance between public service and family life. Michael left us while carrying out the parliamentary duty he liked most &ndash; representing this Parliament and this country abroad. I am glad that, with his priorities in the right place, Ellen was with him on this, his last journey. It may be of comfort to all of us, if not daunting to know, that Michael is not alone in his new home, having joined three of our colleagues who have sadly left us since June 1997.</P>
    <P>When many of us meet tonight in Bansha, at the foot of the Galtee mountains and in the shadow of his beloved Glen of Aherlow, it will be with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we will follow Michael to his final resting place, his true home for the last 68 years. We all know that for Michael it is all over now but he can surely rest in peace because he served his people well, he cared for his family with endless devotion, he did us, his political colleagues, and the political profession proud. Above all, he showed such loyalty and endless love for his party, the Labour Party. None of us could find a better role model for ourselves and those who will follow us than Michael Ferris.</P>
    <P>I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to Ellen, to his family, to his elderly mother, to his colleagues and friends in the Labour Party and, indeed, to everyone in south Tipperary. For all of us, this is a desperate loss. I will always remember Michael with much affection.</P>

      <P>This refers to the complexity of Social Welfare Bills over the past six or seven years. We have had major consolidation in relation to the Finance Acts. The Taoiseach referred to the contribution of our late colleague, Deputy Michael Ferris, to one of those Bills in this Dáil. I referred on Committee Stage to the fact that we have 44 major schemes, possibly 45 with the carer's benefit. There is long-standing agreement that we should consolidate. We can start today by including a simple reference after line 13, in page 5.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of consolidation. In relation to social welfare, we are dealing with a very complex system. Every year efforts are made to simplify things. Then new schemes are added and matters become even more complex. In my early days in the Dáil, I was involved in a consolidation Bill, and there has been another one since. I would be keen to see regular consolidation. One of the difficulties is that many recipients of social welfare do not fully know their rights. That is contributed to by the fact that we have such a morass of legislation that it is difficult to ascertain fully those rights. That applies in particular to practitioners, those in advisory centres, Dáil Deputies, Senators and councillors who are doing their best to find their way through the legislation to advise their constituents. While the amendment proposed by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, does not involve consolidation of legislation, the spirit behind it is that we should make a further step towards an up to date consolidation Bill. I would be happy if the Minister agreed that an up to date consolidation Bill should be considered. He might put steps in train to ensure such a Bill is introduced in the near future.</P>

      <P>With regard to this amendment, there is no need for a collective citation because, as I said on Committee Stage, section 3(8) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 covers this issue. That subsection states &ldquo;References in any other enactment to the &ldquo;Social Welfare Acts&rdquo; means this Act and every enactment which is to be construed together with it as one.&rdquo;  In effect, this amendment is not required. I can give an undertaking to the Dáil that my Department will bring forward consolidating legislation. I do not know when it will be ready, but work on it has started in the Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for the differing commencement dates of social welfare and tax aspects of the annual budget.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to a report on the rationale for the differing commencement dates and raises one of the most irritating aspects of social welfare provision. On 6 April each year most citizens with incomes from the private or public sectors benefit from the taxation changes made in the budget. This year there was much controversy and lengthy discussion inside and outside the House on the taxation changes and several subsequent amendments were made by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. Most citizens expect increases in their incomes two or three weeks after the budget is announced.  However, social welfare recipients must wait a further month before they get their increases. The Minister trumpeted many of those increases including the increase in contributory pensions and the £7 increase for senior citizens. It is unfortunate that those recipients have to wait an extra month to gain the benefit of their increases.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Minister brought forward towards April the commencement date of budgetary provisions and he promised to ensure it will coincide with the commencement date for tax changes from the budget in 2001. A significant number of increases in benefits, including the increase in child benefit will not come on stream until September, when the parents of school going children incur most expenses. Therefore, significant changes in child benefit will not be introduced until late this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> While the provision for carers is positive, they will have to wait until at least October to benefit from it. The Minister was not clear about that provision. Have we to await the introduction of amending legislation from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney? The total addition involved in moving the date forward to April to coincide with the tax changes would be approximately £20 million. I urge the Minister to do this for the 1.5 million citizens who are primarily dependent on social welfare. Many of these claimants paid significant amounts into the system over the years in social insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrast arising from the last budget between a married couple who are earning a total of £100,000 between them and a married couple where the husband is disabled and both are unable to work as a consequence is startling. The couple earning £100,000 will gain £77 a week from the last budget and this additional benefit will come on stream from 5 April. However, the household where the husband is disabled will gain £7 a week, including £4 for the person on disability assistance and £3 for the qualified adult dependant. There is a difference of £70 a week between the two.</P>
      <P>A further difference is that the benefits for the well off couple will come on stream in April while the modest increases available to the household with the disabled person will not come on stream until May. The Minister will pat himself on the back and say that social welfare increases in the past came into effect later in the year. However, I do not accept that argument. There is so much money available at present that the continuing restriction on the payment of increases to those on social welfare has no validity whatsoever. The example I mentioned highlights this point.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of approximately £20 million mentioned by Deputy Broughan is correct. Given that the increases are modest in the context of the moneys that are available, they should be paid at least from the beginning of the tax year in the same way as the benefits to taxpayers will flow from that time. This is why I tabled the amendment. The Minister should take into account the case made by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the function of the Opposition to highlight defects in the system and, in terms of social welfare matters, the extent of problems and poverty in society. The Minister's reaction to this aspect may at times be similar to that of a duck to heavy rainfall. However, he should take on board the latest report of the Combat Poverty Agency on child poverty which confirms everything we have been saying over the past year about this matter. It confirms the extent of poverty in society and highlights the need for action in that regard. The Minister can take that action. We will deal later with the modest increases in child benefit, but those increases will not even come into effect until next October. When there is independent verified confirmation of the extent of poverty in <Col N="809" /> society and an acceptance that one of the major ways to deal with it as far as children are concerned is through the child benefit system, the Minister should be prepared to take into account the Opposition's suggestion of at least paying the modest increases from April. That is the best we can do in regard to these amendments which represent one last plea to the Government to soften its position on this issue. While I welcome the fact that the payments of the weekly increases have been brought forward to May, it is really only a job half done as all increases should be payable from April.</P>

      <P>In recent decades, Governments, due to recessionary pressures, have tended to push back the effective payment dates of social welfare increases in order to maximise the money available to them in the budget year. Since taking up office, this Government has reversed that trend. In the past two budgets, I brought the increases forward by two weeks from the 29 weeks paid by the previous Government to 31 weeks. In other words, people were being paid for 31 weeks under this Government as opposed to 29 weeks during the reign of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>This year, we brought the payments forward by an extra four weeks; the budget increases announced in December will be paid for 35 weeks of the initial year. We committed ourselves in the budget to go even further in next year's budget which will effectively result in social welfare increases in that year being aligned with the effective date for tax increases, namely 5 April. By this time next year, this issue will no longer be relevant because the Government will have delivered on its commitment to bring social welfare payments forward to 5 April.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of bringing forward the general increases to 6 April would be £20 million and the additional cost of bringing forward the implementation date for child benefit increases to April would be £44 million. Over the years, child benefit increases were implemented in September in order to give parents a boost as children returned to school. Obviously, parents will receive the full increase from the year September to September and will also be entitled to whatever increases occur thereafter.</P>
      <P>This Government has reversed the trend set down by previous Governments which, owing to limited fiscal resources, were obliged to push back the effective date in the budget year. On the one hand, we are being accused of being inflationary while on the other we are being accused of failing to spend all the money with which Deputy O'Keeffe alleges the Government is awash.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that, over the past three or four years, the operative date of all income changes has moved towards the first weekend in April. However, there is a double standard and hypocrisy on the part of the Government in regard to this matter. Some months ago, the Minister for Finance made a fundamental change in regard to capital acquisitions tax which will cost in the region of £46 million. The people who will be affected by that change already have, by definition, major income resources as they are in a position to sell shares and move capital around to their best advantage. The Government is prepared to facilitate those high earners at a cost of £46 million yet it will not provide a much smaller sum of £20 million for the poor. This draws attention to the harsh, almost monetarist, approach of the Government to these matters. I appeal to the Minister to bring all social welfare increases back to 5 April.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall not later than 6 months after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the measures required to close the differential between the rates of periodical benefits and rates of periodical social assistance paid to a beneficiary and the rates paid to a qualified adult.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the core problems of social welfare provision is the fact that dependants receive less than 70% of the main rate of benefit or assistance. As I said on Committee Stage, some dependant benefits are appallingly low for adults to live on, particularly the key unemployment assistance rate of £47, which has been increased from £43.20. Given the recent improvements in the economy, the Government should be ashamed to offer any citizen £47 as a basic income. The new non-contributory pension of £51.70 is appallingly low, as are the better invalidity benefit and contributory pension rates of £58.30 and £60.20, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this matter at length at Question Time when the Minister said the previous benchmark was 60%. However, all parties have had extensive discussions with the voluntary sector <Col N="811" /> and groups such as CORI and the Seniors' Parliament who are demanding a minimum 70% rate. The Minister said he will implement this over three years. However, given our economic progress, this is a ludicrous time frame. The Minister should have offered the 70% rate this year. The ultimate issue which the Minister should address is individualisation of social welfare payments. For the past few years, Deputies on these benches have pressed the Minister to look at this issue. This year, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government acted decisively on tax individualisation. However, there has been little movement on our request for individualisation of social welfare benefit. The Minister has taken baby steps on the important issue of the low level of dependant allowances when he should have taken more decisive action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, this amendment deals with the position of women in society, particularly those whose spouses are in receipt of social welfare. Qualified adult dependants are usually women at home whose husband loses his job or becomes disabled. This amendment deals with the core issue of how much we value the role of women which is why I am so supportive of it. The amendment also relates to the thorny issue of individualisation which has considerable resonance following the turmoil of the last budget. It is accepted that two people living together can live more cheaply and that 70% should be paid to a second adult in a household. Why is this not being paid? It is not because of money as the Minister has that. He referred to inflation &ndash;  no independent economist would suggest that the poor or payments to them are creating inflation. The danger of inflation is not a defence in rejecting our suggestion that the 70% rate should be given to qualified adult dependants.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to come up with some other excuses. If it does not cause inflation and he has the money, why does he not pay it? There is no political will to accept the case being made or advice from the independent group established by the Minister to examine the treatment of married and co-habiting couples and one parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group unequivocally recommended the figure of 70%. Why do we not pay it? The Minister has not given an adequate answer. The only reason I can see is that the position of women in our society, who are affected by this, is not an issue as far as this Government is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Political insults may be made but I remind Deputies that when their parties were in Government, the Commission on Social Welfare recommended a 60% rate. The fine words about how women in the home and spouses should be paid in their own right were not put into practice when Deputy O'Keeffe's party was in Government. The benchmark of 60% was set then and it was left to us to achieve that when we entered office, which we quickly <Col N="812" /> did. However, we were not prepared to stop there. We established a working group to examine how we could improve on the 60% rate and it recommended an increase to 70%.</P>
      <P>The Government and I reject Deputy O'Keeffe's assertion that there is no political will on this issue. The Government is ahead of any suggestions by the Opposition. After the report was published, we quickly decided that we would reach the level of 70% over three budgets and we started doing so in this Bill by giving increases above the rate of inflation, from 8% to 17%. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct that the working group examined individualisation of social welfare, on which it could not agree. However, it was in favour of reaching the 70% rate. When this is reached, we will hopefully move towards the 100% rate over a period. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct that costs are lower for two people living together; this was researched by the working group. They looked at the individualisation issue and recommended that the existing arrangements for separate payments be made available on a more general basis. This would involve implementing a general scheme of administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of a qualified adult allowance direct to the person concerned, something of which I am in favour. This would involve complex social issues which must be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of a qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. Working groups will be established under the programme, first, to produce proposals to progress the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system and, second, to provide proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance model which will facilitate combining work and family responsibilities in the context of changing work and social patterns.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the PPF to establish working groups to examine this issue. As far as I am concerned, the Government made a commitment in the original Programme for Government to bring forward proposals in relation to pensions for women in the home who took time off work for caring duties. I am fully committed to bringing forward proposals to ensure that women in those circumstances will qualify for pensions in their own right, something they could not do previously. The Government is committed to that. We are doing it on an incremental basis and in consultation with the social partners. As a result, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The necessary research will be carried out by the working groups which are to be set up in conjunction with the social partners under the new programme.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, I calculated that had the Minister opted for the 70% rate this year, the dependent recipient would receive £54.25 in the case of long-term unemployment assistance or £60 in the case of non-contributory old age pension. Those amounts, in an economy that will be worth 100 billion euros in 2000, are not lavish. I appeal to the Minister to move to the 70% rate this year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a statement on the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the period of 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000, within seven days of the publication of the relevant figures by the Central Statistics Office, and the statement shall compare the increase in the rates specified in Schedule A and Schedule B over the rates specified in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 in percentage terms with the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the said period.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the level of social welfare increases this year and to the fact that so much of the benefit of such increases can be lost as a result of spiralling inflation. There have been lengthy discussions in the House with the Minister on indexation, the subject of amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent necessity for a benchmark for the application of social welfare increases but the Minister has been unwilling to establish it. In recent speeches he has spoken of the amounts by which he increased social welfare payments but he has been unwilling to reference those increases to incomes in the booming economy. Amendment No. 6 is based on an amendment which was put down by my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, a couple of years ago which urged the Minister to monitor the effects of inflation and to ensure that social welfare recipients, the most vulnerable section of society, are protected from huge price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Minister has claimed credit for increases ranging from 5.2% to 5.7% across the 44 schemes. However, they coincide with a major <Col N="814" /> inflationary spiral in the economy. The recent disturbing report from the CSO puts inflation at more than 4% and we are told that if we measured it in the same way as the other 14 member states, it would now be at least 4.6%. If one gives an increase of 5.2% and inflation is running at 4.6% it amounts to a small increase. That is the fundamental problem this Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, must address.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have heard even more disturbing comments. The chief economist of Davy Stockbrokers says he expects an inflation rate this year of 7% across the services sector. People on social welfare use services as much as people on incomes in the private and public sector so a 7% inflation rate would be most disturbing. The Taoiseach and the Minister have assured people at various meetings that the inflationary spiral will be brought under control and taper down to 2.5%. Looking at the housing market and the services sector, however, one must be deeply concerned that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>The amendment asks the Minister to monitor this matter carefully to ensure that people on social welfare will get a genuine increase in real terms. There is little point in the Minister referring to the events of recent years because we are in a new type of economy. Fundamental changes in the energy markets and elsewhere make it impossible to predict what will happen.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 deals with benchmarking. A plethora of research and studies in recent years have urged the establishment of a benchmark. Before the introduction of the budget, the Minister was urged by Share the Wealth Campaign, CORI and other dedicated interest groups for people on social welfare to consider the 50% of median income benchmark. The Labour Party calculates that if the Minister had done that, the basic rate would now be £85.50 per week instead of £77. The current rate is significantly below even the modest benchmark of 50% of median income.</P>
    <P>There are other groups, however, which believe the benchmark should be referenced to average household income or even the average industrial wage. The problem I and my party have with this Minister is that he will not give leadership on this issue. He is the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs but he is not prepared to say: &ldquo;This will be the benchmark; this is what the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government will do and we will hang everything else on it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have asked him for the past 18 months to offer some guidelines. The average industrial wage, for example, is now approaching £9 per hour. There was an interesting discussion on it during the debate on the National Minimum Wage Bill. Seniors are seeking a benchmark of 34% of the average industrial wage for contributory old age pensions. That is significantly higher than the Minister's much vaunted target of £100 per week. There is no point in plucking figures <Col N="815" /> from the air, be it in respect of senior citizens, people on unemployment assistance or on invalidity benefit. The figures should relate to average incomes. It is good to see 20 and 24 year old men and women in our constituencies earning £400 week. It is a welcome development and we are delighted for them and for the success of our education system and the economy which is permitting it. However, we cannot then expect somebody who has worked for 40 years to live on an income of less than £100 per week. This is to offer them a tiny share of the benefits of the economy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give guidance to this House and lead the Government in the area of social welfare. He should establish a benchmark against which future social welfare rates will be based. To do it on the basis of median incomes, as requested by the Share the Wealth campaign and others, would be a first step. However, the Minister has lamentably failed in this Bill to establish even the most modest of benchmarks. He should execute his office in the way it is meant to be executed and tell us what is his proposed benchmark.</P>

      <P>These amendments focus on the issue of inflation, which is the enemy of the poor. The poor do not create inflation and payments to the poor do not contribute to it, yet the poor will suffer the consequences of inflation. One of the biggest defects of the Government is its inability to cope with inflation. Its policies are contributing to inflation. We now have the highest inflation rate in the EU, something of which we cannot be proud.</P>
      <P>Inflation is not merely an economic statistic, it affects everybody. The increase of £4 per week proposed to social welfare recipients will be of little use if it is eroded by inflation. It will be worse for those recipients who smoke because the increase in the price of cigarettes will more than offset their increased benefit. That price increase alone has contributed 0.5% to the inflation rate. I am a reformed smoker and am now an anti-smoker and will take any reasonable steps to discourage people from smoking. The impact on inflation of the price increase on cigarettes should have been neutralised by price reductions in other areas.</P>
      <P>The Government appears to be washing its hands of this problem. Its approach appears to be based more in hope than expectation that the rate of inflation will tail off by the end of the year, although it will still be the highest in the EU. It is soldiering on in the face of clear signs of danger, not only in Europe but in the world. There is the problem of oil price volatility, although it does not affect the economy as much as it used to. There is also huge volatility in America, especially on the stock markets, increasing interest rates and the continuing weakness of the euro against the dollar. The Government appears not just to be helpless in the face of inflationary trends&mdash;</P>

The result in terms of social welfare means that those trying to survive on very modest means, derived from social welfare, will be the worst affected. That is why I support these amendments. The Government should have a true appreciation of the impact of its policies, or non-policies, on inflation in as far as they apply to those who are trying to survive on social welfare. There is a major weakness on the part of the Government here because it does not even know what is happening.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputies on the other side of the House that in 1995, when their parties were in Government, the CPI was 2.5% while the budget increase allocated to social welfare was 2.5%, which resulted in a nil increase to social welfare recipients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>By contrast, last year the rate of inflation was 1.6% while the budget increases allocated to social welfare by the Government ranged from between 4.3% and 7.2%, a real increase in social welfare payments of between 2.7% and 5.5%. The increase for pensioners was even higher at 7.2%.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan may have been correct to say we should not look back too far. I will look back to this time last year when Deputy De Rossa, among others, spoke up the inflation rate. He suggested that the inflation rate for 1999 would be between 6% and 7%. Some leading commentators suggested then that inflation would be in double figures. Inflation for last year was 1.6%, lower than the expected rate of 2% on which the social welfare budget was based. Had the rate been 2.5% some Deputies would be complaining that those in receipt of social welfare would not have got as much as they expected. Nevertheless, they were well buffered from any eventual increase in the CPI and the real increase they secured was even better than that forecast by the Department of Finance and my Department. The social welfare rates increased from between 4% and 8.3% from the beginning of June 1999, which effectively meant that social welfare recipients enjoyed increases of between 2.4% and 6.6%. Deputy Broughan did not refer to the £7 increase for pensioners, which represents an increase over last year's payments of between 7.9% and 8.9%. The increase of £4 per week represents an increase over last year of between 5.2% and 5.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted by independent commentators that while the CPI will be somewhat high in the initial months of this year it will taper off later in the year. It is expected that the consumer price <Col N="817" /> index over the year will be about 3%. In effect, social welfare recipients will still be well ahead of expectations in that their real increases will range from 2.1% to 5.7%. For QAAs, these increases will range from 7.7% to 17.2% representing real increases, if the 3% is deducted, of 4.6% to 13.8%. We can only speak for our tenure, and in that we have given social welfare payments well ahead of the rate of inflation, something the Deputies present cannot say they did when their parties were in office a few short years ago.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that there are a number of exceptional circumstances which have led to the consumer price index increasing in the first few months of this year. The Government took a decision to increase the price of tobacco which it knew at the time would have implications for the consumer price index in the first few months of this year. We did that for good, health related reasons to raise additional funds from the tobacco industry to invest in much needed cardiac treatment and research. That was something on which we took a decision for good reasons.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is based on an agreed assumption between all partners that the inflation rate over the period of the programme will be between 2% and 2.5%. Obviously there are mechanisms to review that. It is accepted that, over the period, we will have underlying low inflation. I do not accept the argument of Deputies opposite that the Government is not doing something about inflation. We agreed the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and are strong supporters of the social partnership programme, something of which the Deputies opposite in varying forms were not in favour over the years. I gathered over the past few sessions that Deputy Broughan was not a supporter of the programme. However, I am glad to see a substantial amount of the trade union movement is coming out in favour of the programme. I hope it is put in place. I agree strongly with the comments in <i>The Irish Times </i>today of Father Seán Healy who is a strong supporter of the programme agreed between the Government and the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the issue of inflation as regards social welfare recipients. Last year social welfare recipients did better in the increases than was anticipated but as was expected by the Department of Finance. People should guard against unwarranted comments which could lead to a situation where there might be a run of inflation. The comments made by Deputy De Rossa and others last year were unfounded and that will be the same this year. However, inflation is something on which the Government will obviously have to keep a close eye.</P>

I support the <Col N="818" /> basic ideal and had seen it work effectively at local level long before I entered the House. I was involved in that type of development. However, I have grave concerns about the level of pay increases in the context of projected inflation rates and the movement towards the euro where we have lost control of monetary policy and the emphasis is on fiscal policy.</P>

      <P>We are experiencing grave difficulties in that economic conditions which suit huge economies such as Germany and France do not necessarily suit ours. That is something we must monitor closely in the coming months.</P>
      <P>There is a review mechanism for the pay increases under the programme. Trade union leaders recently made the point clearly and rightly before they entered their conference that there is a review mechanism if inflation goes out of control. The issue is that we are discussing social welfare recipients. As far as I am aware, they do not have a review mechanism whereby in September or October we can request the Minister to introduce another social welfare budget to cover inflation. There is nothing like that for social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned CORI, Father Healy and the fourth pillar of the voluntary sector in the programme. There are worthwhile aspirations in that segment to which the Government is committed. However, the key issue is that, if inflation increases, and the Minister agreed it is being increased for different reasons, such as the energy reason which did not exist last year, and it significantly increases along the lines many economists believe it will, there is no review mechanism for social welfare recipients. The only action that can be taken is for the Minister to at least give us some guidance as to how he would cope if, during the year, people received increases which turned out to be well below the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The Minister should talk to our constituents, any woman or man exiting a supermarket with groceries or pulling out of a petrol filling station, and ask them if, in the past two to three months, there has not been significant inflation in the economy because there has been and there is no question about it. The 4.6% estimate is too low and the increases the Minister gave this year of 5.5% are ludicrously low in the context of such significant inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not address amendment No. 10. We have had the reports on the reform of the tax and social welfare system. It is up to Government to decide. We need to have a basic index to which we can relate social welfare benefits and assistance increases. It is no use talking of £150 a week for seniors, as the Minister did at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis. While that would be good, if the average industrial wage were £600 a week, then it would be only one quarter of the average indus<Col N="819" /> trial wage. The Minister must address this issue because it is one of the core and fundamental issues for which his Department has responsibility to the House. I urge him to adopt the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not address the second issue and I will address it quickly. As regards social inclusion generally, in the previous partnership programme, the Government of which the Deputy's party was a member committed to spending £225 million on social inclusion measures over the three year period. We delivered on the vast majority of that but we went further. We delivered over £1 billion, which is way above what was agreed in the partnership programme. In the two years and nine months of the new partnership programme, we will increase that to £1.5 billion, which is three times the amount of money the previous Government dedicated two and a half years ago to social inclusion measures and that £1.5 billion is in a shorter period.</P>
      <P>If I were to make benchmarks, I could be accused by the social partners of setting my own targets and, to a certain extent, that criticism would be justified in that I would not be doing it in connection with partnership. For example, some time ago I and my Department decided that we would indicate new targets for NAPS. The social partners were in contact quickly to say they were not consulted. As far as I am concerned they should be consulted. The Government discussed the benchmarking of social welfare payments with the social partners in the negotiations on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and we agreed to set up a working group with an independent chairman. Once the agreement is put in place, the terms of reference will be brought forward in consultation with the social partners. It is hoped the working group will complete its task by April 2001.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Broughan agrees it would be inappropriate for me to second guess the deliberations of the working group which will examine this issue. The Department will be represented on that working group. The Deputy cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin, tabled similar amendments in recent years because she was concerned that many of the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts had not been implemented. On Committee Stage the Minister referred to the actuarial review of section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, the new sickness allowance scheme under Part IV of that Act, section 26(1) of that Act, section 10(4) of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, in relation to how a divorced person may receive a qualified adult allowance in respect of more than one person, section 22 of the Social Welfare Act, 1995, in relation to standardising arrangements which apply to various social welfare schemes and section 20 of the Social Welfare Act, 1994.

      <P>All the sections of the Social Welfare Act, 1999, have been commenced. There are some provisions from earlier Social Welfare Acts for which commencement orders have not been made. Section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, which provides for actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund to be undertaken on a five yearly basis will be commenced later this year. Part IV of the Social Welfare Act provides for a new sickness allowance scheme. When this scheme was proposed we had difficulties with the technological changes required. All those who would have qualified for a sickness allowance are being catered for through other payments; they are not losing out. In the meantime we decided to carry out a review of all the sickness payment schemes and we will examine it again when that review is complete.</P>

    <P>Section 26(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Social Welfare Act contains regulatory powers to prescribe the provisions relating to benefit and privilege in the context of means assessment.

Nothing has been done on that because to date no cases have come forward. If that changes, we <Col N="821" /> will look at it. That provision was included at the time to protect such a situation if it arose.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Social Welfare Act, 1995, provides regulatory powers designed to standardise the arrangements that apply to various social welfare schemes in relation to absence from the State. It is planned to introduce the relevant regulations later this year.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Social Welfare Act, 1994, provides for the integration of occupational injury benefit and employability supplement payable under the benefits scheme with disability benefit. The overall role of occupational injury benefit payments will be included in the review of the sickness and disability schemes this year.

      <P>4.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the social welfare situation of persons resident in Ireland who are in receipt of pensions under the social security legislation of any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the report on the social welfare situation of persons resident in Ireland who are in receipt of pensions under the social security legislation of another jurisdiction. This matter was brought to my attention during the year by Deputies Seán Ryan and O'Shea. In one case a person on a British rail pension did not qualify for the living alone allowance or the over 80 allowance, although they qualified for the other free schemes. There is also a problem with means testing because of the strength of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro and the punt. There has been a negative impact on the incomes of a number of people who retired to this country because the Department is assessing their means based on the fluctuations between the euro and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about people, particularly British people, who retire to this country and are excluded from the living alone allowance even if they live alone. We could adopt a nationalist stance and say it is their problem if they decide to live here. However, I do not share that view. We should have an open door policy for people retiring to this country and encourage them to live here. Many people left this country when they were young to earn a living in the UK and they have now retired here on UK pensions. <Col N="822" /> It is wrong to exclude people in this category from the living alone allowance. If their income level is such they should be allowed to qualify for the payment.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister referred to the living alone allowance as being an integral part of the pension system and stated that we have to comply with obligations under EU legislation. I accept these facts but that is not my point. I am not suggesting that we adopt a progressive approach to comply with EU obligations. If retired people are living on pensions not paid for by the Irish Exchequer we should be prepared to extend to them the same benefits, such as free fuel, the living alone allowance and so on, which are applicable to those who came through the Irish pension system. I hope the Minister will give an assurance to examine this issue this year. I am aware of cases of genuine need of which the Minister should take account, and I would be happy if he gives an undertaking to examine this issue with a view to dealing with it in the next budget.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is aware of cases of dire need I would ask him to forward the details to me and I will undertake to have them examined. People involved in such cases are entitled to non-contributory benefits. I can go no further than reiterate what I said on Committee Stage in that the living alone allowance is an integral part of the pension system. We are complying with EU regulations and could be accused of going outside those regulations if we granted this request.</P>
      <P>As regards the means test and currency exchange rates, a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners receive British pensions and it would not be practical to assess entitlement to non-contributory pensions each time the currency rate changes. Accordingly, prior to 1 January 1999, when determining the value of social security payments made in other EU currencies for the purpose of assessing a claimant's means, the Department employed an exchange rate mechanism used within the EU for social security transactions between member states. Since 1 January 1999 the conversion rates are fixed for countries participating in EMU. This exchange rate mechanism continues to be used for non-participating countries, including the UK, and is provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation EEC 574/72 on social security for migrant workers. The rate represents the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of the quarter for use in all transactions during the course of the succeeding quarter.</P>
      <P>It has been the Department's practice to use the rate of exchange which is most beneficial to the pensioner between the rate at the time the review commenced or the rate at the time the decision is made. We accept that, because of currency fluctuations, people feel they are losing out. However, we can only give the value of our pension at a particular time and that is what we do.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Not less than 3 months after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the extent of child poverty in the country and on the feasibility, in the context of the surplus funds in the Exchequer, of increasing child benefit to £25 per week for children under 5 years and by 25 per cent for children over 5 years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment focuses on child poverty. When dealing with this issue on Second and Committee Stages we did not have the independent verification which is now available. This verification comes from the Combat Poverty Agency which is within the Department's ambit. There is considerable child poverty despite all the signs of economic activity and wealth. We should be ashamed of this fact but, more importantly, as politicians we should be doing something about it. We are in a position to do something about child poverty but we are not doing so.</P>
      <P>This amendment focuses on child benefit as all independent commentators accept that increasing child benefit is the most effective way of dealing with child poverty. I agree with this assertion but have come to the view that in the near future we will have to return to the issue of child dependant allowances. This is a separate issue but, because of changes which have taken place, we must question the thinking that there should be a cap on such allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing child benefit is the most effective way of dealing with child poverty. The Minister will tell us of the great job he has done this year in comparison to previous years when there was less money available. However, that is not the issue. Giving an extra few pounds per week in child benefit from next September will not make the necessary impact on child poverty. We have to be far more realistic in our approach. This will cost a lot of money but the issue is the priority we are giving to children. If we are not giving them priority then we should say so. If the money <Col N="824" /> is available it is either being put away, which has some merits, or it is being spent in other areas. We must give a higher priority to children and that is why I support the approach originally suggested by Deputy John Bruton of giving £25 per week for children under the age of five. When this was suggested the Minister raised the step down factor but that can be overcome by providing a 25% increase in the rate for children over five years of age.</P>
    <P>We must focus on this issue. It is easy to talk about monthly payments and so on. In yesterday's UK budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave increases in child benefit but it has weekly payments. We will have to start thinking along the same lines as we now have the money to do so. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Child poverty is at the heart of many of the social problems we face, particularly in the most disadvantaged areas. On Committee Stage and during a recent Question Time it was pointed out that eleven of the 12 most disadvantaged areas in the country are in Dublin, the remaining one being on the north side of Cork city. The Minister stated that 25 areas will be targeted in the PPF which, I presume, will include the 12 areas to which I referred. Child poverty is a core element of deprivation in each of those areas. Before the budget, Deputy Shortall produced a pre-budget paper on behalf of the Labour Party, A Better Deal for Children and Families, which called for a basic increase of £10 per month for the first and second children. The Minister failed to reach even this modest target. In amendment No. 13 we call again for an additional parental payment of £20 per week for children under five years of age and £10 per week for six to 14 year olds. Those proposals would offer significant financial support to all families, particularly those living in poverty. They suggest a dramatic change of approach to that of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that such proposals would cost a significant amount of money &ndash; up to £500 million. In the context of the size of the social welfare budget and the development of the economy, £500 million would be a small price to pay for the fundamental support which would then be granted to our children.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party called for a national network of child care task forces with a budget of at least £30 million to ensure access to pre-school and child care facilities. We also called for reform of the tax and welfare systems to create incentives for two parent families. That is a key issue which the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs has attempted to address on a number of occasions and to which it will return. The Labour Party also requested making available £20 million for family support and child protection services.</P>

    <P>We came up with a comprehensive approach but the Minister is proceeding on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in one of the core areas of his responsibility. I ask <Col N="825" /> him to examine this again. We all met many of the voluntary groups working in the child care sector. Once the impact of the budget was appreciated, it was sad to see the disappointment among those groups. The Minister raised the hopes of those involved in child care but then he and the Minister for Finance dashed those hopes in their responses.</P>
    <P>This is an area which the Labour Party will address in a future Government. We would have to wait a long time for this Minister to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the proposed increases. They are totally inadequate. The most critical years are the initial years and the State could make a huge investment in future generations by supporting parents, particularly those rearing families on £42 per month. That amount is nowhere near enough. A box of premium baby food costs £9 and a packet of disposable nappies costs £8. It is recommended that children up to three years of age should be fed premium baby food but most parents stop after one year because of the cost.</P>
      <P>The best accountant in any home is the mother but even they face difficulties when they are only given £42 per month for footwear, clothing and other essentials for growing children. By accepting the amendment calling for a payment of £25 per week, the Minister would give parents an assurance that the Government is investing in the future of their children.</P>
      <P>Child care is an area of huge importance. The Government has clearly indicated that developers can invest in crèche facilities. We should, however, support those who need most help &ndash; the parents. They are the best carers and, given adequate support, could solve many of the problems in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This year there was an increase of £106 million, or 25%, in the child benefit budget, bringing the total bill to £575 million. Anyone who says that a Government which increases child benefit by 25% in one year, the largest increase in the history of the State, is not making an investment in children is talking nonsense. This Government is dedicated to increasing child benefit exponentially and, with the social partners, we have made a commitment to increase child benefit and move toward a figure of £100 for the third and subsequent children over the period of partnership. That will require substantial investment over the next two years and nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage about the proposals made by Deputies. I accept they have a view about the payment of child benefit for children under five and those over five. Targeting under fives would cause huge difficulties for families. A family with three children aged two, three and four would lose a substantial amount of money per week as each child reaches five years of age. The reduction would <Col N="826" /> continue over a three year period and it would represent a huge reduction in weekly income over that time. I have children and I know they do not become any less expensive once they reach the age of five, they become more costly. Deputies have revised their proposals about under fives and are now saying a payment should be made for children between five and 12 years of age. Again, when children reach 12 they become even more expensive.</P>
    <P>The Department and I have closely examined payments to families for children. The best method of targeting those at the lower end of the scale with young children is through the child benefit route. It is universal and goes, usually, to the female spouse. By using the scatter-gun approach suggested here it would be much more costly. It would be much easier to give a substantial payment to everyone with children under five with smaller increases for those with children over five but it would be wrong. We have already examined the differential between CDAs and child benefit and recognise that it will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I received the Combat Poverty Agency report this week. It proposes to provide a self-financing universal child care subsidy of £32.50 per month, which is not a huge amount of money. It states &ldquo;self-financing&rdquo; and goes back to its original proposal &ndash; if I am reading it correctly &ndash; in which it proposes that this additional £32.50 per month child care element in universal child care should be fully funded by restructuring the tax and welfare treatment of households. This would be an additional £100 child benefit as proposed. It advocated restricting the transferability of bands between married couples and directing the resources in an enhanced child benefit for families with children.</P>
    <P>In effect, it is moving towards something for which the Minister for Finance was roundly criticised, that is, individualisation and restricting the tax bands. One of the moves made by this Government, which I am prepared to defend, is moving to individualisation which takes into account the many working couples who have child care costs. My area of responsibility is child benefit and, in this year's budget, I have provided a 25% increase in child benefit payment. It is a universal payment to every family.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point that I could have used that £106 million to provide a larger payment to children under five years but that would have been the wrong way to go because it would disadvantage people with older children. We should substantially increase child benefit between now and the end of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in which there is a commitment to make progress to reach a level of £100 for the third and subsequent child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from where the Minister is coming. We always pride ourselves on being family conscious. We encourage families and believe the family is the basic unit of society <Col N="827" /> under our Constitution and according to our general thinking. We have this notion that we are prepared to do anything to encourage the concept of family. To a degree, that notion is fraudulent unless we are prepared to back it. We are not prepared to back it if we are not prepared to give reasonable child benefit. If we look at where we stand on child benefit internationally, the amount of support we give to children in our society is appalling. We are at the bottom of the European league table. How can we allow ourselves to continue with this deception that we are a family oriented country when we are not prepared to provide support for families? That is the thinking behind this amendment.</P>
      <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's opposition to the amendment. I understand from where he is coming and, from the narrowly focused view he presents, it stands up. However, if we look at the broader concept, it does not accept the point about the need to support families and the extent of child poverty and the lack of support, in comparative terms, which we provide for children. On that basis, the Minister's defence is very flimsy and does not stand up and I must press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the Fine Gael amendment. I have borne in mind the Minister's comments. It is difficult if one gives an allowance or benefit to young children, in particular, to reduce it at a particular time even though they are still young. That is something all sides of the House will have to tease out in the years ahead. I was very interested in the Combat Poverty proposals to which the Minister referred and I welcome the opportunity to study them in detail. They address the type of issue the Labour Party has raised in amendment No. 13 on the introduction of a child benefit support or a parental payment which would be a significant support to the family.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made an important point in that we still significantly lag behind other countries. If we take the net benefit for the first two children, we are basically talking about £10 per week. I am not too sure of the changes which took place yesterday in the budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, but when we compared the figures last year, the UK provided £15 sterling for the first and second child. The supports we provide are significantly below those in other countries. The Minister faces a huge task in this regard and it is one which, with the help of colleagues in the Combat Poverty Agency and other groups, we should try to fundamentally address in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a plea for children in the 25 most deprived areas, both rural and urban. In the next year or so, the Minister should look at ways to provide extra supports for child care. In my constituency in a parish with 45% unemployment, a child care programme is starting. We need fundamental support in such areas and the amount of money which the Minister and the Minister for <Col N="828" /> Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have allocated is minimal compared to what we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. This year £46 million is being dedicated to the supply of child care of which my Department is getting £5 million. We will be hard pushed to spend that money and to find organisations through the community development projects&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt there will be one or two which might benefit if they apply. I assure the Deputy that is the case in terms of spending the £46 million. That figure will be paid out over the programme of the national development plan in which £250 million has been committed to the supply of child care. Over that period, there will be a substantial increase in the supply, particularly in the areas of disadvantage to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy O'Keeffe's criticism of my commitment and that of this Government to child benefit and the payment of it to families. Only three years ago in 1997, the Deputy's party was part of a Government which gave £1 to the first two children and £5 for each subsequent child. That was the easy option &ndash; £1. It could have given £2 and £4 but it gave £1 and £5. The Deputy should not criticise me. Three years later, we gave £8 and £10, the highest increase in child benefit in the history of the State &ndash; £106 million. It is a 25% increase on last year's budget so the Deputy should not criticise me.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed and has agreed with the social partners to increase and move towards the sum of £100 for child benefit per month for the third and subsequent child. This has been agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. At the end of my tenure as Minister, we will be well on the way to achieving that figure. I would say to any independent commentator that my tenure and that of this Government will see the most substantial rise in child related benefits in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is going down the route he went down on Committee Stage of talking about the figures by which he increased child benefit. When the figures for child benefit are taken as percentages, the percentage increase in the three budgets from 1994-97 introduced by the Government the Minister criticised so much was 50% compared with the 42% increase over the period of the three Social Welfare Bills he introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can use figures to suit himself. Percentage increases are based on the base rate figure and the amount of the increase. The Minister voted against the high increases proposed in one of the previous Government's Social Welfare Bills. He is working from a higher base and, therefore, the figures are higher. That is what percentages are about. As my colleague pointed out, the economic situation is much better on this occasion. The opportunity to do something worthwhile by introducing substantial increases in child benefit has been lost.</P>
      <P>Why should a higher rate of benefit apply in respect of the third and subsequent children? Most couples nowadays do not have large families. Why should the first and second child be discriminated against in terms of child benefit? There is no reason the rate of child benefit for the first and second child should not be the same as the rate for the third and fourth child. The Minister and his predecessors have discriminated against the first and second child. All children should be treated equally.</P>
      <P>Three different rates of child dependant allowance apply. A child dependant allowance of £13.20 a week is payable in respect of the child of an unemployed person, £15 a week is payable in respect of the child of persons in receipt of lone parent allowance and £17 a week is payable in respect of the child of a person in receipt of an invalidity pension. We talk about equal rights and opportunities and equality legislation, yet child dependant allowance is paid at different rates in respect of children in the same economic circumstances. That does not make sense. That same argument applies to child benefit for the third and subsequent children, yet the Minister is adamant he is doing a tremendous job.</P>
      <P>Matters are progressing and we are moving in the right direction, but not enough of the surplus money in the Exchequer is filtering down to the less well off. That will be demonstrated clearly in April. A number of people in the lower income category have contacted me recently about their tax free allowances. The tax free allowance certificates they received this year are identical to those they received last year. When they receive their wage packets in April, they will not benefit from the bonanza that was supposed to accrue from tax allowances. This Bill presents the Minister with an ideal opportunity to make further increases in child benefit. As he said, it is a good way to ensure the money is spent on children. It is usually the female spouse who receives child benefit and statistics show that money is spent on the children. I ask the Minister to consider what more can be done to make improvements in this area. I ask him to reconsider the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe and me and the one tabled by Deputy Broughan, as there is merit in them. The Minister might not be able to accept them this year, but I am sure we would be satisfied if he gave a commitment to move towards those figures in next year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled in response to the continuous urgings of a number of groups who consider that the parents of twins should be treated in the same way as the parents of three or more children. Like other Deputies, I am sure the Minister has met constituents who believe that having two babies in a house is similar to having three or more. One agency has been in constant contact with the Minister and it asked him to reconsider this proposal. Perhaps he might introduce a measure in this regard in next year's budget. As he stated on Committee Stage, before the 1997 general election he gave a commitment in respect of child benefit to multiple birth parents, which to a large extent we support, but he might address the gap in this area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan said we made considerable progress on a commitment we gave prior to the last general election, we delivered on that commitment in our first budget. We gave a commitment to provide a 50% increase in child benefit for twins and we did that in the first Social Welfare Bill I introduced. I got a letter from one of the leaders of the campaign on 21 October 1997 calling on me, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to honour a firm commitment given by the Minister, Deputy <Col N="831" /> Woods, when he was Opposition spokesperson on this area, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in June that year to give a 50% increase in the monthly payments to parents of twins in receipt of child benefit on budget day, 3 December 1997. We did that. We fulfilled that commitment given prior to the last general election. At that time, I made compensatory changes for multiple birth parents. We also made other commitments as a political party and as a Government that have yet to be fulfilled. Although we are very near it, we have yet to fulfil our commitment to reach £100 for old age pensioners by 2002. In effect we will do that next year. We are also committed to bringing non-contributory pensioners to £100 by 2002, something we did not promise two and a half years ago. Those commitments will cost money. We made commitments in relation to child benefit and other issues in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Those commitments, in conjunction with others, are primary.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy will be on my agenda as long as I am Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and if money is available in the next or in the following budget I might be able to bring it to 100%; it cost about £5.5 million in benefits for 12,500 twin births. We will do our best. However, at this time, I have fulfilled the commitments made prior to the election in this area. There are other commitments to be delivered on and we will try to address those before we come back to this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;7. &ndash; The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil <Col N="832" /> Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension of family income supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The real issue here is why the Government continues to persist in discriminating against the self-employed. Family income supplement is available to those in salaried employment, but the Government consistently refuses to accept the principle of extending it to the self-employed, and has given no reason other than cost. If there is a system in place which benefits some of our people and this benefit is denied to others, those others are effectively penalised to the extent of the amount being saved by not extending the scheme to them.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the question of cost is a legitimate factor here. We are talking about £47 million if farmers are excluded, but I see no reason for excluding farmers. There are small farmers who need to be helped as well. We are talking about a figure of about £80 million if farmers are included.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I am talking about all the self-employed. Looking at the self-employed generally, at what I might loosely call the merchant class, some of them are very well off and more power to them. They will not be looking for this assistance. There are also those running very small businesses and trying to raise a family on the income from those businesses. Why should we discriminate against them? They are, in many ways, the backbone of the country and yet there is continuing discrimination in not allowing them access to the family income supplement, even if they have very large families. Why? Is this another anti-family measure? </P>
    <P>The same principle applies to farmers. When I raised this issue with the Minister previously, he had a separate category of costs if farmers were included rather than excluded. Why does the Minister discriminate against farmers? There are small farmers with large families who are very poorly off. If that is their situation, why should they not get the same assistance that is available to everybody else? Why should they not have access to the family income supplement?</P>

      <P>I hate to have to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but there are over 1,000 farm families from the poorer section of the farming community who have cause to rue the introduction of the farm assist scheme because their benefit has been cut off or cut down. That is what the Minister has done for some of the poorest agricultural families in the country. The fact that the IFA backs something does not automatically mean it has my support. I totally rejected the farm assist approach. There are already indications, in the Minister's modifications to it in this year's Bill, that he accepts my criticism. He is already trying to improve the system because he knows it has caused hardship.</P>
      <P>Let me return to the family income supplement. Is there any coherent explanation why those who are in a small way of business, whether farming, shopkeeping, plumbing or anything else, and trying to rear a family should be discriminated against because they are on a self-employed rather than a salaried basis? The Minister has never confronted that issue. That is why I have pressed very strongly, since I took over this portfolio a year or two ago, for the inclusion of such people under the provisions of the family income supplement. There is no defence in logic, in theory, in practice, for the Government continuing to discriminate against the self-employed. The Minister should put his hands in the air and admit that he has made a mistake and that it is time to look at it again and ensure that the small people who are in business, in shops, in the service industry, on farms and so on are given the same benefits from the family income supplement as those in salaried employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>At the heart of this amendment is that two families with similar commitments are treated differently under this scheme. One family is headed by a worker working for, say, the local authority, and his net income is £10,000 per annum. The other is headed by someone who is self-employed, running a small post office, a shop or a farm, and his net income is £10,000. They each have a wife and three dependent children. To help to maintain the PAYE worker and his family, the State gives them about £60 a week for which they qualify under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tremendous scheme is worthwhile and they deserve to qualify under it. However, the neighbouring family who have the same income, commitments and responsibilities will not qualify. There is no justification for this, but I suspect the Minister, at the prompting of his Department or from his experience, is suspicious of the self-employed. This became evident on Committee Stage when he said the self-employed are self-<Col N="834" /> assessed for tax purposes. He let the cat out of the bag in that comment, because what he is really saying is that anybody who is self-assessed for tax purposes is under suspicion. He does not trust them and he does not think they are playing the game fairly or laying their cards on the table. The Minister is casting a slur on the many people who are self-employed, their accountants and those who make their returns for them.</P>

      <P>Having been somebody who assessed his income, is he suggesting that he knows the loopholes and possible ways out? I doubt that is the case. He could not have taken on his portfolio with that type of suspicion hanging over his head. I assume, therefore, that he will want to withdraw the slur he cast on the self-employed on Committee Stage and he will have an opportunity to do so shortly.</P>
      <P>The self-employed submit their figures, which must be sanctioned, to the Revenue, but the Minister is saying the Department still will not accept them. Two limbs of Government are involved, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance is happy that people are submitting proper accounts and it agrees that their income is a certain amount for the year. However, when those figures are sent to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, it will not accept them because it thinks the people concerned are on the fiddle. It thinks they are not being up front and it will not give them anything. It is outrageous that one arm of Government is treating the other so suspiciously and this must be corrected.</P>
      <P>The experience of our near neighbour is often quoted in relation to how various things should be done and how the system should work. However, in Britain and Northern Ireland, the equivalent of family income supplement is payable to the self-employed if they come within the income limits. If such a system operates satisfactorily there, why can it not be done here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acting Chairman, Deputy Coughlan, will recall the discussions at the former Committee on the Family some time ago in relation to family income supplement. A strong case was made by the Acting Chairman's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, that there was no reason the self-employed should be excluded from family income supplement. One of the recommendations of that all-party committee was that the family income supplement should be extended to the self-employed. The Acting Chair<Col N="835" /> man will recall that she was a member of that committee and that she supported that move.</P>

      <P>We were in Government. It was towards the end of our time in office and it was not implemented. However, that Government was wrong not to implement it because there is an unanswerable case. When a division is called on this amendment shortly, I hope the Acting Chairman will remember the stance she took at that time. I hope she will not sweep it under the carpet and change her mind. I also hope the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will not forget how vociferously she made the case on that occasion and that she will support the Opposition. This would show that she has not thrown out everything she said in the past and that she is prepared to stand up and be counted.</P>
      <P>The Minister must consider this matter carefully. I am disappointed that in the programme for Government, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the farming organisations in particular did not take a stand on this matter. The Minister mentioned that Mr. Parlon of the IFA had welcomed the farm assist scheme. He welcomed it at the time and I compliment the Minister and his officials on the greatest con job of all time. People talk about buying or selling a dummy, but somebody bought a pig in a bag on that occasion. A man announced on the six o'clock news that he had secured a tremendous deal for farmers, but many of them are giving out about it at AGMs which are being held at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief concern of amendment No. 15 relates to people who were unemployed, participated in the back to work scheme and have established businesses. The business may be struggling but is surviving its difficult early years. Such businesses can reach a critical phase after the fourth year in the partnership areas when the supports are removed. I have encountered such examples during my work in the network of enterprise supports for start up and small businesses on the north side of Dublin. This phase can be critical for some businesses and I have received many representations from people involved in new businesses that the family income supplement might be one way of supplementing their income.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it takes an heroic effort to go from being unemployed to running a small business. It has become easier in recent years but up to three or four years ago, it was a colossal achievement. The supports available through the back to work scheme and the social welfare system are valuable, but one reaches a stage where there is no support. Family income supplement could be a means of giving extra help to the people concerned. This was one of key demands of people who left the unemployment register and went into employment which was noted in a study carried out by the Labour Party on the back to work scheme a couple of years ago. These people had survived but they still needed some help after three or four years. I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that he could not accede to my amendment because he would have to address the broader issue referred to by my Fine Gael colleagues. Obviously, there are considerable advantages for those on self-assessment<i> vis-à-vis</i> those in the PAYE sector. We can clearly ascertain what moneys were received and paid by those in the PAYE sector in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, but serious allegations have been made against a particular segment of the self-employed sector to the effect that considerable funds were not put at the country's disposal, possibly by illegal means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the recent launch of former Minister and European Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry's book which was co-authored by Mr. Padraic White, former head of the IDA, on the development of the Celtic tiger. The book is a very interesting read. I always felt that the questions posed by Mr. MacSharry when he was a Minister in the mid to late 1980s were the wrong questions to which the wrong answers were arrived at. The people I represent, particularly the unemployed and those in the PAYE sector, experienced a great deal of needless suffering at that time. We had sufficient funds in this country in the 1970s and 1980s to establish the necessary State <Col N="837" /> schemes and social welfare system. We all know there was money in the country. We underwent a phoney fiscal crisis and retrenchment but the suffering of the people represented by the Labour Party and others was very real. They carried the can for those who failed to make their contribution to the kitty. That is unforgivable. That is the background against which we should measure the proposals in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I understand the comments made by Deputies O'Keeffe and McGrath to the effect that low paid private sector employees deserve additional assistance and that families could be treated very unfairly. The Minister stated on Committee Stage that the application of the tax credit system to everyone, whether self-employed or in the PAYE net, might provide a way forward. That would probably be a fair and transparent way of ensuring that those who deserve additional assistance would receive it through the taxation system. I urge the Minister to consider my amendment favourably in regard to providing some additional assistance to those who come off the live register, establish a business and struggle to make it work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of self-employed people work 40 hour weekends rather than 40 hour weeks and receive little, if any, support. I support Deputy McGrath's point in regard to the inequity which exists between self-employed people and PAYE earners. Although some small businesses may employ one or two members of staff, some of them make no net profit whatsoever once they have paid wages and running costs. If people have audited accounts which show that they are entitled to income support, that support should be provided, as happens in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Many self-employed people are quite poor and they should be assessed and supported when their need is established. Some people are self-employed by virtue of their backgrounds and they should be encouraged where they wish to remain self-employed. Huge supports are available to assist people starting up their own businesses but those supports are withdrawn after two years in some cases and people can get into difficulties. Income-based assessments should be carried out to determine people's eligibility to supports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have done a fantastic job in selling a pup to farmers, one which has produced absolutely nothing. The IFA and the other representative organisations seem to have fallen for the farm assist scheme, although the reasons for that are not yet clear. The scheme has been in operation for almost 12 months now but it has not produced one brass penny. It has not cost the Government anything worth talking about to change to the farm assist scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slur cast on the self-employed by the Minister is extremely serious. He basically said that the accounts provided by people in self-assess<Col N="838" /> ment situations cannot be taken seriously. Deputy Broughan referred to former Commissioner and Minister, Mr. Ray MacSharry. Now that he has taken to writing books, I hope he will write one about the rise and fall of deer farming, outlining his ideas on how the serious situation in which many deer farmers find themselves could be rectified. Some of these farmers would not be seeking assistance at all were it not for the manner in which they were let down by former Minister, Mr. MacSharry, and others, namely, former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, and the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, who was very committed to and supportive of the Galtee Deer enterprise.</P>
    <P>This morning I was contacted by a person who experienced difficulties obtaining the farm assist payment and he asked me whether farmers would receive a better deal from the Taxing Master than the social welfare officers. This is a very serious matter. When small farmers produce detailed accounts containing receipts and so on, only to eventually gain £30 in a quasi-appeal, they can feel very upset that the accounts for which they paid are neither accepted nor deemed acceptable by social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>There is no way around this problem but for the Minister to accept that if self-employed people, whether corner-shopkeepers or small builders, who may be advancing in years and may be unable to keep pace with a changing industry but who are entitled to live out their remaining years with a reasonable level of dignity, produce accounts and documentation, they should be entitled, like their colleagues across the Border, to have those accounts accepted for the determination of their eligibility to family income supplement in the same way as a PAYE earner.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the Minister to defend his position, as others have done &ndash; I ask him to remedy the problem by realising that the Minister, the IFA and everyone involved have made a major blunder. The self-employed deserve the same rights as everyone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Secretary General of my Department to have a comprehensive response to the committee's report prepared by the end of June. I look forward to receiving that response, putting it into the public domain and coming forward with an implementation plan.</P>
      <P>The committee pulled no punches in its analysis and conclusions and it is up to management now to respond in a constructive and positive fashion. If the committee has got it wrong in some respects, I have asked management to spell this out so the debate can move forward.</P>
      <P>The committee, Ministers and the Department share one common objective &ndash; to serve the customer, in this case the fishing industry, better. I wish to put on record the commitment and dedication of the staff of our sea fisheries divisions who work long and hard on behalf of the sector and far beyond the call of duty. In this context, the level of service to the sector in some respects has improved substantially in recent years. When the committee first met the Department in 1998 there was a major backlog in dealing with licence applications. This backlog was eliminated in 1999 and applications are now being dealt with within three weeks. However, more needs to be, and will be, done.</P>
      <P>The committee highlighted what it termed a poor relationship between the Department and the sector. This, in my view, would be better described as a communications deficit with local groups and the individual fisherman. The committee has acknowledged that, with existing resources and staff levels, filling this deficit poses major challenges for the Department. These challenges must be faced.</P>
      <P> It also poses major challenges for the national fishing industry organisations. There is a close working relationship at national level between the Department and the fishing industry and the industry is given every opportunity to input into policy making and EU and international negotiations. However, the Department cannot be expected to compensate for fragmentation in the structure of industry representation at national level or weaknesses in the communications process within the industry itself. I have asked management to consider this aspect in its response to the committee's report.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Strategic Management Initiative committee on this report. The findings do not surprise me. Indeed, I raised this with the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and pointed out the lack of response from officials when I wrote to them on various matters. I asked him to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a shocking indictment of the service that it is widely accepted that if one leaves a message with the Department it is virtually guaranteed that nobody will ring back? Is there not something wrong with the number of forms, approximately 930, used by the Department? <Col N="840" /> Many of the forms are outdated and incomprehensible. I am also concerned that the fleet and fishermen suffered as a result of being penalised on foot of regulations about which they had not been made aware. If staffing resources are an issue, it is incumbent on the Department to be more professional and customer friendly by providing the staff.</P>
    <P>One observation in the report was that the Department was too centralised in Dublin. Will the Minister of State comment on that aspect of the report in the context of decentralisation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee recommends relocation nearer to the Department's client base. However, the client base in the sea fisheries sector is dispersed around the coast. The Deputy will be aware that there are 30 organisations representing diverse sectoral and regional interests. I will not list them here but that makes the situation a little more difficult.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is recommended and it will be considered. All aspects of the report will be considered to ensure the Department can provide a better service to an industry with tremendous potential. Nobody is so good that they cannot be better. We have already asked that the Department reach a point where callers will be more inclined to remark on how good it was to talk to our officials. That is preferable to the disappointing attitude that is generally held with regard to civil servants. All of us have a role to play in this regard. Customer friendly relationships will be built up within the Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the number of forms in the Department. They are being examined at present and if they are outdated they should be removed. The problem of telephone calls not receiving a response deserves attention. Management in the Department has been asked to look at all aspects of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to a question raised in the House on 10 February, the present licensing terms and financial and taxation provisions were introduced in 1992 and have been supported by every Government since then. I believe that without these terms there would be little or no exploration off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>I am aware there is a body of opinion which believes that our licensing terms are too generous and that there are vast quantities of oil and gas in our offshore about to be exploited by foreign exploration companies with few benefits accruing to Ireland. The reality is that companies are not queueing up at present seeking exploration licences in our offshore. Since 1992 a total of 36 exploration licences have been granted, of which 26 were frontier licences. Fourteen of those licences have been relinquished, including seven of the frontier licences.</P>
      <P>It is a stark fact that the prospectivity of our offshore area has been demonstrated, over the period 1971 to date, to be consistently low. It is almost 30 years since Ireland's last commercial find. Although 133 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore since 1971 to date &ndash; all undertaken and financed by the exploration companies &ndash; there has been limited success with only the Kinsale/Ballycotton and the Helvick fields being declared commercial. This level of success in making commercial finds does not compare with the UK or the North Sea. In addition, our waters are deep and operating conditions are among the most difficult in Europe.</P>
      <P>Given these facts, the 1992 terms were designed to maintain the competitiveness of the Irish offshore in comparison to other exploration areas. Without exploration there can be no prospect of production, which carries with it the best prospects of benefit to the Irish economy. I will review the 1992 terms when and if I consider it necessary, having regard to the overall need not to jeopardise the interest or involvement of oil companies in our offshore areas. I have asked my Department to provide me with a preliminary assessment of developments since 1992, including any change in prospectivity, which might warrant a review. In the light of this assessment, which I expect by mid-year, I will make a decision on whether a formal review would be in the best interests of all stakeholders.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Corrib gas discovery, it is too early to speculate as to the potential benefits. The gas field has not yet been declared commercial; further appraisal drilling will be undertaken this year and the licensees hope to be in a position to decide on commerciality in December this year.</P>

Many proposals and recommendations have been made to us from the west coast. While we must take our membership of the EU into account, we will be encouraging all companies to participate. We are holding a seminar in the not too distant future to provide for all companies who believe they could have an input to talk to us and to work together towards the provision of supply services which are currently being provided from abroad.</P>

      <P>The French Tuna Fishermen Organisation registered an application with the European Court of Justice in August 1998 seeking annulment of Council Regulation 1239/98 which bans drift netting for tuna from 1 January 2002. An oral hearing on the question of the admissibility of this action was heard by the court on 23 November 1999. The Irish authorities and <Col N="843" /> the Irish Tuna Association, as well as the French authorities, made a case and oral submissions to the court in support of the admissibility of the case. The Council of the European Union, supported by Spain and the Commission, sought that the action might be declared inadmissible.</P>
      <P>The court delivered its judgment on the question of admissibility on 22 February. It held the action to be inadmissible and in consequence the case will not now proceed to a full hearing. The Deputy will be aware that Ireland submitted a comprehensive formal intervention to the court on the merits of the case with the full support of the Irish tuna fishing industry. The advice available to me is that in light of the judgment there is no further legal mechanism available to the State or the industry under which to challenge the ban.</P>

Will the Minister of State assure the House that if a quota is introduced he will ensure that a realistic quota is allocated to Irish fishermen, especially those in the south-west who are engaged in this fishery? Will he confirm if compensation will be provided to the tuna fishermen who have been involved in this type of fishery as a result of the changed decision on fishing for tuna?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council agreed as part of the package to postpone the introduction of the ban and on a provision that the number of authorised drift net participants from 1998 onward would not exceed 60% of those with a track record in the fishery in the period 1995-7. On this basis we were in a position to issue 18 licences to individuals with a previous track record for drift tuna fishing in 1998 and 1999. In addition, fishing trials were undertaken by BIM in 1998 and 1999 with the support of EU aid using alternative fishing techniques, such as trawling and pelagic gear. On the results to date, a level of participation by Irish fishermen in the albacore tuna fisheries will be maintained when the drift net ban comes into force in two years' time. The question of compen<Col N="844" /> sation for fishermen who did not receive a drift net authorisation in 1998 or 1999 does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it should arise? Drift netting was found to be defective and the new type of netting system employed means that fishermen will lose out. What preparations will we have taken to ensure that if albacore tuna becomes a quoted species, the average catch over the years will be taken into consideration and that Ireland will get a realistic quota? Will the Minister of State give such an assurance in the context of what happened in the past? For example, with regard to horse mackerel we were seriously deficient in the quota we secured, even based on the average catches over the years. Will he assure the House that we will be to the forefront in securing a realistic quota based on average catches?</P>

Nevertheless, he gave a clear indication at the time that we have a great conviction about our rights in this instance. We are also conscious of the fact that there is a need for conservation.</P>
      <P>BIM carried out trials in 1998 and 1999 to evaluate alternative legal methods for fishing albacore tuna. Five pairs of pelagic vessels and three trawling vessels took part in the 1998 trials, while eight pairs of pelagic vessels &ndash; five vessels using the trawling technique and one surface long lining vessel &ndash; took part in the 1999 trials. The 1998 trials were inconclusive and catches were poor.</P>

      <Quest>if the new forestry grants recently announced by his Department are on par with the proposals submitted by his Department to Brussels in August 1999; and if he has satisfied himself that forestry can compete with other better paying EU schemes for land use.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased afforestation grants of approximately 30% which I announced on 6 March are as proposed to the European Commission last year. The increases in premium payments, averaging approximately 32% although not matching, compare very favourably with the proposals submitted. I am satisfied the new rates represent a significant advance for forestry and <Col N="845" /> will help forestry to compete on an equal footing with other land use schemes.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other related issues which will improve the competitive position of forestry. These include the definition of farmers, which is being addressed in the context of the rural development plan.</P>
      <P>My officials are in discussions with their colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to examine ways of complementing forestry and REPS. I am now taking up the case of farmers who had planted in earlier years and will be pursuing adequate premium increases for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still convinced that forestry cannot compete with other EU schemes for land use. The Minister of State sought a grant payment level of £335 per hectare and settled for £308, which is 12% short of what he proposed to Brussels. Why did he not stick it out for his original proposal of £335 per hectare? Have the increased grants the Minister of State announced been approved by Brussels and has he received that approval in writing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and I know the Deputy will be pleased to hear that. Regarding the figure of £335 we sought, I recall we were told earlier that £245 was the maximum we would receive. After Christmas, I was asked to accept a figure of £280, but I stuck it out for as long as I could and there were many calls from the Deputy and others in the industry who sought a decision. However, I hung on and obtained a figure of £308 after being advised to take the figure of £280. We obtained a very good deal.</P>
      <P>I have advised farmers that whatever deal was done would apply to the current planting season which stretches back to October and November of 1999. Anyone who planted as far back as November 1999 and up to the end of this planting season will benefit from the increases of 33%. If any other industry were to receive that level of increase, I would be interested to hear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister failed to include farmers who planted under the CAP forestry measures since 1992. Will those people now be left out in the wilderness? It is no good for the Minister of State to say he is making representations to Brussels. Why was it not all included in the one package? I doubt he will make any headway in this matter now. These are the people who pioneered forestry in this country and they are now being left out in the cold.</P>

I am determined to acquire <Col N="846" /> additional premia for those who planted in 1992. Interestingly, they signed a contract where they deemed themselves to be satisfied with what was offered then. Those who will now receive the grant level of £308 for land which would be put to another use are similar to those who planted from 1992, so I will seek equity across the board. I cannot guarantee it, but I expect that the Deputy, being the gracious person he is, will congratulate me in two months' time.</P>

      <P>I will bring forward legislation to deal with the issue raised by the Deputy as soon as I can find a reasonable and sustainable basis in international law for such legislation. To prepare this legislation, my Department must rely on the advice of the Attorney General's office and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Intensive legal and technical analyses of the scope for such legislation has been ongoing over the past two years. This has included the commissioning of an independent report from a major authority in this field, in-depth analysis by the Attorney General's office, the preparation of a technical report by my Department working with BIM and the Naval Service, consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and, more recently, the receipt of senior counsel advice and the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are extremely complex and nobody should underestimate the difficulties involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we implement the law of the sea convention we signed four years ago <Col N="847" /> next July? Is the Minister of State aware that Ireland's sovereign rights under international law are ignored? To protect those sovereign rights, Ireland is obliged to take ownership of its sea area, which equates to more than 250,000 square miles of sea. Unless Ireland maintains a presence, other states and their vessels will exercise this sovereign right in sea areas under the control of our State and thereby disenfranchise Ireland in this matter. Why are we afraid to implement the convention? Has the Minister of State received clearance from the Attorney General? Has the Attorney General put it on the back burner? What is wrong? Irish fishermen are the victims of harassment by other European and international trawler owners.</P>

      <P>I am aware that an eminent professor of law in Trinity College has given his opinion that there is nothing to prevent the Government from implementing these conventions. However, the legal advice to the Government comes from the Attorney General and it is his opinion which must guide me when I consider these matters. The Irish instrument of ratification of this convention was lodged with the United Nations on 21 June 1996. Unusually for conventions of this type, we ratified it in advance of all the necessary enabling legislation being put in place. The progress of such legislation was co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, and the current Minister has been in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that all outstanding issues under the convention are dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

As regards the suggestion that we are afraid, nothing could be further from the truth. I am not aware of specific EU legislation in this area. We are free to introduce national measures if we see fit and we intend doing so. However, it is a requirement of EU law that any measures introduced by a member state must be non-discriminatory and applied equally to all EU vessels, including those from Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to a similar question raised in the House on 10 February, the study referred to by the Deputy presents empirical data and costs about the number of exploration and appraisal wells drilled off Ireland since 1971 and points out the employment created onshore arising from this expenditure in the past and the potential for such employment in the future. The study draws straightforward conclusions from these levels of past activity. It also puts forward a programme of action which addresses the issue of opportunities for Irish industry in the domestic and international offshore industry. The report is a constructive contribution to public discussion on this issue.</P>
      <P>Since 10 February I met a delegation from the Irish Offshore Operators Association and had a useful discussion on how Irish industry could increase its share of goods and services supplied to the offshore exploration sector. I highlighted my expectations that Irish companies should be given full and fair opportunities to compete at all stages of exploration and to bid for work. I also expect that every effort will be made to accommodate small suppliers.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my reply in February that I was organising a business awareness seminar for the suppliers of goods and services to the exploration and production sector. A seminar called Contract Awareness for the Offshore Sector will be held in Westport on Friday, 14 April and is being organised by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Offshore Operators Association. We are bringing together all interested parties to ensure our strategies are effective and our bids are competitive in all respects if and when contracts are on offer. I will be able to present for the first time to any exploration concern a full and comprehensive inventory of Irish skills and know-how.</P>

This seminar will highlight the Irish expertise available for any company which intends working off our coast. It would be more beneficial economically for a company working offshore to have an Irish base. The seminar is being held to make companies aware of the activities of others and to ensure everyone has a say. I have no difficulty inviting anyone with an interest in this area or in securing offshore jobs for Irish people to attend the seminar.</P>

        <b>:</b> I listened to what the Minister of State said in reply to priority questions. It is well known in the oil and gas industry that there is fabulous mineral wealth in the Corrib field. However, the Government continues to collude in giving away this wealth to a multinational company at virtually no return to the people. All royalties are free and the taxation regime is laughable. I ask the Minister to seriously review the situation so that the people will benefit from the mineral wealth off our coast in the same way as the Norwegians benefit from their mineral wealth.</P>
      <P>There are no guarantees from Enterprise Oil or anyone else involved that Irish workers will be employed and the Government has not insisted that they should be. It is clear the operation will be run without Irish workers. Does the Minister of State agree that the correct procedure would have been to set up a State owned exploration company under the auspices of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to bring the gas ashore for the benefit of the people rather than for multinational profit? </P>

      <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the establishment of a new National Maritime College with combined seafarer training facilities for both the Naval Service and the Cork Institute of Technology was the key recommendation of the Task Force on Seafarer Training and Employment. The task force stressed that more detailed costings would be necessary before the project could proceed.</P>
      <P>An expert interdepartmental working group was subsequently set up to examine the costings, financing and timing of the new National Maritime College, the establishment of which is a commitment in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed in November 1999. The group recently completed its work and submitted a comprehensive report to me, including an independent consultancy study on the feasibility of establishing the college through public private sector partnership arrangements.

      <P>I was under the impression that the college was to be located in Cork. There was an announcement during a Cork by-election that a maritime training college was to be established in Ringaskiddy, so the people of Cork are prepared for it. However, I was hoping the Minister of State would have more positive news and I am disappointed to hear him use the word &ldquo;feasibility&rdquo;. The college was announced in the Government's action programme so I would have thought that we would be beyond the feasibility study stage. I had hoped that plans would be more definite at this stage and I am concerned that the report may be rejected by Government. Can the Minister of State give an assurance that the Government intends to proceed with the college in Ringaskiddy?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our fisheries protection services at sea and on land work closely to ensure that flagship activities in the Irish zone are rigorously monitored and controlled. The new EU fisheries control regulation which came into force last year provides for a much tighter control regime generally, including the monitoring of flagships. Vessels intending to land into ports other than those of their flag state must give at least four hours advance notice. They must also specify the port of landing and time of arrival.</P>
      <P>The advance notice requirements facilitate a very targeted scrutiny of flagship landings by the Department's sea fisheries officers. The new regulations also provide a framework for closer co-operation and information exchange between member states. Long-standing co-operation and information exchange with UK authorities has paid dividends in terms of enhanced control of flagship activities. Arrangements are also in place to improve on-going liaison with Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is meeting Commissioner Fischler next week to outline his policy priorities in sea fisheries. These include improved technical conservation measures to protect vulnerable fish stocks and the urgent need for member states to ensure compliance with the rules by all EU fishing fleets, irrespective of where they are flagged.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that flags of convenience are extensively used to avoid proper health and safety regulations on ships? Does he also agree that they are used to employ non trade union labour and to avoid national and international statutory regulations? Will the new four hour notification arrangement allow sufficient time for health and safety officers to inspect facilities and health and safety precautions on ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to disagree with the Deputy and I welcome his comments, and those of other Deputies, on this issue. I live among the fishing community and I am well aware of the difficulties. Approximately 150 flagships operate in western waters. Most of these ships are UK registered, 12 are on the Irish register, and an increasing number are registered in France and Germany, most of which are Spanish-owned.</P>
      <P>There is close liaison and exchange of information with UK authorities on fisheries control, including flagships, which covers the issue of health and safety raised by the Deputy. This exchange has contributed considerably to a tightening up of the regime, but we are not fully there yet.</P>

Is the Government serious in its intent to ban flagships? The Minister of State must know, having seen the British experience, that this is a non-starter. Will he admit this is an unrealistic proposal?</P>

      <P>There is aspiration and there is realism, and I accept what the Deputy says. It is not easy to eliminate flagships. We want to eliminate the illegal activities of flagships through effective controls. EU treaty provisions on the right of establishment and freedom of movement may make a total ban unrealistic. There are ongoing efforts to ensure closer economic links with the countries of registry. It is a complex debate. While this is aspirational, it is very much on the agenda and it is our intention to raise the issue with Commissioner Fischler.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always striving to improve the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts to ensure it continues to meet both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is already close co-operation between EU member states on marine search and rescue operations, a co-ordinated EU coastguard service financed by the EU would have obvious merits from this country's perspective. There are, however, no firm proposals at present at Euro<Col N="854" /> pean level to develop policies in that direction. Moreover, there are no funds available from the EU to support marine search and rescue services and this subject is not on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Major strides have been made in recent years to bring the quality of resources, readiness, training and management up to a level in Ireland that is second to none in Europe at present. The Irish Coastguard, a division of my Department, has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport. These helicopters are available on a 24 hours a day, 365 days a year basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. The Coastguard has 65 full-time staff and more than 600 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination-communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</P>
    <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coastguard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner and Waterford, the RNLI, which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast, and seven Community Inshore Rescue Service boats based in strategic locations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda Síochána and its divers, the British coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency. In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs, assist in searches and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved. Stockpiles of anti-pollution equipment are retained for use in the event of an oil pollution incident.</P>
    <P>We are constantly assessing the case, based on risk assessment by location, for improving resources. We are also undertaking a major programme of re-equipment and refurbishment of facilities available to Coastguard volunteers and I can assure the House that I am responding positively in all cases where it is made clear to us that the provision of new facilities and the re-equipment and upgrading of existing facilities will add to our capacity to save lives at sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that EU finance is needed to fund an operation of this magnitude? Has this question been raised at intergovernmental level during discussions on the subject in view of the fact that Ireland is the only island country in the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the issue is not on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. All search and rescue services should be co-ordinated on an EU basis. The system which operates between Britain and this country works well. We have been assisted by the RAF <Col N="855" /> on many occasions and it has been very generous to us. It will arrive within minutes at the drop of a hat. We should have more contact with the French coastguard and I will try to ensure this happens.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will join me in thanking all of those on our coast, the RNLI, the Coastguard, the Garda Síochána, Civil Defence and all the volunteers who help whenever there are difficulties. We are very fortunate to have such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the British services for their regular assistance. Does the Minister agree that much of the search and rescue equipment is antiquated? How long will it take to bring up the service to internationally acceptable standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Elements of the equipment are outdated. Some of the buildings used by the Coastguard are clearly below standard. In the past six years, however, a professional ethos has been brought into the search and rescue services, even through the provision of uniforms for the volunteers. When an unfortunate incident occurs these people are noticeable and they adopt a leadership role. They perform their task well.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the Government to ensure that search and rescue equipment is provided for each and every station around the coast as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main recommendations of the report, as I stated in the House on 10 February 2000, are that the arrangements which have been put in place in recent years as regards the ongoing marine radioactivity monitoring programme carried out by the RPII, and the ongoing research into radiological impacts by the RPII and the university sector, should continue; that caution should be exercised in carrying out any works that may disturb the seabed in any area where radioactive waste has been dumped and a careful assessment of any potential risks made; that the Government should continue its leading role at international level in the protection of the marine environment and that it should strenuously oppose any attempt to renew the practice of dumping radioactive material. As I advised the House on that occasion, I support these recommendations and am committed to continuing the role which the Government has undertaken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department has written again to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries <Col N="856" /> and Food in London reflecting the concerns expressed in the House on 10 February and requesting that there should be no disturbance of the seabed in the areas of concern to us. I understand there are no plans afoot which would involve such disturbance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the consistent lies we have been told by representatives of Sellafield and by some members of the British Government, obviously acting on Sellafield's advice and the fact the task force report indicated there was no cause for concern. In view of the recent information that people in Sellafield falsified records and activities, does the Minister of State agree that we would have to be sceptical about any information from that source and that it might be necessary to re-examine that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could have any doubt about what Deputy Bell said. People along the east coast, throughout Ireland and around the globe are concerned that documents should be falsified in an area which has been so controversial and which has met with opposition from this side of the Irish sea on so many occasions. That falsification was discovered will be beneficial, but it does not help our case and would not encourage us to believe any report from Sellafield or BNFL. It has an enormous amount of damage limitation work to do but that is not sufficient. I accept what Deputy Bell said, that any reports from Sellafield, to which we have given any credence, should be looked at again in light of the information made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State has accepted my point of view as did his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fahey, in reply to a previous question. The Deputy, like me, is from the east coast. What steps does the Government intend to take to allay people's fear, particularly people living along the east coast who bring their children and families to the sea, and to assure them there is no danger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I, Deputy Bell, or any Member of this House would want to engage in scaremongering, but people along the east coast have a genuine reason for fear. As I indicated, there is a job of work to be done to alleviate the fear which exists because there is nothing to fear but fear itself. There may be people who cannot sleep at night because of their concern about what Sellafield is doing to the Irish Sea and how it is affecting people along the east coast. If there is a number of deaths of a particular nature in an area, people are inclined to think it is related to Sellafield. All these issues have to be investigated. A public relations exercise is not what is needed but an exercise in realism and in telling the truth. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has taken a serious view and has been in touch with colleagues in Britain to <Col N="857" /> impress upon them the need to do something urgently.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to a policy of balanced regional development with the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas being a key priority, I have decided that with the exception of a small Dublin office, the bulk of the Marine Institute comprising 60 staff will be relocated to Galway, which is purely coincidental. As well as contributing towards the Government's policy on decentralisation, this will facilitate the construction of the new national facility at Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a number of areas of my Department have already been decentralised and there is a total of 155 staff currently based outside Dublin. The accounts branch with 13 staff members is located in Castlebar, County Mayo, and the Forest Service with a staff of 45 was decentralised to the sunny south east, Wexford, in 1998. In addition, my Department provides local services at a variety of locations, for example, the fishery harbours of Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rosaveal and Killybegs and the Irish Coast Guard has rescue subcentres at Valentia Island, County Kerry and Malin Head, County Donegal.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the review is to recommend an integrated strategic framework for the cost efficient development of harbour infrastructure and facilities at Rossaveel. Tenders have been sought for receipt by end March with a view to awarding a contract as soon as possible thereafter. The review will take particular account of the economic and socio-economic role of the fishing sector in the Rossaveel area as well as Rossaveel's role as a port servicing <Col N="859" /> the Aran Islands. Potential developments in the offshore oil and gas sector and other potential commercial usage of the harbour will also be examined.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the assurance of the Minister of State, but I am disappointed tender documents have been sought for only a review of the harbour's facilities rather than for its use in terms of real work. If review tender documents are to be submitted by March and the review is to be completed by June, does the Minister of State think the refurbishment of Rossaveel Harbour will be ready to cash in on the Corrib gas field discovery, given that his replies to earlier questions indicated that most of the proposed servicing of that gas and oil field will be from Ayr in Scotland? We would like facilities to be available on the west coast, particularly in Rossaveel, to facilitate the servicing of the Corrib gas field discovery.</P>

It has four metres of water at low tide with one deep water berth of just six metres. The harbour is well sheltered and Cashla Bay has excellent swing room for the larger fishing vessels to manoeuvre. It seems an ideal location to develop. I can assure the Deputy, and I am not making a political point, that the Minister, Deputy Fahey, has put in train all he can to make sure that any advantage that can be gained from the Corrib field discovery development will be put in place in that part of the country.</P>

The worst scenario would be to provide a service from an area that cannot cater for what is required.

      <P>The strategic plan for the development of forestry, published in 1996, indicated that Coillte Teoranta would be maintained in public ownership in the medium term but that the full commercial development of the company would provide Government with a wide range of ownership options in the future.</P>
      <P>Last year, AIB Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch International were appointed to carry out a consultancy study to assess the options for the corporate development of Coillte. The study involves considering the role of Coillte in contributing to the Irish forestry sector and the identification and evaluation of appropriate options for the corporate development of Coillte, including strategic alliance and wider share ownership possibilities. The consultants' report is expected very soon and on receipt of it I intend to publish it and invite comments on it from sectoral interests.</P>

      <P>I am confused by some of the reports that have appeared in the national media. One article states that the Government's programme on privatisation is in total disarray as a result of the report. Is there a further report? The report publicised in the national media seems to indicate that the recommendation is against Coillte's privatisation.</P>

      <P>We have examined the draft report, but the final report has not been received and, consequently, I should not comment on it. I read the reports the Deputy mentioned. At this stage no decision has been taken. We will be in a position within a month or so to consider this report and then make a decision as to whether Coillte is ready for privatisation. That will be considered very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the issue. The maintenance of Coillte in public ownership in the medium term was the view expressed three years ago in the strategic plan. Any decisions to be made by Government will take into account <Col N="861" /> the views of the consultants and will be in the best interests of the shareholder and company. I cannot comment on the final report as we have not received it, but we must be careful in making a decision as important and far reaching as the privatisation of Coillte.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to compensate east coast fishermen and their families who have lost their income due to the closure of the Irish Sea cod fishery in the interests of conservation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6113/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, the measures in place to protect the Irish Sea cod stock have been structured to cause the minimum disruption to fishing activity and to retain the maximum range of fishing opportunities possible for east coast vessels. The measures are essential to ensure a viable future for east coast fishermen. They are of short duration and limited impact. In these circumstances the payment of compensation would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under the Irish Sea cod recovery plan, measures have been put in place to protect and rebuild the cod stock in the Irish Sea which is in serious decline. The European Council and Commission agreed in December that a recovery plan had to be put in place this year to save the Irish Sea cod stock. The first phase of the recovery plan, involving a closure of the northern part of the Irish Sea from mid-February to the end of April for the cod fishery was introduced by the Commission following detailed negotiations with member states and their fishing industries.</P>
      <P>As part of the recovery plan the Commission at first proposed a closure of a large area of the western Irish Sea for prawn fishing for the ten week period. The Irish delegation opposed this closure and worked to keep as much as possible of the prawn grounds open in the interests of our fishermen. A small area of prawn grounds overlaps with the biggest concentration of spawning cod in the Irish Sea. The Commission insisted on closing this particular area for the ten week period.</P>
      <P>I accept that some prawn fishermen will have longer steaming times to get to the prawn grounds during this period. However, the bulk of the grounds are still open for prawn fishing. From the end of April all prawn grounds will be fully open for the rest of the year. Fishermen have indicated that the prawn grounds overall are very heavily fished and that prawn catches will in fact probably be better in the areas which are currently closed when the fishery reopens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised on 8 March by my colleagues, Deputies Broughan and Ryan. I understood from the reply at that stage that con<Col N="862" /> sideration was being given to compensating fishermen for loss of income for a lengthy period which had a detrimental effect on fishermen on the east coast. My colleagues were referring particularly to Howth, but it involved other fishermen throughout the east coast area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally responded to Deputy Broughan at an earlier stage. I am not aware of Deputy Ryan's intervention. I indicated clearly that there would not be compensation because, while fishermen have longer steaming times, they are not put out of business. I was surprised to hear of the Green Party making a case for the reopening of this fishery because the fishermen themselves admit that conservation is necessary if their future is to be protected. It is incumbent on me to protect fish stocks so that future generations will have the same opportunities as previous generations. One mistake we made in the past was to allow overfishing. Somebody had to bite the bullet. I am pleased it is being done. It will be beneficial all around.</P>

      <P>As I stated in an earlier reply, the Department is preparing a comprehensive response to the committee's report. We fully acknowledge the need for improved standards of service by the Department to the sea fishing sector and to all our client groups.</P>
      <P>Priority is being given to systematic upgrading of the quality of customer service across the Department and a number of initiatives are already under way which will address, generally and specifically, customer service recommendations contained in the report. The Department's recently appointed customer service manager is overseeing the implementation of these initiatives and will play a key role in monitoring customer service standards across the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no specific customer service area. It will apply right across the Department. Behind the intention to improve customer <Col N="863" /> service is a belief and a philosophy that the customer is always right. That is how it is in the private sector. That is how it should be in the public sector. We have a distance to go. It is as easy to be positive and civil in answering people as it is to be negative. The perception among the public is that the first answer one gets from a Department is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. With training, with concentration of minds, the Irish Civil Service can be the equal of or better than any other. We have to concentrate on that. That does not apply just to my Department. It applies right across the board. The report of the all-party committee has begun a debate that will be beneficial. I welcome it. As I indicated earlier, none of us is so good that we cannot be better. That is the standpoint from which I will start.</P>

With regard to the specific recommendation on training throughout different Departments, training is ongoing in the Civil Service, but it is at clerical officer and staff officer grade. Decisions are made higher up, and unless training percolates through all areas, we will not achieve the type of change that is required. Will the Minister comment?</P>

They will be encouraged to do so. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. As I indicated, it will be much easier for everyone if we have a customer friendly approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department have been in regular contact with the French authorities since January 1999 in connection with the epidemiological report received on two outbreaks of illness allegedly associated with the consumption of mussels exported from Ireland in 1998. I <Col N="864" /> am advised by the Department that in all follow up to date the French authorities have reiterated its position on all aspects of the epidemiological findings and related testing of Irish mussel products following the episodes in question. The advice to me is that at this stage there is no further data which can usefully be provided by the French authorities.</P>
      <P>The key strategic priority is to ensure Irish biotoxin sampling, monitoring and testing systems are to the highest and consistent standard in the interests of the consumer and Irish shellfish producers and exporters.

      <P>I indicated in November that I would travel to France to extricate the information we required. Irrespective of whether that acted as a lever, we got all the information we asked for and it was useful to us. It was sad for the producers. However, lessons were learned by the industry and by ourselves in relation to the monitoring of biotoxins. Our whole system was fragmented and consistency was not what it should be. We have now appointed new people and I hope there will be consistency and a level of staff such as will prevent this happening again.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by environmental groups that the new forestry grants system, agreed with the EU Commission, may promote the planting of conifer trees over broadleaf trees; the steps, if any, he is taking to address these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced significant increases in afforestation grants and premia. The bias in favour of broadleaf trees which existed under the previous system has been maintained <Col N="865" /> under the revised rates. The target for broadleaf trees is also maintained at 20% of overall planting. In addition, I propose to introduce a native woodlands scheme to enhance and increase the size of our semi-native woodlands, which are largely broadleaf woodlands.</P>
      <P>Afforestation, in particular planting of conifers, is probably the only economic activity that will contribute to meeting our commitments under the Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It should be understood that conifers take more carbon from the atmosphere than any other economic activity. Consequently, they will go a long way towards helping us achieve our goals under the Kyoto protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the grants scheme favours conifers rather than broadleaf trees? Is he suggesting that this will continue? Are there any plans to redress the situation? Are there any plans to replace the £220 million worth of saw wood and other wood which is imported each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the strategic plan is to ensure that Ireland will be self-sufficient with regard to timber. At present 9% of the country is under afforestation. If the plan achieves its target, 17% of the country will be under afforestation by 2030. This would give Ireland self-sufficiency with regard to timber.</P>
      <P>Regarding the grants and the bias in favour of conifers or broad leaf trees at present, if one native oak is felled, 50 oaks are planted. Conifers are not the environmental beasts they were portrayed to be. The conifer is an environmentally friendly plant, but there is no bias towards conifers. If farmers are asked to plant, for economic reasons, they choose the timber which will give them the best benefit. That is commerce. However, I stress, because it is not as well known as it should be, that we signed up to the Kyoto agreement which obliges Ireland to reduce its carbon emissions by 2006. It is questionable whether our economic activity will achieve that, but the planting of conifers will achieve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister said the planting of conifers will help to achieve the target. I hope that will be the case. Will the Minister considering asking the Department to give instructions that all planting in national and public parks should involve broad leaf varieties? This would go some way towards increasing the strength of the broad leaf sector. However, for commercial use, the conifer appears to be our only hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable assessment. I do not want to give the impression that I favour conifers over broad leaf trees because both can co-exist happily together. However, as I indicated, I intend to introduce a native woodlands scheme. It is also my intention to introduce an <Col N="866" /> urban forestry programme where woodlands would be planted in or near provincial towns. I assure the Deputy that the native woodlands scheme and the urban forestry programme will involve mainly broad leaf trees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to an identical question on 10 February, a range of issues is involved in this very complex and sensitive matter. On the one hand there is the existence of a binding international commitment on the part of the State, issues to do with safety of marine navigation in our general area and whether we should or could depend in future on GPS, a radio-navigation system operated and maintained by the US. On the other hand there are the understandable concerns of the local communities in the area of the planned site, about the impact on them of the proposed station. I indicated on that occasion that it would take some time to brief myself adequately on the totality of these issues and that I could not give a time frame for when decisions might be made.</P>
      <P>I have now largely completed my review of the issues and I hope shortly to be in a position to put proposals to the Government on a framework within which full consideration of all alternative options and discussions with our international partners may be carried forward in a productive fashion.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to give a time scale This matter has gone on for too long but, on the one hand, we were faced with the issue of the safety of shipping and, on the other, the concerns of local people. We tried to find out if there were alternatives because we must be concerned about the safety of shipping. Irish Lights and all those involved in providing lights around the coast have done a wonderful job and Irish Lights would not want to impose anything which would cause environmental concerns. We are close to completing the review and I hope to be in a position in the next few months to make suggestions to the Government about what should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>That issue is under discussion. We do not want to be surcharged or sued.

We must try to balance the issue of safety at sea with the concerns of local communities. I do not want to give the impression that Loran C has been done away with because discussions and consultations on the matter have not yet been finalised.

      <P>I will meet Commissioner Fischler on 28 March to outline my policy priorities, including the need for improved technical conservation measures.

      <P>The Minister of State indicated that conservation is extremely important and is obviously aware that these technical conservation measures are favoured by fishermen themselves. However, Irish fishermen want the measures to <Col N="868" /> be imposed at EU level. Is he concerned about the practice of gill netting, often in spawning grounds, whereby foreign fishermen shoot out up to 40 miles of gill netting which they leave in place for long periods of time? A Spanish fisherman, who did not wish to be identified, recently indicated that the nets were left in place over the Christmas period and that fishermen returned to find that many of the fish had rotted. This type of netting is raping fish stocks and should be banned at EU level.</P>

      <P>The fishermen's organisations support conservation and the preservation of fish stocks on a long-term basis. When positive proposals are forthcoming from that sector which is affected by any type of conservation proposal, the issue must be considered realistically. The point has been made to me on many occasions that any decision on spawning or breeding grounds must be made at EU level. I respect the Minister of State's intentions in regard to his meeting on 28 March and I hope he will be successful.</P>

      <P>I believe that fishermen themselves should become involved in policing and I will be asking them to do that. Deputies will be aware that getting fishermen to agree to the necessity for conservation represented a major step forward and I commend them on their responsible approach. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the conservation issue can be progressed with the involvement of all European countries. A large number of ships would be required to police our waters and perhaps we should pursue the idea of fishermen taking on a policing role and reaching agreement between themselves. Although we cannot impose that, it may be possible to achieve through a gentlemen's agreement.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension of family income supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of FIS for the self-employed and farmers, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe alleged that the scheme discriminates against self-<Col N="870" /> employed people and asked whether there was any logic to that. The scheme was established in 1984 specifically to provide an incentive to low paid employees with families to take up or return to full-time employment. Deputy O'Keeffe was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Finance in 1986 and I do not doubt that he had an opportunity to change the scheme had he wished to do so. Deputy Dukes was the Minister for Finance at that time and former Deputy Barry Desmond was the Minister for Social Welfare. There may well have been some dispute between Deputy Dukes and Barry Desmond on the matter.</P>
      <P>In 1996, under Partnership 2000, the then Government could also have changed the scheme. I clearly recall that the scheme did not form part of Partnership 2000, particularly in regard to farmers. Deputy De Rossa was the Minister for Social Welfare at that time and Deputy Quinn was the Minister for Finance. There are practical difficulties associated with the extension of this scheme to the self-employed and they cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are already in place for self-employed people on low incomes through the unemployment assistance scheme and there is a substantial cost involved there. Deputy Broughan acknowledged my Committee Stage comment that this issue might be better addressed through the taxation system and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to examine the issue.</P>
      <P>On the matter of assistance for self-employed people who pass out of the back to work allowance scheme, it was stated that assistance was withdrawn after a period of two years when, in fact, assistance is provided for four years. A number of initiatives has been introduced to assist self-employed people &ndash; a training and technical fund is available to self-employed scheme participants to assist them in areas such as book-keeping and marketing and to assist in the purchase of equipment, and arrangements have also been put in place by my Department, in conjunction with the First Step organisation, to allow self-employed people to avail of interest free loans. Assistance is available to self-employed people under the back-to-work allowance scheme. I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I would have thought he would care as much about the self-employed, particularly those who are not well off, as I do. The Minister traced the origins of the scheme from 1984. I am proud to have been involved as a Minister of State in the Government which introduced the family income supplement. I accept that it was introduced for PAYE workers but I do not accept that it was never intended as income support for the general population. Circumstances have changed in the meantime and many back-to-work schemes are directed at get<Col N="871" /> ting people into self-employment as opposed to PAYE employment.</P>
      <P>The crunch issue is not getting people started in employment as support in this area is available. However, there is no reason someone leaving a back-to-work scheme three or four years later to paddle his or her own canoe should not receive the same benefits as a PAYE worker with a comparable income. The Minister referred to practical difficulties and I presume he is talking about Revenue problems and obtaining honest accounts. I see no reason properly produced accounts should not be acceptable to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the same way as they are now acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>If a scheme for the self-employed can work in Northern Ireland, why can it not work here? There is a cost involved and I quoted the figure of £47 million, excluding farmers and one of £80 million including them. This does not matter &ndash; it means the low income self-employed are being discriminated against as they are the same as low income PAYE workers with families. It is unfair and I will continue to campaign on this issue. In the meantime, all I can do is urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>This issue has been floating around since 1984 and no Government has done anything about it. As I said, there are practical difficulties but this Government has committed itself, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to examining the further development of the family income supplement and its payment through taxation rather than social welfare. Deputy Broughan agreed that it is probably better to deal with the entire population than a section of it. It is not true that the Government or I do not have sympathy for low income self-employed &ndash; of course we do. However, historically, this scheme was designed for PAYE workers. It needs to be radically reformed and we have committed ourselves to this in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The Minister shall consider the implications of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> (a) paying the respite care grant to all carers including those who are presently excluded by the means test,</P>
    <P>(b) increasing the present weekly income disregard to £250 per week, and</P>
    <P>(c) removing the disqualification whereby Carers in receipt of social welfare payments are effectively excluded from qualifying for a carers allowance,</P>
    <P>and shall report to Dáil Éireann thereon within 3 months of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The issue of carers is close to my heart. I put down this amendment in an effort to get the Minister to accept we are not doing enough for them. It goes without saying that we all, including the Minister, appreciate the work of carers. However, we should show our appreciation in a practical way along the lines proposed in my amendment. We must examine how a large number of carers providing full-time care for the elderly and disabled are getting no support from the State. We must look into our consciences and decide if we really appreciate the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>There is a change to carers' benefit in the Bill which will be of help to some but will not achieve as much as the Minister says. Despite that, two-thirds of carers will be left with no support. It is socially just and economically smart that we provide that support. This combination is an imperative for the Minister to get on his bike and do something. The problem is that the measures being taken are too little, too late. I am concerned that many carers will be unable to continue because of financial or other reasons and more people will be put in the care of the State and extra institutional costs will arise.</P>
    <P>I am pressing for the respite care grant to be given to all carers. The carers' organisations are seeking the payment of the carer's allowance without a means test. My heart is with them but I do not see that happening immediately. However, there is a strong case for some recognition for those who do not qualify under the means test. The payment of the respite care grant to all those presently excluded by the means test will be a step in the direction of abolishing the means test. The cost would not be enormous. It would recognise the work of those providing full-time care for the elderly and disabled and would cost about £300 per year which is less than £6 per week. As well as being an income support, it would benefit those who could take a short break from the constant care they provide. This is the approach to adopt for those who do not qualify under the restrictive means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister will tell us about all he has achieved in the past two or three years for carers. However, he has not improved the means test &ndash; the disregard of £150 still stands. This is the core issue. It is easier to work around the edges and increase respite care from £200 to £300. All these measures are good in their own way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has avoided the core issue; the real problem for carers who do not qualify for the carer's allowance is that they are totally excluded. It is important to consider if are we prepared to relax the means test which involves increasing the weekly disregard to £250 for married couples and £125 for single people. By doing so, the Minister would show he is committed to making a positive contribution to those just above the limit. It would include another 10,000 carers who are most in need and are receiving nothing. They would receive full or partial payment under this relaxation. That is the fundamental approach required on the way, hopefully, to abolishing the means test. I am not seeking the sun, moon and stars but a realistic instalment, an instalment the Government can afford.</P>
      <P>The last point I wish to raise grieves me. People on social welfare are effectively excluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance. The more one thinks of it, the more outrageous it is. The people who are generally regarded as the poorest, weakest and most vulnerable section of society are excluded from receiving the carer's allowance. The meanest aspect of the already mean means test is that if one is on social welfare, one does not qualify. The Minister can claim that, technically, I am not correct and that a social welfare recipient can qualify for the carer's allowance. However, one would have to give up one's existing allowance and therefore, effectively, one would not qualify for anything additional. How can that be justified? I read the report on the carer's allowance which made the anodyne, innocuous point that it is generally accepted that people on social welfare should not receive a second payment. Who accepts that? I do not accept it. Why should we effectively exclude the weakest and most vulnerable section of society from this payment? Who is excluded from receiving the carer's allowance? People who are regarded as being too well off if the income disregard of £150 per week knocks them out of the scheme and, at the bottom, those who have a social welfare payment. How can we justify operating a scheme in that fashion?</P>
      <P>The time is right for a radical review of the scheme. It is a good scheme. I tabled an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill ten or 12 years ago seeking the establishment of this scheme. It has developed well over the years and the Minister has made some improvements. However, let us now do what is right, just and economically sensible. Let us develop the scheme quickly. That is why I urge the Minister to accept the approach suggested in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for introducing the carer's benefit, although it did not justify the major publicity generated by its launch. It will be of benefit for some people but it is limited by the fact that it is only payable, in practical terms, to <Col N="874" /> a worker who gives up a job to provide care. The scheme could be improved by adoption of the approach outlined in amendment No. 17 whereby the payment could be made to the spouse or partner of the qualifying person with the agreement, obviously, of that person and the qualifying person. That would be a substantial improvement and would be economically wise. It would enable the qualifying person to continue working and allow the spouse or partner of that person to draw the benefit. The amendment is sensible and I hope the Minister will have a positive response.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main issues of concern with regard to the carer's allowance. I ask the Minister to offer serious commitments in response to the reasonable case I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that I or the Government have done little in this area. This scheme was started in 1990 and £100,000 was allocated for it in the Estimates. We estimate that by the end of this year the payment for carer's allowance will be £78 million. That is a dramatic increase in just ten years.</P>
      <P>When I was appointed to office the total payment on carer's allowance was approximately £36 million. During my tenure that increased to £78 million. I have heard comments by Members of the Opposition and the lobby groups that the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has not increased. That is incorrect. Since this Government took office just two and half years ago the figure has increased by 60% and we estimate that by the end of this year it will have increased further to between 17,000 and 18,000. The figure was 9,500 when we took office.</P>
      <P>The Deputy accused me of tinkering with the system. When one brings forward a scheme which deals primarily with a health issue but is administered through the social welfare code, which is designed for people on low incomes, the scheme might not develop in the way people expect. When we took office, the 9,500 carer's allowance recipients were not in receipt of the free schemes. They now qualify for all of them. The 17,000 to 18,000 recipients this year will also get the free schemes, something none of them received three years ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in stating that I have done nothing in relation to the income disregard. In 1999, I made changes whereby the first £150 of joint weekly income for married carers is not taken into account in the means test and the first £75 of weekly income is disregarded in respect of single carers. Much has been made of abolishing the means test. There is no social welfare payment&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not understand the changes that were made. He should check it. These changes benefited people and it is nearly two years since they were made.</P>
      <P>Some, although not all, lobby groups want the means test abolished. Child benefit is the only social welfare scheme that is not subject to means test. It is a universal scheme. It is paid to every family irrespective of income. The richest and poorest people get the same child benefit. Every other social welfare scheme is means tested. They are means tested to ensure the money available to the State through the social welfare system is paid to the people who are most in need, low income families. It is unjust that a a person on a big salary or with a high income should be entitled to a carer's allowance equivalent to somebody on a very low income. Abolition of the means test means spreading the load. It reduces the amount of money that is available to target people on low income. Whether it is a reflection of a socialist leaning in me or my type of politics, I believe that if millions of pounds are available they should be targeted at those who cannot afford to care for somebody in the home. No one side of the House holds a monopoly of regard for carers &ndash; we all have regard for them. No matter who is in Government on this side of the House, the request to abolish the means test will not be entertained because the strongest advice given to any Minister in my position is that it should not be done and that funding should be targeted at those most in need.</P>
      <P>I instigated a review of the carer's allowance because in the space of ten years it has increased from £100,000 initially to £78 million. The review was published 18 months ago and I am glad Deputy O'Keeffe read it since Committee Stage. I suggested he do so. He will acknowledge that all but one of its recommendations have been implemented. Indeed, we have gone further. All the lobby groups involved in this area had an input to the review. As Minister I gave a commitment to implement its recommendations as quickly as possible and I did so over two budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moves are afoot in regard to the continual care payment, linked to the needs assessment issue, of which the Deputy is aware. I would like to think action will be taken sooner rather than later, but Deputies will appreciate it is a difficult area. The payment is made to people based on a doctor's note and it does not take into account the degree of necessity or need by both the carer and the those cared for. In view of the fact that all other <Col N="876" /> recommendations of the carer's allowance scheme have now been implemented, I have made a commitment to look at the issue of income disregard over the next few budgets with a view to increasing it so as to include more people.</P>
    <P>I cannot accede to some of the issues raised in the amendments, but they will be looked at in the context of next year's budget. The issue of whether somebody could qualify for two social welfare payments was looked at. It is a principle of social welfare that a person cannot avail of two payments and the Deputy is incorrect when he says there would be no benefit to somebody going on carer's allowance. It is a fact that somebody would qualify for a higher rate of payment, perhaps not as much as they would like.</P>
    <P>This scheme was never designed to compensate or pay people for minding people in their home. The State would never be able to afford that, nor to introduce a system to that effect. It was designed to assist the people on low income who are caring for people in their home. I referred to the cost of caring allowance, under the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It will be looked at as a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>Any objective look at the carer's allowance scheme over the past two and a half years will show that by far the most changes have been made during my tenure as Minister. We will not stop there. Between now and the end of the term of office of the Government in two years we will have made other significant changes, not only in the area of social welfare but also in finance, where over two budgets we have already introduced changes to caring in the home. We have also dramatically increased the disabled person's grants under the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The issue of carers primarily rests with the Department of Health and Children. Substantial funding has been allocated to assist not only carers but especially those cared for, who are the people in need, especially the people with disabilities. Substantial additional funding has been allocated in the past two years, especially in the last budget. We aim to continue with this for the remainder of our term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is floundering on the issue of the carer's allowance. He has contradicted himself. He says he cannot agree with the principle of abolishing the means test because that would result in a universal payment with the result that people who are too well off would get the allowance. He also says he wants to focus payments on low income families, yet the lowest income families, those on social welfare, are totally excluded and will continue to be excluded. It is true that somebody on social welfare can change their existing welfare payment to a carer's allowance if it provides a marginal improvement, but they lose their existing allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The Minister is not credible on this issue. It is one I intend to pursue relentlessly because it has given rise to huge unfairness and injustice. I agree with the Minister that while it would be good to have no means test, that must not be the focus, at least initially. It can be supported at a later stage. In the short term, the focus should be on those who need it financially.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the poorest people are excluded from the carer's allowance. The position with regard to those just above the limit is also wrong because the Minister has not increased the £150 disregard, although he has tinkered around in the middle. It is wrong that those who are caught by that limit continue to be caught.</P>
    <P>In pressing this amendment I must say I am glad the scheme has developed because it is a very good one. I am also glad the Minister has made the free schemes available to perhaps the third of the people who will qualify for them. However, my heart bleeds for the two-thirds or three-quarters of people who qualify for nothing. I will press this amendment and I intend to relentlessly pursue the Minister on these issues.</P>

      <P>In my earlier reference to this amendment I did not refer to a major change to the carer's benefit, which I introduced. Deputy O'Keeffe suggested it may not affect too many people. It is built into the question of whether there should be a means test for the carer's allowance. The carer's benefit is not means tested and we conservatively estimate that about 6,600 people will gain from the scheme. One of the reasons I chose to put many of my eggs into this basket this year was to get the foot in the door, as was done in 1990 with the carer's allowance for which an estimate of £100,000 was given then and which has since risen to £78 million. The carer's benefit is a very important scheme and, once it is up and running, it will stand the test of time, especially given that so many people are now in the workplace. There have been huge changes from 1990 to 2000. In 1990, only one million people were working and now 1.7 million are at work. Obviously many more people will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy O'Keeffe's criticism. I am prepared to stand on my record which has been second to none. When I leave office, I have no doubt that more will be done in this area. I accept that more needs to be done but it requires a broader examination of this area. That is one of the reasons I recently established a structure between myself and the Minister for Health and Children to examine the medium to long-term issues of caring for an aging population. I have already said that the Government took an incredibly strategic decision in putting money aside for pensions for the future. We must also examine caring for the growing elderly population into the future. That is one of the reasons we should examine this and see if there are other areas of assistance which can be given to people, such as releasing equity in houses or the German system <Col N="878" /> where people are entitled to take out insurance policies to cover any care they might need.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&ndash;The Minister shall, having regard to the financial difficulties encountered by widows and widowers, prepare a report and lay same before Dáil Éireann on the feasibility of extending to all widows and widowers&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the Free Travel Pass,</P>
      <P>(b) the Free Electricity Allowance, and</P>
      <P>(c) the Free Telephone Rental Allowance,</P>
      <P>which report should also review the possibility of a special increased payment to widows and widowers who have no other source of income other than Social Welfare.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with a section of our society who are forgotten to a large degree and neglected to some degree, namely, widows and widowers. Improvements which have been made have largely passed by widows and widowers who are entitled at this stage to a little more of the national cake. It is not that their demands are enormous or that they are marching on Leinster House, but taking into account the difficulties many of them suffer as a result of the loss of their spouse and the consequent financial problems which often occur, we should do more for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis, I examined an approach which was practical, would provide assistance and would not be too expensive. I would like to provide that assistance now and then examine the situation again to see if more could be done. Providing the free travel pass to widows and widowers would not cost too much. Neither would it cost too much <Col N="879" /> if we were to provide some support through the free electricity allowance. That would be a help in many cases, as indeed would be the free telephone rental allowance. These are good and worthy schemes which are availed of by many elderly and some disabled people. Consideration could be given at this stage to extending those schemes to widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could examine the possibility of some further payments to widows and widowers where they have no source of income other than social welfare. I am firmly convinced that there are many in those circumstances who are in hardship. If that is so, surely there is a duty on us to examine what can be done to relieve that hardship. Anomalies also exist in that regard which have not been resolved. If people are over 60 when their spouse dies and that spouse availed of the free schemes, the surviving partner can continue to receive those schemes. However, if they are 59 when their spouse dies, they are not entitled to avail of the schemes when they reach 60 unless they can prove their late spouse availed of them. Anomalies exist which need to be remedied.</P>
    <P>What is needed at this stage and what I would hope to secure from the Minister is a political commitment to upgrade the position of widows and widowers in the list of priorities. We should examine the situation to see how we can provide a helping hand where the Government has a great deal of money, not enough of which is being given to the Minister. It is important to get the Minister on board at this stage and, if the political will exists to try to find a new and better deal for widows, we should work towards that. That is the purpose of the amendment. I do not expect the Minister to immediately accept the approach I adopt but, if he were prepared to give a commitment to work towards that approach, perhaps progress could then be made. I urge the Minister to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his words on this issue. I acknowledge what he said. My parliamentary party has been vociferous on this issue in the past year and, as a result of those representations and representations from all parties in the House, I agreed to examine the issue of giving some assistance to widows. In the previous budget I raised the bereavement grant from £100 to £500 which would have helped widows and all families who were bereaved. In this budget, of which this Bill is a part, I brought forward a special bereavement grant for widows with children which was my response to those representations which have been made in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I examined the issue of extending the free schemes and a number of other proposals which we might have been able to deliver. However, there were difficulties in all those areas primarily because, if widows were to be cared for, it would discriminate against other single parent families who would feel justified in pointing out that special <Col N="880" /> circumstances relating to widows were being cared for and they were not, although they were in a similar situation, something which might make them feel aggrieved. Given the issue of equality of social welfare payments, the strong advice is that we cannot do anything to segregate widows without having some knock-on implications for other groups, such as lone parents. I assure the Deputy it is a high priority on my agenda to look at this issue over the next two budgets. I do not know if we can crack the nut without equality implications, although I am not using that as an excuse. We tried to examine all these issues and the best we could come up with this year is that from 1 December widows with children will be entitled to a once-off payment of £1,500 on the death of their spouse. This is a small help to them at their time of bereavement. We also made other changes subsequent to the budget which are part of this Bill, including eliminating the anomaly associated with the extra social welfare payment for six weeks after the death of a spouse. We will continue to make such changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take away from the changes the Minister has introduced but they only apply to new widows and widowers not to existing ones. I am like Oliver Twist in that I am looking for more. The benefits are good for someone who lost their spouse since last December but they are of no benefit to those who became widows or widowers before that.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's point about the equality of social welfare payments. An answer will always be found if the political will exists. One will find an inequality if one is looking for an excuse not to do something. There are inequalities and anomalies, for example, in child dependant allowances. Deputy McGrath is familiar with the three different rates of child dependant allowance. The child dependant allowance payable to a widow is less than the child dependant allowances payable otherwise.</P>
      <P>If we want to tackle this issue and to provide additional support for widows and widowers, it can be done if the political will is there and we are prepared to allocate resources to it. The Minister was laid back in his statement about what he might do over the next two budgets. However, I do not expect him to be around for the next two budgets and that is part of his problem. If the Minister is committed to doing something for widows and widowers, he should do so now.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Keeffe. This is an important issue. Last week I met a widow in my supermarket who is the mother of five children but she cannot work as she will lose her pension entitlement. She needs financial help but she is not entitled to any free schemes. Widows and widowers should be treated equally in terms of the free travel pass, free electricity and the telephone rental allowance. A single parent needs assistance to maintain their home and family. <Col N="881" /> This issue has caused unease. The Minister indicated that senior citizens will get the benefits accruing from pension entitlements. This issue, which has been neglected by successive Governments, needs the Minister's urgent attention. There is an opportunity now that there are millions of pounds in the coffers to help single parents. We should use the State's resources to extend the free schemes to widows and widowers.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support Deputies O'Keeffe and Perry. No category of people is more special than the young widow who has lost her spouse at short notice and has been left with a few children. When the initial sympathies have been extended, the number of people coming to the door peters out and the community solidarity which is part of the bereavement process trickles away, and she is left on her own. She is then faced with the raw reality of her financial circumstances and the fact she is totally dependent on either a non-contributory or a contributory widow's pension.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that over the years attempts have been made to try to bring the level of contributory or non-contributory widow's pension up to an acceptable level. However, it is still extremely modest by any standards. A considerable amount of enterprise and ingenuity are required to keep body and soul together during a bereavement. We want the Minister to make a minor gesture.</P>
      <P>I recently floated this idea on a local radio station. Of all the issues I have raised, none provoked such comment as this one. Widows rang the local radio station to give their personal anecdotal experiences of how difficult it is to survive on a contributory or non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a free electricity allowance of 200 units during the summer and 300 units during the winter. This might seem insignificant to us but not to a widow on a widow's pension. We are also talking about free telephone rental, not calls, to enable them to afford a telephone. They would then be able to decide who to ring and to receive calls from friends. Free travel would be a significant but relatively cost free gesture which would make the life of a young widow more tolerable. How much of a burden will 200 units of free electricity in the summer and 300 units in the winter, a free travel pass and free telephone rental impose on the Exchequer? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at one area of free travel which is anomalous. If a person has a free travel pass based on his old age pension, invalidity pension or any other form of social welfare, he is entitled to a companion pass. He could bring an assigned child with him if he does not have a spouse on an old age pension. However, a widow is not entitled to such a pass. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of a free travel pass for widows and to assign a companion pass to widows <Col N="882" /> to enable them to travel with one of their children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concession to remove the anomaly where one widow can retain the allowances and free schemes of her spouse and another widow cannot. This point has been conceded in terms of allowing all widows over 60 years of age, irrespective of whether the deceased spouse was in receipt of the allowance, to have free travel, electricity and telephone rental. The extension of the companion pass to widows in such circumstances to enable them to be accompanied by a child would be another important concession. If it applies to old age pensioners I cannot understand why it should not also apply to widows who will now benefit from concessions introduced by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received special pleading for certain categories but no category has a more just case than widows or widowers who have lost a spouse and who are plunged into the darkness of trying to cope on their own and on a social welfare pension. However, we must acknowledge that considerable increases have come on stream in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In yesterday's UK budget, a huge concession was made to give free television licences to people over 75 years of age. For years, people over 65 in Ireland have received all the free schemes which is worth about £13 to £14 per week per person. This Bill proposes that people over 75 years of age will be entitled to all the free schemes as of right, irrespective of household income or composition, or whether they are on social welfare. Our record in this regard shows that we are way ahead of the UK.</P>
      <P>I have received representations concerning widows, particularly from my parliamentary party. We examined what we could or could not do and decided in favour of the £1,000 bereavement grant for widows with children. Invariably such widows are young. I accept the Deputy's comment that this will only apply to widows from now on and that more needs to be done. However, it would cost about £25 million to extend the free schemes to 37,000 widows under 66 years of age. In addition, one could not just extend the schemes to widows. It would also have to apply to deserted wives and one-parent families, otherwise the State would be left open to accusations of treating one type of family unit differently to other family units. To extend the schemes to lone parents, single parents and deserted wives would cost an estimated £40 million extra. This would bring the total cost to £65 million which is not an inconsiderable sum of money. However, I will look at this issue in the run up to the next budget.</P>

      <P>I am pleasantly surprised that the total cost is so manageable. If we can offer the support I outlined to 37,000 widows for £25 million per year then that would be a reasonable price tag. If, for equality reasons, we extend this <Col N="883" /> support to single parents and deserted wives for an additional £40 million, this shows that the figures are manageable. We are not talking about hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 6 months from the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effects of the new means test on the assessment of capital (provided for under the Third Schedule to the Principal Act) and any anomalies thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the new means test. For some time I have been seeking substantial reform of the inequitable means test. I am glad this campaign has been successful and that the Minister has introduced a new scheme. However, I am concerned that there may still be injustices, anomalies and inequities in the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating an approach which involves the Minister laying a report before the Houses within six months, and we usually use this mechanism to get around difficulties caused by amendments which place a charge on the Exchequer. However, I would like to see a report on the operation of the new means test. This test should be fair and just and I am concerned about the artificial nature of its construction which may give rise to anomalies and unfairness. I accept that the new test is an improvement but I am seeking to <Col N="884" /> ensure that it is monitored and reviewed and that we examine it in six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than agreeing to the amendment, the social affairs committee could look at this issue in six months. There are not any explicit assessment rates under the new system. However, the effective assessment rates for those with capital above the higher disregards would, in the majority of cases, be lower than under the existing system. For example, a single person with capital of £20,000 would be assessed at 2.6% as opposed to 6.75% at present; a single person with capital of £30,000 would be assessed at 5.2% as opposed to 9%; a couple with £40,000 would be assessed at 2.6% as opposed to 3.4% while a couple with £80,000 would be assessed at 4.55%.</P>
      <P>We carried out a sample survey and found that only a small number of pensioners had income over a certain limit and that only 0.6% of pensioners would have amounts high enough to be assessed at the top rate of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, the figure with which Deputy O'Keeffe has the biggest problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposals would not be of any benefit to about 99% of pensioners who would be well below the threshold at which the £4 assessment applies. However, the committee might examine this issue. This is one of the best changes in the Bill because it will mean that people throughout the social welfare system will be entitled to hold a substantial amount of capital and still retain their social welfare payments. It will obviate the necessity for people to keep money at home and will encourage older people and those in receipt of social welfare to deposit it in a bank, building society or credit union.</P>

      <P>In page 18, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall consider the possibility of exempting the first £2,000 of income derived from forestry premium and shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on this issue.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the forestry premiums which are normally paid to small farmers who are prepared to devote part of their land to forestry. It is a national objective to encourage more forestry and it is a national objective to involve more farmers as opposed to outside investors. For those reasons I am in favour of the forestry premium approach. The problem is that the forestry premium is counted as income in the means test. It could be argued that is not a bad thing. REPS payments, however, which are also paid to achieve a policy objective, are not taken into account. I do not see any difference between a forestry premium and a REPS payment. If one can be disregarded why not the other? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> On Committee Stage the Minister offered theological explanations of income support as opposed to special payment compensation. The Jesuits would have been at home arguing the technical and theological points he raised but, in practical terms, there is no difference. In both REPS and forestry premiums we are trying to achieve a national policy objective by encouraging farmers to become involved.</P>
    <P>The recipients are generally small farmers for whom the question of a pension can be very important. When I was practising law, I recall many older people from rural areas telling me they were &ldquo;heading for the book&rdquo;, meaning the pension. It means a great deal to them that they can receive it. If, however, they are excluded from the non-contributory old age pension because they have been involved in forestry, having responded to the urgings of the Government, it is unfair. Their next door neighbour may get a pension because he got a REPS payment instead of a forestry premium. I urge the Minister to re-examine the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Afforestation is a long-term investment. Planting may have taken place 20 years ago. The forestry premiums were promoted as a tax free fund. If REPS payments do not affect entitlement, the forestry premium, particularly when the Government encouraged people to plant areas which were of no agricultural use, should also not affect entitlement. It was a sensible investment and to penalise people for following that initiative by affecting their pension entitlements is wrong. The REPS payments are not taken into consideration; the same should be the case for any premium funded by the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The forest premium scheme is designed to provide an income from forestry during the period the forest is developing &ndash; for the first 20 years, for example. Payments under the forest premium scheme would equate to other forms of farm income. The forest premium is unlike REPS and compensation payments under SACs. These latter payments compensate farmers for the material and work involved, or farming income foregone, in complying with agri-environmental plans or SAC conditions for which special income disregards are already applied under the farm assist scheme. There is a difference.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is money in the hand but, under the social welfare code, we must treat it in the same way as other forms of farm income, for example, income from ordinary farm activities or headage payments. It is, therefore, properly assessable for means testing under social welfare payments. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the Minister at all. I am glad he has accepted criticism and is now moving in the direction we indicated a year ago. I warned of the practical implications of the original farm assist scheme and said that many farmers would rue the day the Minister introduced it. Unfortunately, my predictions have been fulfilled. Of the 7,310 people who were in receipt of these payments in December 1998, more than 1,000 were removed from the scheme under the new farm assist scheme introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The situation has improved somewhat, but I am concerned that reducing the figure to 70% will not be enough. If that is the best we can get from the Minister at this stage, I will continue to return to this issue until all of those who were removed from the scheme are receiving payment again. It was the wrong thing to do when cattle prices were falling and small farmers were suffering. The Minister cannot wash his hands of responsibility for this. There has been some improvement but we will want to see more.</P>

It was made clear to the farming organisations that there would be a reassessment of all incomes once we introduced the farm assist scheme. There were farmers in receipt of social welfare based on old income assessments when their incomes had since changed. This is a good scheme and this year the numbers receiving payments under it will increase dramatically. That has been acknowledged by the farming organisations.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann disapproves of the decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to sanction increases in Land Registry charges and deplores the unreasonable delays in processing Land Registry applications which have given rise to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;a record backlog of over 80,000 applications pending at the end of 1999;</P>
      <P>&ndash;a refusal to deal with telephone queries in respect of applications from Counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wicklow, except between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. each day;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;unnecessary delays and costs for purchasers of sites, new homes, commercial enterprises and applicants for various retirement pensions and calls on the Minister for <Col N="888" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform to defer the approved increases in charges until:</P>
    <P>&ndash;adequate additional staff are assigned to Land Registry in order to guarantee that all applications for new registration which are in order will be completed within a maximum of four months;</P>
    <P>&ndash;all routine sub-divisions will be completed within two months;</P>
    <P>&ndash;other Land Registry services are modernised and streamlined immediately,</P>
    <P>and further calls on the Minister to decentralise the Land Registry so that applications from the surrounding catchment counties will henceforth be dealt with by newly established Land Registry offices in the regions.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The poor performance of the Land Registry is reflected in the figures. The intake of transactions has increased from 91,060 in 1993 to 133,000 in 1999. At the end of 1999, there was an arrears of 86,084 applications. While the Minister will contend that there have been considerable increases in efficiency and that there is an overall increase of 20% in output of applications, the waiting times for many counties is unreasonable and unsustainable and the situation is getting progressively worse.</P>
      <P>Counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford have waiting times for processing of Land Registry dealings of up to 65 weeks. The waiting time for Counties Laois, Offaly and Tipperary is 62 weeks while files in the cases of Mayo and Sligo are not being processed for up to 60 weeks. In the case of Cork, the waiting period is 50 weeks.</P>
      <P>Last January the Land Registry inserted a series of advertisements in national newspapers notifying the public that telephone inquiries for Counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wicklow would only be dealt with between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. each day. That restriction is still in place.</P>
      <P>The problem in the Land Registry, I acknowledge, did not begin today or yesterday. The problems have been obvious for a considerable period but the situation has become intolerable over the past three years, in particular. A 44% increase in transactions over an eight year span should have met with an adequate response in terms of resources and staffing levels and yet nothing was done on this front. Although there were 40,000 additional transactions, the staff figure remained static at 525.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 February the Minister announced in the Dáil that he had received sanction from the Department of Finance for an additional allocation of core staff to the Land Registry. <Col N="889" /> However, the situation continues to deteriorate. On the one hand, the Government has launched a new national development plan, a very ambitious plan which everybody welcomes. It is a seven year programme for economic and social development involving the spending of a massive £33.5 billion. On the other hand, one of the basic services in the State, the registration of the ownership of property, is in chaos because the Government has failed to assign adequate staff and resources to cope with the increased workload. It has failed to modernise and streamline procedures and has failed to introduce the type of technology urgently needed to provide the efficient level of service to which people are entitled.</P>
    <P>The ownership of land and property is something which is deeply rooted and etched in the Irish personality and psyche. The very purpose of the Land Registry is to make available a secure, reliable and effective legal system for registering ownership of property. It has a crucial role in the finalising of financial transactions. The Land Registry, however, in its present form does not provide the efficient service a modern state needs and it is so hopelessly unable to cope with the current increased pressures, workloads and demands that one can only imagine how much more chaotic the situation will be in the context of the additional pressures, expectations and demands which will ensue from the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Even the most routine of services are not being delivered. There is no reason, for example, a file plan should not be sent by return of post. Yet if one asks a solicitor anywhere in the country what the situation is, she or he will tell one that instead of a return of post service, it now takes up to four months for the Land Registry to return such a simple transaction.</P>
    <P>I read a speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, when she deputised for the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, at a seminar hosted by the Irish Institute of Surveyors last year and which examined the need for change and the updating of the present land registration system. The Minister of State said the roar of the Celtic tiger has been heard in the Land Registry arising out of the recent buoyancy in the property market. While the roar might have been heard in the Land Registry, it has not been heeded at Government level.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of young couples are being denied ownership of their homes because of the delays they have encountered with the Land Registry. Many are alarmed to learn that many months after they have parted with their hard earned cash or their mortgage, they are still not the legal owners of their property. The Minister will know from his own experience that section 25 of the 1965 Act lays down a stipulation that six months from the completion of the procedure of applying for land registry is the maximum period, in other words, unless one gets it done within that six <Col N="890" /> month period, one does not own one's property and has to go cap in hand looking for an extension. The same difficulties are being experienced by people trying to sell on their houses and their land because of the delays they experience in obtaining legal title. Again, major difficulties are being encountered by people endeavouring to obtain top up loans for extensions to their houses or their properties.</P>
    <P>Take the situation of a developer who buys 200 acres of land to build 1,000 houses. First, the present planning process will almost certainly ensure that any ambitious time scale can be thrown out the window. Parallel with the planning difficulties, it often takes up to three years, in some cases, to sort out the title of the property. There is something seriously wrong with a system which is so bogged down that it can take years to get sites into shape in terms of establishing exact title. In the meantime, the developer cannot proceed with the development and he certainly cannot dispose of the houses until clearance of title has been obtained. Again, business transactions which involve ownership and registration of property are being delayed and frustrated with obvious consequences for all involved.</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty for farmers who opt for the farm retirement scheme. This is an excellent and commendable scheme to enable aging farmers to receive a retirement pension from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in advance of the normal retirement age and, in so doing, to transfer the land by way of lease, agreement or transfer of ownership to a young person.</P>
    <P>Land Registry delays are causing major problems for donors and recipients. This excellent scheme sponsored by a Government Department is encountering major delays, frustrations and difficulties because yet another Government agency, in this case the Land Registry, is failing to deliver a service in time.</P>
    <P>There was a palpable sense of disbelief when it was announced last December that a decision had been taken and approved by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that two new fees orders were to be made, one for the Land Registry and one for the Registry of Deeds. The Registry of Deeds fees came into effect on 1 February last and the increase in Land Registry fees will come into effect on 1 May next. To introduce such increases in Land Registry fees in light of the crisis that exists and is getting increasingly worse illustrates how out of touch the Minister is with the situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister will undoubtedly argue that fees have not increased since 1991 and that may well be the case, but nobody could justify any increase in Land Registry charges until such time as the service is vastly improved and delivery dates are brought forward substantially. To increase Land Registry charges by 20% or 30% depending on the nature of the service is unfair, indefensible and irresponsible. I note that the Minister told the House during Question Time on 7 May last <Col N="891" /> that there was no formal consultation with the Law Society. He went on to state that he understood the society would have been aware from routine discussions with senior management of the registry that the fees were under review and that the society was free to make whatever representations it deemed appropriate. There would seem to be an underlying implication in the Minister's remarks that the Law Society was in some way aware of the scale of the increases and that it was accepting of them.</P>
    <P>Was an article under the heading &ldquo;Law Society describes backlog of Land Registry as a national disgrace&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 18 January last or a similar article with similar comments in yesterday's edition of that newspaper brought to his attention? The Director General of the Law Society, Mr. Ken Murphy was quoted as describing the backlog of delays in the Land Registry as a &ldquo;national embarrassment which is causing a great deal of frustration and annoyance&rdquo; and as spelling out the various new charges for registering property, charges of £300, £400 or £500 depending on the value of the transaction, whereas previously there was a blanket flat rate of £250 for any property valued at more than £30,000. It is not only a question of a charge of £300, £400 or £500, if the construction of a new house is involved and a new folio has to be opened as is generally the case, a further £50 will be charged while a mortgage will also have an additional fee of £100. For any young couple building a house, we are talking about a charge of £450 minimum instead of one of £250 as it was heretofore for a service that is not being delivered.</P>
    <P>For that reason Fine Gael calls on the Minister to defer his order to bring in the new charges on 1 May until adequate additional staff are assigned to the Land Registry. We are talking about specialist personnel. There seems to be a gross shortage of trained legal personnel and additional specialist staff for the mapping section. An increase in charges should not be contemplated until such staff are in place and certain reasonable minimum target deadlines are achieved.</P>
    <P>In particular, the motion proposes that all applications for new registrations should be completed within four months provided the files and applications are in order. With adequate trained staff, there is no reason that deadline cannot be routinely met. We propose that all route sub-divisions should be completed within a two month maximum deadline. Where a father hands over a site to a daughter or a son, there is no reason such registration should not be completed within a two month period.</P>
    <P>We are living in an era of incredible advances in the capacity of information technology. With the type of progress that has transformed so many different sectors of business and commerce and with the e-commerce revolution, these standards should be the norm in the Land Registry. I appreciate there has been some investment in computerisation, but I note from the Minister of <Col N="892" /> State's address to the Irish Institute of Surveyors, to which I alluded previously, that she referred to a feasibility study on the future of digital mapping and that is in the process of being undertaken. In light of the current crisis and chaos in the Land Registry and in the context of present demands, one would imagine that this process should have moved beyond the realm of a feasibility study. I ask the Minister to indicate to the House whether the feasibility study has been completed, if so, what recommendations are contained in it and if they are to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has proposals to convert the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to a commercial semi-State body. According to the Minister, the new organisation will be expected to operate in a commercial environment and it will be critical to have regard to the costs of providing the services and the need to ensure that the new organisation is placed on a sound, commercial and financial footing. The Land Registry makes an annual profit of approximately £3.5 million. If the Land Registry can make a profit of £3.5 million annually in its current ramshackle state, is it not obvious that it would have major commercial potential if it was properly managed, streamlined, revamped and modernised? Surely it could quite easily double that profit if it was streamlined and made more efficient. What is needed is to make the service more efficient, to increase the turnover of successful transactions and thereby enhance the profit without any necessity to have recourse to increases in fees or charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister justifies the change to semi-State status in order to introduce competition. What competition are we talking about? One must acknowledge there is only one Land Registry and it operates as a monopoly. From where, therefore, will the competition come? I do not necessarily support the concept of converting the Land Registry into a commercial semi-State body. Is this the direction in which we should be moving, given that would mean that a very important service that deals with people's property rights would not be answerable to anybody, not least to this House? In that regard, all one need do is check the Order Paper on any day and one would find between 25 and 30 questions tabled by Deputies around the country asking what progress has been made on applications to the Land Registry for registration. In a new situation will we be denied access to fundamental questions and information on the Land Registry? I would have major reservations if the Minister brings forward that proposal. I would like him to spell out precisely the merits of the new changes. What will converting the Land Registry into a semi-State organisation achieve that cannot be achieved by restructuring, modernising and giving the existing organisation additional trained staff and resources? </P>
    <P>The Minister stated that &ldquo;In the commercial world they will seek market prices to ensure that their business is competitive and that they will be <Col N="893" /> able to pay their staff and purchase the necessary equipment.&rdquo;  That indication by the Minister has a ominous ring and it seems to hint that additional increases are being envisaged to meet the market prices. What is needed here is reinvestment of the existing profits to provide the necessary equipment, staff and level of performance to generate more income by way of a better service. What is needed here is a larger turnover of transactions and, consequently, a higher level of profit rather than introducing unnecessary punitive charges. Do we need two separate agencies, the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds? The Minister may tell us a dual system is not uncommon, that such a system operates in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Greece, Germany, Finland and Luxembourg. Nevertheless there are extremely efficient land registry systems with only one agency in Australia and the United States. Before we proceed, it would be well worth while examining the very efficient Code Napoleon which operates in France. I ask the Minister to consider the merits of the motion and look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, I declare my interest. I support the motion. My colleague, Deputy Higgins, has confirmed that the backlog in the Land Registry is currently running at 85,000. I tabled a parliamentary question in the early 1990s in reply to which the Minister for Justice of the day confirmed that there was a backlog of 58,000. I described it as a national scandal at the time. In the technologically advanced era we just have to switch the figures around; the backlog of 58,000 has become a backlog of 85,000. I hope the Minister agrees this is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>It appears that value for money does not feature as a priority for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as far as the Land Registry is concerned. The service is inadequate and the era of Charles Dickens will continue until such time as the Land Registry is fundamentally and radically reformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the introduction of modern technological equipment in some sections of the Land Registry, the service has deteriorated considerably. The entire area of land transfer and conveyancing should be simplified and streamlined rather than made more bureaucratic and complex. I wonder what the Minister has in mind, for example, on the extension of certain sections of the Registration of Title Act which was passed in the early 1960s? We still have compulsory registration applicable to only three counties in the entire country. When will the Minister think in terms of extending its application to the entire country? When will he think in terms of extending the value for money on the solicitor's certificate on a first registration conveyance from the present grossly inadequate sum. The proposed fees order should be suspended immedi<Col N="894" /> ately pending the introduction of a more consumer-friendly regime.</P>
    <P>I speak of the situation in Waterford which I know best. Waterford is simply not working for the midland counties. I urge the Minister to remove the Leinster counties from Waterford and relocate them to the midlands. The necessity of having a stamp office near the Land Registry Office in Waterford is something I have brought up here time and time again, and it has not happened. To stamp a dealing in the midlands now, one has to drive to the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin with the document and subsequently drive or get a train or a bus to Waterford to register the document. We are talking about a service which is supposed to be consumer-friendly. The public counter in Waterford is staffed by only three people, which appears to be grossly insufficient having regard to the amount of work undertaken. I do not blame the staff. They have a very difficult job. They are under severe pressure. They are doing the best they can, but there are not sufficient of them.</P>
    <P>The training available in Waterford is by no means as comprehensive as it should be. There are people engaging in work in Waterford who do not have an appropriate level of training. There is no checking of dealings at the public counter, for example, as has been the case for years in Dublin. A requisition for a copy instrument to up-stamp a mortgage can take weeks as all the instruments are still stored in the Setanta Centre in Dublin. It takes a week to bring them down to Waterford and they will be released in Waterford only if somebody attends in person to sign. This is grossly inefficient.</P>
    <P>Delays are causing problems to landowners and house purchasers. In farm retirement cases there is a different regime in the context of Land Registry certification to that which obtains in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for pension purposes. Why does this happen? Can the Minister explain why in respect of a pension from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development a different set of conditions apply to certification from the Land Registry than for a pension from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? </P>
    <P>In regard to section 49 applications for first registration, some are taking three, four and five years to complete, which again is unsustainable in the Ireland of the new millennium. It is extraordinary when elected Members of a national assembly have to table parliamentary questions to the Minister of the day before they can get a reply on what is happening in relation to a dealing, a house purchase or a land purchase, for which full value has been paid by a purchaser. That underlines the ridiculous nature of the set-up within the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take action. I cannot understand how, having been in office for two and a half years, the Minister has allowed the situation to deteriorate to this extent. Instead of acting on the matter, he has added insult to injury <Col N="895" /> in respect of the already long-suffering public, by upping the fees in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister and my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, I declare my interest as a member of the Law Society.</P>
      <P>The proposal to increase Land Registry fees is a supreme example of the Government ripping off house purchasers while expressing concern about the additional burdens being placed on them. The increase in Land Registry fees will impact on every house buyer. In some instances their registration costs will be more than doubled. Their problems with higher house prices will be compounded by the extra expense of registering their title, compliments of this Government.</P>
      <P>We have had the Bacon report. We have heard cries of concern from this Government about rising house prices. While shedding crocodile tears about the plight of house buyers, the Government, which is supposed to be doing something about the problems, jacks up the fees in the one area where it has direct control over costs. What is the explanation? It is not that the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds are running at a loss. These fees are being increased against a background where the Government is making more and more profit from registration. The surplus in 1998 was £3,323,000, a nice hefty sum. The Land Registry has done well in producing such a huge surplus for the Exchequer. In 1999 profits jumped to £5,886,000. Again, well done to the registry. However, the Government has decided not to spend that enormous surplus and allow the Land Registry to put into effect the changes it has long proposed, but to further fatten the golden goose at the expense of house buyers over whom it has been shedding crocodile tears for the past year or two. It is not satisfied with its £6 million surplus in 1999. It wants more so it intends to increase the charges to take in even more revenue, make even more profit, have an even bigger surplus and put an even bigger burden on unfortunate house buyers. How can that be justified?</P>
      <P>The clue is in the Government's amendment. It considers it necessary to fatten the golden goose even further. It considers it a fully justifiable step in the context of the preparation of the registry for conversion to commercial semi-State status. We now know where the Government's priority lies. We now know that unfortunate house buyers do not feature in the Government priorities. They must stand aside because of the Government's decision to float the Land Registry on the commercial market and bring in a fat sum to the Exchequer as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to offer some advice to the Minister on this issue. If he intends to proceed with a conversion to a commercial semi-State body, and I have heard talk of such a move since I entered the House many years ago, there is a need for an efficient registry. If one wants an efficient registry, it must be properly resourced. I do not point the finger at the registry for its defects and short<Col N="896" /> comings. It has pleaded for more staff for a long time. Will the Minister explain why it has not been allocated more staff? He will talk about the economic buoyancy and the increasing number of applications tumbling into the Land Registry, which also leads to a consequent increase in fees. However, the registrar made a reasonable request a long time ago &ndash; perhaps even 18 months ago &ndash; for additional staff. Why has the registry not been allocated those staff?</P>
    <P>When parliamentary questions were tabled on the matter, the response was that the Minister was making representations to the Minister for Finance. There is a stupid situation where the registry, which is generating enormous profit for the State, cannot deliver a service because it cannot take on extra staff. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who finally shook himself and agreed it needed more staff, cannot give the 'go ahead' either. He must go to Merrion Square and seek approval from the Minister for Finance who will sit on the matter for another long period of time. This is a bad way to do business and the Minister should know it.</P>
    <P>It would take a long time to say everything that needs to be said about this matter but I have only a short time before I must hand over to my esteemed legal and political colleague, Deputy Enright. The Government has done a ferociously bad job as far as the registry is concerned. The blundering of the Government in relation to the Land Registry is compounded by its failure to respond when additional staff were requested to cope with the enormous backlog of applications. Delays with regard to some applications are now running at up to two years and they are longer with regard to section 49 applications. The consequence is a log jam in the registry. A Government which displays such incompetence in running the Land Registry system has no competence whatever to manage the affairs of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned about the record backlog of more than 80,000 applications in the Land Registry at the end of 1999. The blame for this backlog rests squarely on the shoulders of the Government because it has failed abysmally to provide adequate staff to deal with the increased volume of work with which the existing staff must cope. I am most concerned about the Government's plans to move the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds from Government responsibility and convert them to commercial semi-State status. I am vehemently opposed to the privatisation of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In life, the biggest single investment a family will make is their home. When a person obtains the title documents showing that he or she is registered as the owner in the Land Registry, he or she can be 100% satisfied that the title is guaranteed by the State and the Government. Therefore, the State guarantees that the title is 100% correct. The move to commercial semi-<Col N="897" /> State status regarding a person's title documents is a question of national importance. There is a constitutional guarantee on property rights in Ireland. If a semi-State body takes over control, it will be motivated by the sole purpose of profit.</P>
    <P>The new State body would have a monopoly over the registration of title for the future. This monopoly would be the sole party which will lay out rules and regulations regarding how an individual can go about registering his title documents. The Minister is likely to say the Government will impose sufficient controls. However, he is abrogating his responsibilities by transferring responsibility for the title documents of citizens to a semi-State monopoly. It will be the highest bidder in the offer for the control of the registration of a citizen's title. The focus of this semi-State body will be on profit as distinct from ensuring the guarantee of title that exists at present.</P>
    <P>The Government has increased the fees by 100% not for the benefit of the people who are currently waiting to have their title registered, but in the context of selling off the Land Registry to a commercial semi-State body which, from then on, will have monopolistic control over title registration in Ireland. I am totally opposed to such a move. Even at this stage, I ask the Government to re-examine this matter and drop its decision to sell off to the highest bidder the fundamental right of the people to have their title registered and backed by the elected Government.</P>
    <P>In some instances, the Minister and the Minister for Finance have doubled Land Registry fees. A property costing £40,001 will attract a Land Registry fee of £300 together with a further fee of £50 if a new folio is opened and another fee of £100 if there is a mortgage. Most people are finding it difficult to acquire a site in a large town for £40,000 with the result that almost all purchasers will fall into the new category of fees. As a former practising solicitor, the Minister will be aware that a voluntary transfer previously cost £30. Due to the Minister's approach, this will now be increased to more than £70.</P>
    <P>If there is a voluntary transfer concerning part of a folio, which is common, a further fee of £50 will be charged for opening the new folio, bringing the total fee to £120 which is four times the previous fee. If a person obtains a mortgage on a house, there will be an additional fee of £100. As Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, the Land Registry is paying its way at present and made a profit of £3,222,000. The Registry of Deeds is also showing a profit. Why is the Minister again putting his hands into the pockets of the people, looking for more money and attempting to further penalise house purchasers?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff of the Land Registry with whom I have dealt for more than 35 years, for their courtesy, hard work and dedication to their duties in very difficult conditions. Most people are having great difficulty buying houses at present and many are finding it impossible. <Col N="898" /> Why is the Minister and the Minister for Finance making what is difficult at present almost impossible? They have decided to impose a further charge on hard pressed house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Minister possesses a great deal of common sense and I urge him to withdraw these fees as the Land Registry is already making sufficient money. The Minister should not, under any circumstances, sell off the Land Registry at a profit and allow another organisation to take control of the title affairs of Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises that the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to approve a review in the fees charged by the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds is a necessary and fully justifiable step in the context of the preparation of the registries for conversion to commercial semi-State status; and furthermore, it commends the measures taken by the Minister in order to address the current arrears in the registries which have arisen largely due to the greatly increased volume of work brought about by the buoyant property market in recent years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I intend to begin by setting out the background to and the history of the current situation in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. The Government, in September 1990, gave its approval in principle for the reconstitution of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to this but he actually pre-dates the decision. This decision was warmly welcomed by the Law Society which had already proposed such a change.</P>
      <P>Arising from this decision, a small working group was established in order to advise my predecessor on the problems facing the registries at that time as well as on the steps required to give effect to the reconstitution. The problems referred to included a growing level of arrears which, in the early 1990s, had begun to give cause for concern. These arrears had arisen due to a number of factors including a reduction in the number of staff caused by the transfer and non-replacement of staff to other Departments. For example, between 1983 and 1990, staffing levels fell by 18% while the intake of work had grown by 10%. The Opposition parties were, of course, in Government for the greater part of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working group in May 1991 involved a number of recommendations including the immediate recruitment of staff to address the arrears, information technology and financial control initiatives, a review of the fees charged by the registries and the establishment of an interim board and the appointment of a chief executive <Col N="899" /> designate to advise on and oversee the conversion to semi-State status.</P>
    <P>The working group also recommended that the new semi-State body should have a commercial orientation. Following receipt of the report of the working group, steps were taken to implement its recommendations. New fees orders were introduced in 1991. The interim board and chief executive designate were appointed in 1992. A financial controller was appointed in 1994 and an IT programme was also launched during the same period.</P>
    <P>The arrears situation which had arisen in the registries was, under the guidance of the board and management, substantially addressed by a number of initiatives. These included improved work practices, enhanced training and development programmes and strategic planning in line with the SMI programme.</P>
    <P>The other major development in recent times affecting the registries was the enlightened decision of the then Fianna Fáil-led Administration to transfer a substantial body of staff and work to Waterford. As the House will be aware, this transfer has taken place and my information is that it has already contributed substantially to the area in the short period it has been in place. The other development of note is that the registries are currently seeking a building in Dublin which as well as consolidating the Dublin-based functions of the office will also serve as corporate headquarters for the entire organisation.</P>
    <P>At around the same time as the move to Waterford was being completed, a major increase occurred in the amount of work being received by the registries. This was as a direct result of the boom in property sales and the greatly increased volume of dealings generated in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. This has continued and, indeed, has intensified to the present day. The board and management of the registries have continued preparations for conversion to semi-State status, although little real progress was achieved until the current Government decided, in December 1998, to press ahead with the change. This is fully in keeping with the Government's policy of regulatory reform and will, in due course, result in a much more efficient and customer-oriented service for all users of the registries' services.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of key points as they relate to the efficient administration of the registries. In order to tackle the growing problem of arrears I have, following discussions with the Minister for Finance, arranged for the assignment of over 60 additional staff to the registries. This is the first real increase in the staffing resources of the registries since 1990. On foot of the Department of Finance sanction received, the Land Registry has requested the Civil Service Commission for the assignment of 45 additional staff. These comprise 24 executive officers, of which 18 are to be assigned to Dublin and six to Waterford, and 21 Clerical Officers, 18 of whom are to be assigned to Dublin and three to Water<Col N="900" /> ford. Additional staff to the above are to be assigned to both offices but the final numbers and grades are yet to determined. These assignments will be dealt with as quickly as possible by my Department. Arrangements are being made to fill some of the other posts sanctioned internally. These staff will be dedicated to reducing the arrears on hands. Special training programmes have been arranged in order to optimise the benefit of these staff to the registries.</P>
    <P>Other measures have also been implemented in order to improve the quality of the services being provided by the registries. Deputies have referred to a curtailment in the telephone services at the Land Registry. What is being referred to here are steps taken to curtail telephone inquiries to the Land Registry at certain times in order that staff would be free to handle dealings. I understand that this measure, which was discussed with the Law Society prior to its implementation, has been put in place until the end of this month and that it will then fall to be reviewed. I should add that the application of this limited restriction has had the desired effect with an improvement in the level of service and that this has actually been acknowledged by members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the decision some years ago to pursue a modern service utilising the best available information technology resources. The Land Registry has, over the past number of years, made great strides and invested significantly in introducing new information technology in order to improve the service it provides to its customers and, indeed, to better assist its own staff in delivering that service. The new computer system developed by Electronic Data Systems Ireland Limited, which was launched last year, is the culmination of considerable planning and implementation work.</P>
    <P>ITRIS, Integrated Title Registration Information System, is a state of the art computer system and it will, when fully implemented, deliver substantial benefits to the Land Registry, its staff and customers. These include improving customer service by reducing the time taken to process cases, providing more readily available information and support for staff involved in delivering Land Registry services, preserving and safeguarding the register itself, supporting improved communication between the organization and its customers and providing Land Registry management with better statistical information. The ITRIS system is due to become operational across the entire Land Registry in the next two to three years. This will involve a further investment of more than £2 million which, considering the importance of the registries to the continuing development of the economy, will be money well spent. Only a fraction of the registries' folios are yet in electronic format but plans are being developed to ensure that the remainder of these paper documents are computerised as quickly as possible. I understand that there are about 1.2 million of these documents and that this <Col N="901" /> conversion work will require a significant investment.</P>
    <P>We are now living in the information age and I note that this new system has a feature which enables customers to access certain Land Registry records over the lnternet. This will be invaluable to many legal practitioners and other clients because it will allow them to conduct business from their own offices that would previously have required a visit to the Land Registry. Of course, on-line access to Land Registry records was one of the flagship projects identified in the Information Society Group's electronic Government action plan and, indeed, the new Land Registry external access service is one of the first of these projects to come to fruition. Already, more than 1,200 major Land Registry clients are availing of this service and it will be extended to all counties in the next few years. These positive and innovative developments are very much at variance with the negative image being portrayed of the registries and their services in some quarters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of arrears of dealings and unnecessary delays, I wish to draw a few important points to the attention of the House. Registration of ownership of land with the Land Registry is an essential element in conveyancing and the State guarantee of title, to which Deputy Enright referred, is the cornerstone of the system.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have one of the most sophisticated systems of property registration, which is recognised as such internationally. Delays in completing dealings or furnishing maps, and so on, do not have the same implications today as they may have had, say, ten or 15 years ago. The deregulation of the financial sector has brought about a great reduction in the need for bridging finance which was much more commonplace some years ago. As a knock-on effect of this, there is no longer the real pressure for the completion of dealings and registrations.</P>

      <P>The critical services that customers of the registries require in a timely fashion are in the areas of inspection of folios and maps, certified copies services and first registration of schemes for developers. These areas have been identified as priorities and an efficient service is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for registration of title do not suffer as a result of the arrears of dealings. In any case where, an application must be processed speedily for genuine reasons, there are special arrangements in place to ensure this is achieved. The <Col N="902" /> Land Registry will not be found wanting in cases where a completion is genuinely required as a matter of urgency. Notwithstanding that, I fully accept that all of the registries' services should be delivered in an expeditious manner and, as I have already explained, the necessary measures to achieve this are being put in place.</P>
    <P>As regards the review of the scale of fees charged by the registries for their services, much of the comment has seriously misrepresented the position and I wish to put the record straight. I have approved two new fees orders, one for the Land Registry and the other for the Registry of Deeds. The Registry of Deeds Fees Order took effect from 1 February last and the Land Registry Fees Order will take effect from 1 May next. The orders give effect to a comprehensive review of the structure of the fees charged for the various services provided by the registries.</P>
    <P>They have been designed to provide a fair and balanced response to the changes that have taken place in the conveyancing and property markets since the previous orders were introduced in 1991 and before that in 1983. Specifically, there are a number of reasons for their introduction at this time. It is nine years since the orders were last revised and account needs to be taken of inflation and developments in the property market during that time. We also need to establish a realistic revenue base for the new commercial semi-State company and there is a requirement to simplify further the existing fees structure. The new fees structure is an essential element of the preparations for the conversion to commercial semi-State status and is also intended to simplify the fee structure for users of the registries' services and reduce the instance of inequities in the old system. They reflect the registries' objective of being responsive to the marketplace. One example of this is the introduction of a flat rate for the registration of mortgages. Uniquely within the conveyancing chain, the registries operate on a fixed fee rather than a percentage basis. The new fee orders continue this approach. I take this opportunity to outline some of the features of the new fees structure contained in the orders.</P>
    <P>While the overall rate of increase varies, the cost of the most common dealing, the registration of a transfer of property valued at between £40,001 and £200,000, has been increased from £250 to £300, a 20% rise which is not unreasonable given the period of time since the last review in 1991 and the rate of inflation during the same period which was 19.5%. There is a fixed fee for each transaction in the new fees order. This has eliminated the more arbitrary nature of the present dealings based fees order. In the small number of cases where errors occur with registrations, the ensuing compensation payments to the Registry clients are linked to the value of the property registered. For example, a property with a value of £1 million would generate a much greater compensation payment were an error to be made in the registration of the title than a property with a value of £100,000. Yet the fee to <Col N="903" /> the Registry for both transactions is currently the same, £250.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an example of the inequity referred to earlier and the new fees order is structured to reduce such inequities while operating within reasonable parameters in relation to the maximum fees payable. In some instances fees are being reduced, for example, a flat fee of £100 is being introduced for the registration of &ldquo;charges&rdquo; as opposed to the situation previously where the fees were based on the amount of the mortgage. Fees for transfers are also being reduced. A transfer of £40,000 will now cost £200. This constitutes a reduction of £50.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable change in the marketplace in recent years regarding property transactions and its financing. The new fees orders are responsive to such changes. With regard to mortgages, for example, it is now normal for people to switch mortgages or take out second mortgages due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Until now, charges or mortgages were liable to a fee up to £250. Now there will be a flat rate fee of £100 for registering charges. This will be a significant saving for many people and should prove to be a popular and progressive change.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry currently offers a free service to builders and solicitors where a scheme or a multi-storey development is being carried out. This service is extremely time-consuming and the proposed new fee will not compensate for the time involved. However, it goes some way to recognising the amount of resources required in the Registry to service such dealings. Typically a scheme map would contain anything from ten to 50 plus sites and it is estimated that the average cost per site will be from £1 to £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Items 24 and 25 of the Land Registry Fees Order are intended to address the situation that has arisen in the Registry where a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources is being taken up in dealing with what are, in essence, applications that have been submitted with incorrect or incomplete documents and or fees. These measures have attracted some criticism and there may be some confusion here. Item 24 is not a &ldquo;penalty charge&rdquo; but rather an administration charge which is necessary to defray some of the costs incurred by the Land Registry in dealing with an application up to the stage of refusal, abandonment, etc. Considerable time is spent on these cases which are ultimately refused, abandoned or withdrawn. At present a fee is not charged for such applications. The new charge is merely a small fee towards the significant costs in terms of staff resources arising for the Land Registry in these cases. It may be that there is some misunderstanding. This is not a charge for rejected dealings of which there were about 18,000 last year. A charge is not made for rejected cases. It is a charge for a specific category of case, <Col N="904" /> that is, those formally refused, withdrawn or abandoned.</P>
    <P>Items 25 deals with excess fees. This occurs where the incorrect fee is submitted with the application. There is no reason for this to happen in practice as the registries have a long standing policy of informing the legal profession through the various channels regarding the fees applicable for the different transactions. The refund of these excess fees is a hugely time consuming process for Land Registry staff and the charge being introduced is not a penalty but an administration charge to cover only some of the costs involved in administering the system. The registries process upwards of 12,000 excess fee refunds per year amounting to approximately £800,000.</P>
    <P>In the Registry of Deeds, general increases in line with inflation have been implemented, the main charge for the registration of a memorial being increased from £26 to £35. The daily search fee of £10 per day has been eliminated and has been replaced by a £1 search fee per name, per 10 year period. This will reflect the usage of the service. It has been alleged that the revised fees will place an additional heavy burden on those persons who are already struggling to pay for their homes. These suggestions are without foundation and can only serve to add to the problems being experienced by those who are severely stretched by the current market in trying to purchase a home. This contention does not bear scrutiny. Any reasonable examination of the facts will reveal that the actual effect of the revised fees order on the cost of the typical property will be negligible in comparison with the costs associated with the actual purchase and various other costs involved. I wonder how many of those practitioners in the conveyancing and associated fields have not increased their fees since 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, states that &ldquo;The fees shall, so far as possible be fixed, so as to produce an annual amount sufficient to discharge the salaries, remuneration and other expenses payable under, and incidental to, the working of this Act&rdquo;. While the case may be made that the annual fees income, as currently structured, may exceed the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds Votes, this does not reflect the full costs involved in providing the services. These include the provision for pensions, accommodation and other costs in central administration which are met by my Department. Were all of these elements to be factored in, the picture would be different.</P>
    <P>The decision to transfer the Land Registries to commercial semi-State status has been welcomed by all the interests involved in conveyancing, including the Law Society. The change cannot be accomplished overnight. To place the new company on a sound commercial footing, it is necessary to put the proper structures in place. The staff and management must be given the necessary tools to enable them to operate in a commercial environment, providing a standard and level of service which is commensurate with the com<Col N="905" /> mercial world. Most importantly, the level of fees charged for the various services provided must reflect the cost of providing the service and it must also provide a viable economic environment within which the company can operate, pay its staff, provide for their pensions and invest in the future enhancement and development of its services.</P>
    <P>To this end, as part of the preparations for semi-State status, a detailed report was commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess the financial viability of the proposed new body. The report confirmed the viability of the Land Registries as a commercial semi-State body but made the point that this could not be achieved on the basis of the current fees which were last reviewed in 1991. Like any business, it is just not possible to continue to accommodate steadily increasing expenditure on the one hand and freeze the income on the other. This review of the fees, therefore, is an essential component in the process of conversion to semi-State status and to suggest that it can be continually postponed is at best unrealistic and at worst undermines the whole basis for conversion to semi-State status.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the Land Registry office in Waterford. As I indicated earlier, this significant decentralisation decision was taken by a Fianna Fáil led administration. We gave expression to our policy of decentralisation and regionalisation by taking decisions to move significant blocks of work and staff out of Dublin. That, of course, is in marked contrast to the lip service paid to this ideal by those in Opposition. Worse than that, some of those on the benches opposite have in recent weeks put it about in the Waterford area that the office there is about to be downgraded as part of some grand plan being hatched by the Government. This is fanciful thinking which owes its origins to political mischief making.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan asked about compulsory registration and said registration with the Land Registry is compulsory only in three counties. There is an increasing demand for Land Registry services and any extension of compulsory registration would have significant and immediate implications for the operation of the Land Registry, particularly regarding its ability to maintain the current level of service. Deputy Flanagan also referred to the difficulty which some midland counties are experiencing regarding the stamping of deeds. It is true there is an office for stamping in Dublin and Cork and none in Waterford. I will raise this matter with the Minister for Finance to see if something can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan will be aware that stamp duty is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners which <Col N="907" /> is why we must deal with them. Regarding the allegations of a shortage of legal and mapping staff, I wish to make it clear there is no shortage of mapping staff. Since decentralisation to Waterford, the Land Registry has up to 32 additional supernumerary mapping staff. Mapping work has been maintained and kept up-to-date. There is no shortage of legal staff and service has been maintained at a constant level. However, due to the complexity of the examination of title cases, which represent about 2% of the intake of applications for registration, there are delays in resolving title queries with solicitors. We will ensure an increase in staff at administrative and clerical level.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that by the middle or end of this year, output will have begun to match input which everybody will welcome. The new IT which is being put in place will assist in dealing with the backlog of cases. Deputies on all sides of the House should be certain that it gives me no pleasure to see a backlog. Regarding the future of the Land Registry, a semi-State body is being proposed, the shareholders of which will be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance. I assure Deputy Enright that there are no proposals to privatise the Land Registries. The proposed legislation will reflect the sentiments I have expressed.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa diospóireacht tábhachtach seo go bhfuil baint faoi leith aige leis an Dáil ceantair as a dtagaim. The lecture just given by the Minister on the Land Registry office in Waterford highlights contradictions in two statements he made yesterday and today. Yesterday, I tabled Questions Nos. 507, 548 and 550 to the Minister relating to the creation of new posts at the Waterford Land Registry office. In his reply the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I can confirm that 12 of the additional posts have already been identified for assignment to Waterford. These comprise six executive officer and six clerical officer posts.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister said today that, on foot of receiving sanction from the Department of Finance, the Land Registry has requested the Civil Service Commission to appoint 45 additional staff &ndash; 24 executive officers, of whom 18 are to be assigned to Dublin and six to Waterford, and 21 clerical officers, of whom 18 are to be assigned to Dublin and three to Waterford. The Minister might explain where the other three clerical officers disappeared to since yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about taking part in this important debate. I am my party's spokesperson on Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and I have been pursuing the ongoing difficulties with archaeological monitoring at Dúchas, the State heritage agency. Dúchas placed a two month embargo on the issuing of archaeological licences in the middle of January but long delays are still expected until the problem of staff shortages is addressed. The Construction Indus<Col N="908" /> try Federation has pointed out that delays in securing licences for archaeological projects from Dúchas is causing considerable difficulty for developers and might add to the problems of implementing the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of the Land Registry, Ms Catherine Dalton, described the Land Registry last January as being in a difficult position. She said it would be stretched by the development plan and public opening hours would probably have to be reduced at the Waterford office in the future. She made these comments at a time when the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had sanctioned a request for extra staff and the request was forwarded to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Director General of the Law Society, Mr. Ken Murphy, was reported at the same time as having stated that the backlog at the Land Registry was causing a great deal of frustration and annoyance. He said that people attempting to sell houses or land frequently experienced long delays in obtaining legal titles and many found it difficult to obtain top-up loans because of mounting arrears. He also pointed out that many new householders might still not be the legal owners of the property months after they purchased their dwellings. The average time to process a dealing had by then risen from approximately four weeks to seven months in some counties.</P>
    <P>Delays cost money. The Minister, however, has approved two fees orders, one for the Registry of Deeds and one for the Land Registry. Against a background of rapid increases in the cost of family homes, he and the Minister for Finance jointly decided to increase fees. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, told the House on Tuesday, 7 March that it was his sincere wish to put the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds on a proper commercial footing as a semi-State agency by the end of the year 2001. This follows a Government decision of December 1998 to proceed with the conversion to a commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of the Land Registry said in January that the intake of dealings had increased by 47% since 1993 but there had been no increase in staff. She went on to state that this problem had been compounded by the introduction of decentralisation in 1997 which had resulted in the loss of 22% of experienced staff who did not wish to move to Waterford. The Director General of the Law Society was quoted as saying that the backlog at the Land Registry was a national embarrassment. Figures from the Land Registry in January showed arrears of 85,353 dealings, representing an increase of 65% over 1998. One of the Minister's responses was to increase fees.</P>
    <P>The draft Bill to give effect to the conversion of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds to a commercial semi-State body has been circulated to Departments for observations. The Minister said these observations are now being assessed and that it is his intention to submit the draft Bill to the Government in the near future. The Mini<Col N="909" /> ster has presided over the Land Registry for almost three years. His inaction has been the major contributing factor in the near disastrous situation that now exists.</P>
    <P>On 7 March he announced the extra 45 posts, 24 at executive officer level and 21 at clerical officer level. I left the House last night believing that six executive officers and six clerical officers were going to Waterford. I have discovered otherwise from the Minister this evening. Perhaps he or Deputy Kenneally will explain the discrepancy.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint new staff, delayed beyond the point of near disaster, is nonetheless welcome. Better late than never. The chief executive and registrar of titles has informed the Minister that arrangements are being made through the Office of Public Works for the acquisition of a site for a new building for the Land Registry. This building is to replace the existing headquarters and to house the geographic work areas currently sited in several different locations in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to the motion is mind boggling. During the Minister's period in office, when the Land Registry progressively needed more staff, he took no effective action. Since the Government decision of December 1998 to proceed with the conversion of the Land Registry to a commercial semi-State body, he has failed to appoint anybody from Waterford to the interim board. The office in Waterford is a constituent office of the Land Registry and deals with all aspects of registration for Counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation of part of the Land Registry to Waterford was undertaken in a manner which took account of the demand to provide registration services locally. Decision making in relation to the registration of property was devolved to the office in Waterford. It caters for ten of the Twenty-Six Counties yet, following the decision on conversion, the Minister saw no reason to appoint a Waterford based person to the interim board even though Cork, Mayo and predominantly Dublin are represented.</P>
    <P>The interim board of the Land Registry operates on a non-statutory basis. It has no formal terms of reference but its principal role is to advise the Minister on the various steps required to prepare the registry for commercial semi-State status. The advice has primarily related to the legislation required for the conversion as well as financial and personnel related matters.</P>
    <P>The decision in principle was taken by the Government in December 1998.He looked at the interim board and realised that Waterford was catering for ten counties, yet he did not see fit to have representation from Waterford on the board. This is indicative of the attitude of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party to Waterford &ndash; it does not matter, nor does it matter if anybody from Waterford is on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> In a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday the Minister said he recently received Department of Finance sanction for the recruitment of five additional assistant principal posts and ten additional higher executive officer posts above the existing authorised number. He did not indicate the existing authorised number for each post, nor did he state the number of new posts to be created or filled in Waterford. He indicated that the level of these posts in both Waterford and Dublin is the subject of ongoing discussions with the staff representative unions concerned. I call on the Minister to address the issue of the number of additional posts at principal officer level and above, which are to be created. How many will be created in Waterford?</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minster also indicated that he has no plans to decentralise the headquarters of the Land Registry. I have no difficulty in supporting the motion as far as the words &ldquo;and further calls on the Minister to decentralise the Land Registry.&rdquo;. It calls for this &ldquo;so that applications from surrounding catchment counties will henceforth be dealt with by established Land Registry offices in the regions.&rdquo;. On 7 March Deputy Jim Higgins suggested decentralising the Land Registry so that Land Registry offices strategically positioned in the regions would be able to serve the surrounding catchment areas. He went on to ask the Minister if he did not agree that it would make sense to locate an office in the midlands, the west and the south-west in addition to the office in Waterford. As a Deputy representing Waterford I strongly take issue with this proposal. Deputy Flanagan went further when he suggested that the Leinster counties be removed from the remit of the Waterford office. Of the ten counties administered from Waterford, five are Leinster counties.</P>
    <P>Returning to Deputy Jim Higgins's proposal, the south-west counties Cork and Kerry and the midlands counties Laois and Offaly are dealt with from Waterford. The net effect of his proposal would be to weaken decentralisation that has already taken place in Waterford to the benefit of areas that have already gained handsomely through decentralisation. The criticisms made by Deputy Flanagan of the office in Waterford &ndash; I will not accept any criticism of the excellent staff there who are working in very difficult circumstances &ndash; appear to be based on the Minister's inaction in that he has not provided sufficient staff nor a stamping facility. As a solicitor and member of the Law Society, Deputy Flanagan's criticisms that the staff in Waterford has not received sufficient training must be listened to.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's programme of decentralisation a further 10,000 Civil Service positions are to leave Dublin. Common sense dictates that instead of fragmenting the Land Registry it should be decentralised in its entirety to Waterford. The office located there which, by the Minster's description, is a constituent office of the Land Registry is effectively being downgraded by the recent proposals for additional staff. I take <Col N="911" /> issue with the Minister on this point. Waterford does not have an office manager, although it now appears such a position may be created. Apart from that it is clear that the vast majority of the new senior positions are for Dublin and I challenge the Minister to deny it.</P>
    <P>This development is all the more serious against the background of the conversion of the Land Registry to semi-State status. If it is the Minister's intention to have the Land Registry up and running as a semi-State body by the end of next year, this looks like the last tranche of additional staff it will get. The logic of the Minister's position escapes me. If the senior staff members are to be allocated mainly to Dublin that will result in the effective downgrading of Waterford in comparative terms. There is no argument against that.</P>
    <P>With 386.5 staff in Dublin and 151 in Waterford there is a built-in majority in favour of Dublin. The head office function is in Dublin. The career path in the Waterford office is and will remain constricted because the top promotional posts will be in Dublin and not Waterford, including the posts of registrar, deputy registrar, manager, financial controller, IT manager, senior assistant registrar, junior assistant registrar, assistant manager, AP senior systems analysts and HEO systems analysts.</P>
    <P>The only way to ensure the future of the Land Registry in Waterford is to decentralise it in total, including the head office, to Waterford. There is not an insurmountable obstacle to doing this. All that is needed is the political will. It is not the Waterford office of the Land Registry that has reduced to just one hour per day, the time in which it accepts telephone calls from the public.</P>
    <P>Why must the proposed new Land Registry building be located in Dublin? I take it that funding is being put in place to finance it through the additional charges. Will the Minister be more clear than in his reply to my parliamentary question yesterday? What stage is the Office of Public Works at in terms of acquiring the new site in Dublin? Can he indicate if a price has been agreed and has a deal been concluded? At what stage is planning permission for the new building if a site has been identified, or is it only at the stage where the Office of Public Works is looking at the market to see if a site can be secured? I am concerned that many years may pass before there is a new building. It does not have to be in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I was a Minister of State when decentralisation was put in place. The decentralisation of the Land Registry took place just after the Government of which I was a member went out of office. The Minister should not try that one. I will not accept any allegation of mischief making or of spreading rumours. It is an incontrovertible fact that the office in Waterford is being downgraded in that the vast majority of the senior positions are going to Dublin. I am sure the Minister will agree that, if and when the semi-State board is set up and is given the instruction and mandate to operate on a commercial basis, decisions can be taken at that time. With the inbuilt staff majority I have already described to him, the position of Waterford is vulnerable.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister could give me some clarification about higher executive officer and assistant principal officer posts which are to be filled in the Land Registry. How many people in Waterford are eligible for those posts? How many of those posts will be filled in Waterford? The Minister knows as well as I do that the vast majority of the posts will go to Dublin. The Minister should not indulge in lectures about scaremongering. The situation in Waterford is now being copperfastened against the prospect of a semi-State body being in place next year. Is it likely that the semi-State body will decide to decentralise any of its head office or decision-making functions to Waterford? The Minister said that the Waterford office is a constituent office of the Land Registry. Is there any decision-making process in Waterford in terms of the overall administration of the Land Registry? The Minister knows as well as I do that there is not. I appeal to him to support the decentralisation of the Land Registry to Waterford. Let us forget all the Minister said about history. The buck stops with him. Is he prepared to take on board my proposal that the entire Land Registry should be decentralised to Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Some of the points which arose during the debate were interesting. Obviously, we cannot comment on the legislation until it is published and we are in a position to examine it. The argument about whether the semi-State body is the way forward is not something on which the book is closed but is something which we must continue to examine to see what is best in the context of Waterford.</P>
    <P>I will not support the Fine Gael motion. I have no problem with the earlier parts of it, but to support the latter part would be to support a position which would be detrimental to my constituency. The Government amendment is a general absolution for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has presided over the Land Registry, the backlog in which has been described as a national embarrassment and where there have been huge increases in delays in dealing with applications. There is no getting away from the fact that he has presided over that. The Minister would say that there has been a huge increase in conveyancing and the number of transactions. While that is the case, surely it did not happen without the Government's knowledge. The Government commissioned the two Bacon reports and is reputedly examining the area of housing. Yet, the insinuation or suggestion seems to be that this situation crept up on the Government and that it did not have sufficient time to deal with it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition, he was the merciless scourge of the Government. Whatever went wrong or whatever breakdown occurred in terms of policing, prisons or the administration of justice, he was a fine, merciless scourge. He said that there was no way these things should happen and that there had to be accountability.</P>

      <P>I wish the Opposition would debate items of greater importance than this one. The Minister has already decided to improve the services of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. I cannot reconcile the Opposition's criticism of the Minister's initiative at the same time as it demands that steps are taken to improve the service.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea spoke about locating the new offices of the Land Registry in Waterford. I stake my claim as well and suggest to the Minister and the Minister of State that, were a part of the Land Registry to be relocated, they should consider the picturesque village of Blarney in County Cork, in the constituency of Cork North-Central. There is currently a site available for that office and I will write to the Minister to ask him to consider this proposal. I thank Deputy O'Shea for the suggestion.</P>

      <P>I agree with the statistics the Opposition has quoted in relation to the record <Col N="915" /> backlog of over 80,000 applications pending. I fully support the view that the unnecessary delays endured by purchasers of new homes and sites need to be tackled. The Minister has taken steps to provide a solution to the Opposition's dilemma. Why does it now criticise the Minister for doing what it requested him to do? The logic behind this motion escapes me. The necessary legislation is currently being put in place to convert the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to a semi-State commercial body. Change had to be made.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the number of property transactions dealt with at the Land Registry was over 91,000. This mushroomed to over 130,000 applications, dealt with by approximately the same number of staff, in 1999. The vast explosion in demand for service has resulted in arrears of over 86,000 applications carried forward into this millennium. Change has resulted in a 35% increase in turnover at the registry. The Minister made a case to the Department of Finance for the recruitment of a substantial number of additional staff for the Land Registry and sanction has been given to increase staffing in the office to 77 people.</P>
      <P>The service to customers in the greater Dublin area is computerised. Only a limited number of folios in the western region have been computerised to date and that is the main reason for the different levels of service currently enjoyed in both regions. The wider implications of the new title, registration information system, in conjunction with the employment of additional staff will alleviate the backlog in the western region.</P>
      <P>I note the points the Opposition has made on increased fees. As we are all aware, no increase in fees took place since 1991. The increase in fee structure is proportionate to the rate of inflation since 1991. Under its new semi-State format the service must operate on a sound commercial basis. A view has been aired that major increases are taking place, but that is not the case. Fees are reduced for certain transactions and are to be reduced for the registration of charges and transfers. There is a fixed fee per transaction under the new fees system. It is structured so that inequities that have been complained about are removed. The general level of increase for the services of the Registry of Deeds is in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Opposition to support the Minister in the transition of this body into a commercially sound semi-State body which will deliver the service required in this millennium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">

      <P>The motion before us is almost a continuation of the weekly whinge we hear from the Opposition about issues which, though they may have to be debated, are not among the more important ones. This motion is almost a contradiction. While the Opposition asks for increased facilities and greater efficiency, it is not willing to accept the charges that sometimes come with such efficiencies. It is historic that there is such a backlog in the Land Registry. <Col N="916" /> There has been a problem in this area for as long as I can remember.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be commended once again on his pro-active approach by increasing the number of staff to 77 to deal with the problem. That will surely result in greater efficiency in the Land Registry and eliminate the 80,000 applications outstanding. Given that the economy is moving at such a rapid pace and there are so many applications before the Land Registry, it is reasonable to accept that there would be a backlog. However, I do not accept that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is to blame for the inefficiency of previous years. That did not happen yesterday or today, but since Fianna Fáil took office the Minister has dealt with the problem.</P>
      <P>Opposition Members cannot have their cake and eat it. There must be some increase in fees. There must be some change, and the changes put forward by the Minister are reasonable and will deal with the problem. I hope that in this area, as in many other areas of Government, we will see a greater move towards the use of information technology so that the consumer can deal with this problem on the Internet and there is no need for the queues and backlogs that currently exist.</P>
      <P>The sooner we reach the point where we have &ldquo;e-Government&rdquo;, where people can transact their business without coming to the office, the better will be the position for us all. It will lead to greater efficiency and greater value for money in terms of the spend in the Department.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the steps he has taken in this regard which will lead to greater efficiency. Opposition members should support him rather than sit on their hands whingeing.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Fine Gael and Labour parties are late converts to the idea of decentralisation because, as you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Fine Gael and Labour, when in Government, prevented the programme of decentralisation in the early 1980s. Fortunately in the meantime Fianna Fáil, in successive Governments, has implemented a successful decentralisation programme, and Waterford and the Land Registry are some of the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Given that so many bids have been made tonight in regard to further decentralisation of the Land Registry, there will probably be none of the registry left to be transferred to Cavan or Monaghan. I would gladly and willingly accept decentralisation of any other section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to County Cavan. If it is practical, we would be delighted to have the new Courts Service or the new Prisons Service in the county. As there is already an institution in Loughan House in Blacklion, the headquarters and entire body of the new Prisons Service would be a welcome addition to the Cavan area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us, as public representatives, experience frustration and delays in dealing with transactions <Col N="917" /> in the Land Registry, but in making representations over the years I have always received the utmost help from the officials in the registry who go out of their way to process, as rapidly as possible, titles that need to be provided urgently. We all experience frustration, particularly people with local authority houses where the title to the property is not easily found. Unfortunately, delays are experienced in constructing local authority houses due to the lack of proper title going back some generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quite cogently outlined the effective measures he has implemented and is implementing to effectively tackle the backlog. He quite rightly introduced the review of fees and the new fees structure represents a balanced system in terms of the revenue that needs to be generated. When Fianna Fáil was in Government in September 1990 it established the Land Registry as a semi-State body. That decision was welcomed by the various interests involved. It is important that that body is able to operate on a sound commercial footing. The fees, new structures and new technology must be put in place to ensure that the new body operates effectively and in a way that it can generate revenue for further investment, leading to greater efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Registry is one of the agencies of the State which does a significant amount of work, usually behind closed doors and unnoticed. It is only when there is a backlog we realise its importance in both historical and economic terms. I have had many dealings with the Land Registry in recent years. I commend the officers with whom I dealt for their professionalism and courtesy and for the level of information they make available. I am surprised the tone of this debate suggests that the Land Registry is a difficult arm of the State with which to deal because that has not been my experience.</P>
      <P>I understand this is the first fee increase since 1991. The figures I have seen do not seem excessive. I welcome the considerable investment in information technology infrastructure which is the way forward. I also welcome the fact it will be a commercial semi-State body in the not too distant future. There are good reasons to proceed that way. There have been dramatic changes in conveyancing and in the property market and the fees charged must be sufficient to enable the Land Registry to operate in this commercial environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of dealing with the Land Registry suggests that people are more concerned about speed and efficiency than costs. Delays are costly for some people. The current delays are due to historical factors and to the large increase in property transactions. Heretofore, the fees represented only a fraction of the cost of processing an application. An increase of £50 on the transfer of property valued at between £40,000 and £200,000 cannot be described as excessive. There must also be benefits from the core staff increase <Col N="918" /> of 77 which was necessary. The number of property transactions in 1993 was more than 90,000 and this increased to 133,000 in 1999.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the full computerisation of folios in the west which means that applications will be dealt with more speedily. The modest fees have been reduced in some cases, although that was not mentioned here this evening. The recommendations in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report must be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I must respond to the extraordinary remarks of my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Shea, earlier this evening. I was surprised at what he said because he is normally a responsible person. I was amazed at the way he appeared to undermine the way the Waterford office operates. I have spoken to a number of the staff in the Land Registry office in Waterford and they are angry at the way they are being portrayed and at the witch-hunt against them which is totally without foundation, as the Minister said on numerous occasions. A training programme was put in place for the staff in Waterford and it has been a success. The new staff are already performing to a high standard. A state of the art training and conference facility has also been provided there.</P>
      <P>It is rich to hear anyone in the Labour Party or in Fine Gael speak about decentralisation. They must have short memories because they scrapped the decentralisation programme when they were in Government a number of years ago. It is too much to see them crying crocodile tears about decentralisation.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that there is a discrepancy in the number of people transferring to Waterford. The Minister said he is increasing the number of staff from 150 to 162, not downgrading the office and reducing the numbers. There are six executive officers, three clerical officers and three other officers of grades to be determined.</P>

The Minister's actions have been to consolidate and to improve Waterford where possible. The staff in Waterford have performed exceptionally well and they have enhanced the city.</P>
      <P>I understand that of the 77 staff sanctioned 45 will be brought on stream immediately. I agree with Deputy O'Shea that more of the Land Registry office should be decentralised to Waterford as it would be good for the Land Registry and for the city. The south-east in general and Waterford city in particular have a lot to offer. Many of those who come to Waterford to work in a variety of capacities are reluctant to leave.</P>

      <Col N="919" /> I view this Opposition motion as an attempt to embarrass the Minister. It is unproductive and futile and does not suggest this is a serious parliamentary Opposition. I have no difficulty supporting the amendment tabled by the Minister. There is nothing worse in the public service or elsewhere than a lame duck underfunded body. That is what the Land Registry is destined to become if it is not given the realistic increases necessary. On too many occasions increases in public sector services have been deferred with the result that they begin to creak at the seams and they do not serve the people adequately. When the necessary steep fee increases are then introduced, they are seen as exorbitant. The Minister is bringing the Land Registry service into the 21st century. To deny him the mechanisms and funds necessary to do that is to deny the people an effective and essential part of our legal system.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry is a good and efficient service which can and will be improved through the appointment of necessary staff. To ensure a reasonably smooth transition to the commercial semi-State sector in the future, it is necessary to take action on resources now. To refuse or neglect to do that would be to sabotage a necessary service and to deprive the people of their rights. I support the amendment to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on the Land Registry office. I support the general thrust of the Minister's approach to establish the Land Registry office as a commercial semi-State body which is long overdue. It will lead to greater efficiencies in the Land Registry office when it has its own independent status and is in a position to charge a commercial rate for a commercial job and deliver a good commercial service to the public whom it serves.</P>
      <P>I deplore the motion because it seeks to defer the long overdue and necessary increases in the fees payable for Land Registry activities. I also oppose the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Shea who is against the establishment of regional offices in other areas of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister will introduce the property registration authority of Ireland Bill this year. I have asked him to deal in that legislation with one long-standing anomaly in relation to land registration, particularly in Counties Laois and Offaly which are in my constituency. I call on the Minister to ensure that Counties Laois and Offaly are put on the maps in the Land Registry office. There is a long-standing anomaly whereby the Land Registry official records refer to County Laois as Queen's County and to County Offaly as King's County. As recently as last Monday I received copies of documents from the Land Registry office which mentioned Queen's County and King's County. I understand there are historical reasons this was not changed before now. It is offensive to them that they are still labouring under this old terminology in County Laois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> The change must be implemented and I hope the Minister will make one exception in the legislation as regards commercial activity. Due to the sensitivity of the issue I have highlighted, I hope that people in Laois and Offaly who want folios for their houses transferred to Counties Laois and Offaly from Queen's County and King's County will not be charged, as we should not be asked to pay for putting our county names on our folios.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will consider locating a regional Land Registry office in County Laois to serve the midland region because of its central location. I congratulate the Minister on the progress made and fully support him on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no objection to a review of fees charged by the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. We are preparing the registries for commercial semi-State status and that is the right direction for the Minister to go. However, I am concerned at delays in dealing with title and registration applications in the Land Registry. One can see the effects of the property market, even in rural Ireland, where individual houses are built on family farms. The problem of land holdings, perhaps divided by the Land Commission, is relevant to County Galway and other western counties and successive Governments have not dealt effectively with the transfer of the Land Commission to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>There is also a difficulty regarding commonages which are not divided. On occasion it is difficult to obtain agreement on the shares in commonages. I made representations to the Land Registry on behalf of a young constituent regarding registration of a family farm site on which he wished to build a house. It transpired that this was a Land Commission holding and that his father was not even registered for the land. This was not the fault of the Land Registry but it is an indication of the serious situation which arises with former Land Commission holdings.</P>
      <P>Staff in the Land Registry are most helpful when dealing with difficult cases and I commend them for this approach. They should continue to give priority to people building a house, otherwise people will have to pay large amounts of bridging finance to financial institutions. I support the call to decentralise the Land Registry. Decentralisation has always been Fianna Fáil policy and I would welcome the relocation of a Department to east Galway. There should be no need for people in rural areas such as the west to have to obtain maps from the Land Registry in Dublin. This causes delays which result in further delays in the payment of EU pensions and extensification grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of extra staff for the Land Registry. Sanction has been given to increase the core number of staff by 77 which will improve the level of service for which the Minister should be congratulated. The new fees will have little effect on the cost of a <Col N="921" /> typical property in comparison with costs associated with the purchase of the property and other costs. Some fees, such as transfers, will be reduced and no one could justify a free service for builders and solicitors concerning a large scheme such as a multi-storey development. This is the first review of fees since 1991 and, in the circumstances, it is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating a motion which displays two sides of the Fine Gael Party. Deputy Jim Mitchell is the value for money guru yet Deputy Hayes has tabled a motion which eschews value for money. There has been no increase in Land Registry fees since 1991, yet there has been a vast increase in the value of properties transferred, sold and so on. The State has provided the service at a flat rate, despite the comments of some members of the Opposition. The fee was the same whether the property transferred was worth £100,000 or £1 million and no reasonable person would argue that this should be the case. There has also been a reduction in some of the fees charged with regard to the registration of charges and fees for transfers, but this has not been mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry has done a tremendous job for many years, particularly the Cork section based in Waterford, and I have nothing but praise for those working in that area. The amount of work carried out by the Land Registry has increased enormously over the past few years, a fact of which the Minister and the Government have been cognisant. The Minister has approved an additional 77 staff for the Land Registry and this is an important step, given the increased level of construction in the past few years.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his work in establishing the Land Registry as a semi-State body. This step has been spoken about for 15 years and the Minister has finally grasped the nettle to bring the Land Registry into the modern age.</P>

      <P>The Minister is increasing staff numbers in the Land Registry. He has also introduced a computer system and every effort is <Col N="922" /> being made to ensure that the registry keeps pace with the Celtic tiger. Some Deputies denigrated staff in the Land Registry yet did not mention that special arrangements can be made with solicitors in cases of hardship. Neither did they mention that 1,200 solicitors are now dealing via the Internet using the computer system which ensures an efficient response.</P>
      <P>In addition, no one mentioned that Kildare and Wicklow will be on the Internet by the middle of next year or that the Land Registry also hopes to add Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kerry to the Internet next year. This is progress and when the Land Registry becomes a commercial, State-sponsored body it will be willing and able to meet the demands of customers. We should recognise this fact and exhort everyone in the Land Registry. We should also thank them for the service they are delivering and ensure that the recruitment drive is completed on time so that the service will be of a standard we would all wish to see provided. The Minister is the one person who cannot be held responsible for this issue. No previous Minister tackled this issue to the same extent as Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>All credit is due to the staff who work in the Land Registry. They are a credit to the Civil Service, the jewel in the crown of the staff working for the State. The conditions in and pressure under which they work are a disgrace. There is a 16 month delay in processing applications at present. At the end of 1999, 90,000 applications were outstanding. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe should take note of that. The number of applications has doubled since the Government entered office but the Land Registry is still badly understaffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past eight years there has been a 44% increase in the number of transactions taking place but in that time not one additional staff member has been recruited to the Land Registry. The staff cannot cope at present with the demands being put on them by young couples who want to transfer a site to their name so they can secure a mortgage and build a house. This <Col N="923" /> puts immense pressure on building land in the State and causes development costs to rise.</P>
    <P>Queries from County Roscommon are only dealt with between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays and only then if someone remembers to switch off the answering machines. The official involved will then tell the caller that, although the file is in front of him, he does not have time to look at it for at least a fortnight. The staff simply cannot deal with the demands being placed on them.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, the Minister is now going to increase the charge by between £50 and £250 for a service which grows slower by the day. The Minister is completely out of touch with the current situation. He talks about increasing charges when the Land Registry made a profit of £3.5 million in 1998 and £5 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>This service should remain within the State sector and not be turned into a semi-State body. The documents belong to the people of the State and should not be given to a body which, if the Government continues along the same path, will be privatised. Privatisation would ensure that people will not have the same access to the papers and that there would be no accountability. The Minister could not tell Members of this House why applications are not being processed.</P>
    <P>I endorse the idea of decentralisation to regional offices. Roscommon would be an ideal location for such an office. We have to wait between eight and ten months for an application to be processed. Why should we have to go to Dublin to resolve dealings with the Land Registry?</P>
    <P>The old Land Commission is now part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is an utter disgrace that for the entire western seaboard there are only two staff to deal with queries which may go back 12 years because the old Land Commission never properly transferred deeds into the new land owners' names. The situation is unacceptable and causes further delays to the Land Registry. The Department should wake up and grant proper resources to the Land Commission. Its staff are trying to deal with outdated paper work which should have been completed years ago.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is an elderly woman in severe financial difficulty. She sold a site to a neighbour but cannot receive payment because the Land Commission did not transfer it into her husband's name. He had bought it from a neighbour who has since died. That has caused chaos for 18 months and will continue to do so for at least another six months. This adds to the delays which already exist but the Government does not have the competence to resolve the issue. It is time the Government woke up to the situation and granted proper resources to the Land Registry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on tabling this motion. The reason he did so is not simply to criticise the Govern<Col N="924" /> ment. We have to do our job as an Opposition. We are complaining because we are all inundated with complaints from solicitors and people waiting for months to complete their dealings with the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>The Government talks about waiting lists. There were two Ministers in the Department of Health and Children, the senior Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and there were 38,000 people on waiting lists. I compliment the Taoiseach on the good job he did in getting rid of the two of them. Now in housing there is another Minister with waiting lists, and I ask the Taoiseach to get rid of him. There is a Minister in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who faces a waiting list of 90,000 applications. The Taoiseach should get rid of him as well because that is the only answer.</P>
      <P>Now the Government has a new solution, a Fianna Fáil solution to a Fianna Fáil problem. Fianna Fáil has been in Government for 11 of the past 13 years. Fianna Fáil Ministers have created many problems in the Land Registry in the course of those 11 years. We cannot get rid of all the Ministers but we must get rid of some of them. This is a serious problem and something must be done to resolve it. As Deputy Naughten said, the pressure under which the staff in the Land Registry work is obvious to anyone who visits. It is not often that I have good things to say about Civil Service staff, but I compliment these people who work in such dangerous conditions. It is wrong that they have to work in an out of date building.</P>
      <P>The Department digitises its offices in Dublin and then in Cork. What about the west? We are left until last again. Why are we always left until last? Why were Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim not digitised first? Why are we treated as second class citizens?</P>
      <P>If a person went into a hotel and the room was dirty, and that person ordered breakfast for the next morning and it did not arrive for two years, the hotel would not be able to raise its fees. The Minister should not increase fees in the Land Registry if people have to wait as long as a constituent of mine. On 8 December 1999 the person sent an application to the Land Registry and received a reply on 14 March 2000, 99 days later, telling him it had further queries. That is like passing back to the goalkeeper in football, kicking into touch and keeping the pressure off, and it is not acceptable. If people are paying for a service, it should work. When people apply for registration, it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>If the Land Commission is dealing with a query, it is best to forget about it because it will take ten or 11 years to deal with. The Minister of the day should put the staff in place in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. For three years I have been tabling questions on this matter. The Minister told me some months ago that there would be extra staff in place. We want extra staff and greater efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Farming these bodies out to the semi-State sector is the Government's answer when it makes a mess of something. We cannot then ask questions about it in the Dáil. If a Member writes to a Minister next year, after the body has joined the semi-State sector, the answer will be that the Minister has no responsibility. That is the best answer the Government can give. The Government has responsibility and my party and I will oppose the transfer of the Land Registry to the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>I call the four Independent Members white sheep. They back nothing. They are just talk, talk, talk, supported by the media. They promise everything at home but when they come here the four white sheep march with the Government, no matter what the issue. I am sick and tired of being abused by young people who are paying for its services but who are not getting these services from the State. I say to the Minister, the Government and the backbenchers who have all disappeared, who are like a football team when losing and have pulled back&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very hard to follow that. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. Over recent years, we, as public representatives, have dealt with queries regarding the Land Registry. Total and utter frustration has been expressed by a large number of people awaiting information from the Land Registry. Solicitors, young people trying to build houses and people retiring early from farming contact us because there is an undue and inordinate delay in the Land Registry office. People in that office say it is because of a lack of staff while the Minister will say it is a lack of resources because the Government proposes extra charges. Looking at this from a business perspective, few companies would try to charge someone more money and provide less of a service.</P>
      <P>I do not know from where the Government is coming on this issue. As Deputy Ring stated, there is not much point changing it to a semi-State body. All we are looking for is an efficient, well run organisation which people can contact to find out what is happening regarding dealings and registry numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my home county of Leitrim, the situation is intolerable and unjust. The Land Registry takes telephone calls for one hour each day. That is incredible. The Minister came to the House and said people will be charged extra even though they are only allowed to telephone for one hour each day. It is incredible to think that in this day and age a Government would make such a pro<Col N="926" /> posal. Extra staff should be allocated to the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>We talk about the consumer and say that the consumer is king. If the consumer cannot get the information, there is no point having such a facility available. I call on the Government not to go ahead with this farcical proposal, to reduce charges and to immediately increase the number of staff in the Land Registry. If the Government wishes to increase charges, it should do so only when Joe Public is happy there is a proper service.</P>
    <P>It is unfair, particularly to young people who find it difficult to buy property at the best of times, to increase Land Registry charges. It places more financial strain on young couples and that is not what the Government should be doing. I call on the Government not to introduce this proposal, to allocate extra staff to the Land Registry as a matter of urgency and then consider the charges. I ask the Minister to intervene because the people of County Leitrim are entitled to more than one hour's telephone communication with the Land Registry. I hope a proper telephone service will be provided to all the counties affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. It is disappointing to hear speakers from the Government side back a system which has utterly failed. The fact that there are over 80,000 applications in the Land Registry speaks for itself. Any Minister or Government worth their salt would be ashamed to have to come to the House to put forward feeble opposition to this motion. If the Government was interested in sorting out this problem, it would accept this motion and would deal with the problem immediately.</P>
      <P>The national development plan was announced a few months ago and there were banner headlines about the billions of pounds which would be spent over the next couple of years. If the Land Registry office is not operating effectively, everything clogs up, which is what is happening. TDs, including Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats TDs, are aware of the situation. People come to my clinic as well as to those of every other TD pleading to get the Land Registry to deal with their problems. Some people have had to wait years. In one case, a man had to wait ten years because the problem was a Land Commission one originally. I do not know what has happened with Land Commission estates. They were not transferred at the time. A lady who wants to apply for the farm retirement pension cannot do so because the matter is stuck in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that staff there are extremely helpful if one can get them. As Deputy Reynolds rightly said, one cannot even get through to the office. One can telephone China on the other side of the world but one cannot get through to the Land Registry office. This is called progress and is part of the national development plan about which we hear. One cannot even make a telephone call to know whether one's site or piece of <Col N="927" /> land is going through. I do not understand how the opinion polls are showing increases in the popularity of the Government and the Taoiseach. The waiting lists for housing, health services and in the Land Registry are a disgrace and any Government which stands over them does not deserve to be re-elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The very valid criticisms of the Land Registry service that I offer in support of this motion are directed at this and, indeed, previous Governments which failed to respond to the obvious needs of the service and not at the overworked staff who in the past seven years have been endeavouring to cope with an increase in transaction traffic in the order of 46%. The Minister's announcement in early February of additional staff, while welcome, does not adequately address the ever-mounting crisis in the Land Registry service.</P>
      <P>I represent in this House the counties of Cavan and Monaghan and these are two of the 16 counties listed for restricted service whereby access to the Land Registry for queries and business by telephone is confined to a single hour per day, between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. from Monday to Friday. I have found, as many Deputies have already said, that this is very restrictive, with consequent difficulties for myself and those I have endeavoured to assist.</P>
      <P>Very recently I was saddened to attend the funeral of a constituent in County Cavan, an elderly lady who had endeavoured to regularise her affairs with the deterioration of her health. Her efforts to have a new folio drafted, as her interest was not previously registered, requiring a mapping of the property, were sadly unfruitful before the expiry of her time in this life. The experience was a disappointing backdrop to her last months, and I was very much aware of that. This is the reality of the distress caused by the delays of, in some cases, up to 15 months in processing cases. On the other end of life's story are the countless young couples who are faced with the trauma of delay after delay causing unnecessary anxiety and stress.</P>
      <P>I specifically suppport the call in this motion and find it odd that any Member would suggest opposing it, that emphasises that a time limit of four months should apply to the processing of all new registration requests made of the Land Registry service. That certainly is a very reasonable target time within which to respond to the public's needs.</P>
      <P>There has been much bantering about decentralisation and various claims and cases made, but let us consider the reality of the service that is the focus of the motion. Without doubt there is merit in the proposal to regionalise the Land Registry service in order to open up the opportunity for the public to have ease of access to the Land Registry within a catchment of counties. That is deserving of serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> I am alarmed at a continuing trend under this Government. I am unconvinced of the merit of a proposal to make the Land Registry a semi-State entity. It is not beyond the bounds of possiblity that it would then be open to consideration to move it entirely into the private sector. Has the Government lost faith in the public sector and confidence in the ability of the Civil Service to provide an efficient and effective administration of the varying sectors remaining under its stewardship? We must reaffirm confidence in the Civil Service in all its shapes and guises and we must ensure that efficiency and effectiveness become the code words and the watch words of that service in all its manifestations. To do that, the Minister and the Government should take on board the very sound and reasonable proposals and arguments put in support of this motion. I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Higgins and Flanagan on tabling this motion. It is one that solicitors throughout the country will be pleased is being finally debated because land registration is a process that frustrates and angers them and their clients when transferring land.</P>
      <P>We are witnessing a conflicting and crazy scenario. On the one hand we have a housing crisis and housing shortage and, through the national development plan, we intend to build 50,000 houses per year, yet on the other hand we have a Land Registry system that is grossly under-resourced which resulted in a backlog of between 80,000 and 90,000 applications pending at the end of last year. How can we continue to build more and more houses yet not improve efficiency within the Land Registry system? Yet, that is exactly what is happening.</P>
      <P>If that situation was not bad enough, in May we are about to witness a significant increase in the charges for land registration. I accept that the installation of a new computer system is required in the Land Registry to improve efficiency. That will be a welcome development when and if it happens. Until the service improves for customers, it is unreasonable and unrealistic to increase charges. This argument is made even stronger when one considers that the service is making significant money at present and is not under costings pressure.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the new fees order is necessary and reasonable because it has been nine years since the fees were last reviewed. However, a timescale of nine years in itself is no reason to increase charges. If fees for land registration are to increase, it must be as a result of improved performance. If anything, the performance has deteriorated rather than improved. Perhaps the fees system needs to be updated but it is not acceptable to increase fees, particularly at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of buying a new house or secondhand home has never been higher due largely to demand significantly outstripping supply. Increasing Land Registry fees will add to the increase in <Col N="929" /> the cost of buying a new house. The Minister said that the increase in Land Registry costs is insignificant in comparison to the overall cost of property. However, if one was to say that to a young first time buyer who is under pressure to pay a high mortgage, that person would reply that this is a cost, however small, that he or she could do without.</P>
    <P>The quality of the customer service within the Land Registry must also be questioned. The recent decision to limit telephone queries from 16 counties, including Dublin, to between 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. each day makes the service about as unuser friendly as possible. The Minister said this decision was made to free up staff to do other work. That statement is nonsense. One can imagine the reaction if a private business, such as a bank, that provides a service to the public on a daily basis, suddenly decided that it would open only for one hour a day to the public because its staff was under pressure and needed time to concentrate on other work. The Land Registry is supposed to provide a service to the public. If its staff are under pressure, we need to provide more staff and improve and upgrade systems of efficiency, rather than directing staff to deal with telephone queries for only one hour a day.</P>
    <P>I accept that some new staff appointments have been made recently by the Minister, but this measure is too little too late given the major backlog that now exists. To be efficient in the future, targets must be set for Land Registry offices. A guarantee that all applications for new registrations will be completed within a maximum of four months is a reasonable target to aim for.</P>
    <P>I do not blame staff in Land Registry offices for delays or inefficiencies. The lack of resources available to them is the cause of the problem. To allow staff to do their job properly and to ensure an efficient and workable Land Registry system for clients, we must modernise, computerise and streamline it as much as possible in order to reduce the paperwork required and simplify the system as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I support the call for more decentralisation of the Land Registry system to improve efficiency. For that reason, I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I have had many dealings with Land Registry offices and I found their staff to be as helpful as they possibly could be given the difficult circumstances in which they work. Like many Deputies, I have visited those offices from time to time and I appreciate the conditions under which the staff work are difficult.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation of the Land Registry has been mentioned. I make no apology for once again calling on it to be decentralised to countries like Monaghan. Access to the Land Registry offices is extremely important to enable people to deal with their queries in a much more efficient way. It is almost impossible for people to gain access to Land Registry offices in Dublin at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" />  I ask the Minister to ensure that all people are treated equally in this context. Young farmers seeking installation aid often have to wait years to get the deeds they require to drawdown £5,500 or £6,000. However, a person in receipt of an EU pension does not have to go to the same lengths, although that person might be able to drawdown an amount of £100,000 over ten years. Those in receipt of social welfare can quote their PRSI number when they submit a query. Young couples who want to get a site on a family farm often have to wait years to get old deeds sorted out. The delays in processing such work must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Given that we are now into the 21st century, it is wrong of the Minister to hark back to 1980s and blame the Government of that time for the present problems. As another speaker said, the main party in Government has been in office for 11 of the past 13 years. Therefore, it is time the Minister grew up. When he was Opposition spokesperson he was one of the best to blame everyone else for what was not being done. It is difficult to understand why the Minister would consider increasing charges at a time when such increases are not required by the organisation.</P>
    <P>I question the Minister's proposal to covert the Land Registry into a semi-State organisation . Having had dealings with the National Roads Authority &ndash; I accept the Minister is not responsible for that organisation &ndash; I appreciate that we want organisations to be answerable to this House so that we can at least ask questions and get answers to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister going back ten years, the important issue is that we have been talking for a long time about converting this organisation into a semi-State body. The Minister has now decided that it is time to do something about it.</P>
      <P>A number of points were raised during the debate. The minimum fee for registration, including a mortgage of a new house, is £250, not £450 as stated by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>There is much confusion with regard to the situation in Waterford which I would like to clarify. The enlightened decision to decentralise to Waterford was made by Fianna Fáil in Government. Under this Minister an increase in the staffing of the Waterford office, from 150 to 162, has been authorised. As the new site in Dublin has been acquired, planning is under way in conjunction with the Office of Public Works for the new headquarters. A new IT programme has been implemented. Services will be available on the Internet. This is especially important for the west because it means that solicitors can now inquire about the status of applications from the western counties <i>via</i> the Internet rather than talking to staff who should be clearing files, and practitioners have welcomed the fact that the arrears are now being addressed because staff are free from dealing with the phone calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> A new Bill is being prepared which will consolidate existing law in this area and modernise where required. Of interest in this regard are the Registry of Deeds Act, 1707, and the Registration of Title Act, 1964. The new Bill will also give effect to the formation of the new company.</P>
    <P>There was confusion with regard to staffing. Deputies called for an immediate increase in staffing in the Land Registry. That is in train.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming referred to the fact that Land Registry official records refer to County Laois as Queen's County and to County Offaly as King's County. That is being examined.</P>
    <P>With regard to questions raised about the Land Commission, Land Commission schedules are somewhat unusual in that once the <i>fiat</i> or vesting order is signed by the Land Commission, the land is deemed to be registered. Registration in the Land Registry simply records the effect of this on the schedule. The owner is the legal owner. For this reason schedules are not given the same priority as other registrations in the Land Registry, but there is no reason the land cannot be sold on. In most cases where a sale must be completed, it is given priority on request.</P>
    <P>No cogent argument has been made for deferral or non-implementation of the fee review. If an improvement in the service is required this cannot be delivered without real investment in the organisation in order to meet the demands of the modern commercial environment. It is clear, as the Minister pointed out earlier this evening, that the way forward lies in semi-State status and that the fees review is not only an essential element but is also a fair and balanced measure.</P>
    <P>In assessing the various contributions to the debate, what has emerged is that the course that has been mapped out for the registries is the correct one for the future of land registry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on putting it forward.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Government backbenchers, the Minister of State and the Minister are not aware of the problems in the Land Registry. I often wonder where they go when they get into Government.</P>
      <P>I have the highest regard for the staff of the Land Registry in Chancery where I am a regular visitor on behalf of my constituents. A visit there puts me very much in mind of the soap opera &ldquo;Upstairs, Downstairs&rdquo;. One arrives at ground level in Chancery Street, is given a ticket on presenting one's folio number and dispatched upstairs where one receives the file one requests. One is then told to go downstairs where there is an inspection room. When one has carried out the inspection one is requested to bring the file back upstairs, or it can be left and a staff member will take it. On both journeys one could be knocked down by unfortunate staff members rushing upstairs and downstairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> It does not surprise me in the least that the telephones are manned for only one hour a day, from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. How would I, as a public representative, hold my seat in this House if I were available to my constituents for only one hour a day? How would the Minister hold her seat? How could anybody do business on that basis? How could a doctor or a solicitor carry on a practice, how could a corner shop operate, if they were only open for one hour a day? Here we have a Government body that is available to the public for one hour a day. The Minister of State can say the office is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is open to people who are within reach of it but for the people of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, it is not. This city is impossible to get into or out of. It is a nightmare, and people are being asked to travel the distance to Chancery Street to inspect files. The staff are very helpful, but the office is understaffed so that it is quite impossible to do business. It is a nightmare for a young couple who are already in the nightmare of purchasing a site on which to build a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a good person, but is her Government aware of the number of planning applications, of the amount of development which is taking place, of the number of young people seeking to establish a home, and that every item, every detail requires a map? The country is awash with money but one will not get a penny from a lending institution until one has title deeds, and that is a nightmare for every young couple who ever went about purchasing a site. Because of the current economic climate, the vendor is quite happy to leave things as they are. He is getting his £25,000, £30,000 or £40,000 for the site and is quite happy. The pressure is on young couples to get the title deeds and their solicitor is up to his ears in work. It is a great time for the country, but it is a horrible time for young people trying to establish a home. On top of this, one can phone the Land Registry only between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. Most of the time one cannot get through except to an answering machine and there is nothing more frustrating. Who else would be in business if they were available for only one hour a day? </P>
    <P>On top of all that, the charges are being increased. We have big business, developments, multinational companies, we have it all, and it all involves land title deeds, many of which are antiquated, many of which are not up to date. However, the people we must be concerned about are young couples who are trying to establish a home, who are out in rural Ireland buying sites. This charge will fall on them and that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for one moment the comments of Government backbenchers to the effect that this is a ploy by Fine Gael because we have nothing better to do. There is nothing more important than having a properly functioning office. There are far too many waiting lists. This is the Government of waiting lists &ndash; in health, housing and now we have over 80,000 appli<Col N="933" /> cations waiting to be processed with the list growing daily. We have a promise to increase staff and to put in better equipment. Promises will not deal with the current problems. The Chancery Street office is antiquated and out of date. The Minister should go out and get a green field site. He should come down to Cavan-Monaghan where we will give him good value for money. I have a preference for Cavan, but I have a regard for Monaghan too. Whether it is Cavan or Monaghan or on the border in Cootehill, an ideal location, a good green field site, the Minister should come and put up a modern office and hire staff and advisers who would be very happy to live there. They would have a whole new life and would provide a service for the people of that region which is so vitally important. I urge the Minister to take a serious look at Deputy Higgins's motion and to take its proposals on board. If he does he will be doing a good night's work for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister said. It has no credibility whatsoever. We have a body here that is making very substantial profits, over £5 million a year. There is no reason to increase fees as the Minister has done. It is my view, and the Minister has confirmed it this evening, the fee increase is probably contrary to the legislation, it is properly challengeable through the courts, and if it were challenged, the challenge would succeed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has confirmed to the House this evening that the main reason for increasing the fees was in the context of preparing for moving the Land Registry to semi-State status. The Government decision of 14 December 1998 regarding an increase of 20% in fees is aimed solely at this objective. The Minister quoted the relevant legislation. Section 14 of the 1964 Act provides that the fees shall, in so far as possible, be so fixed as to produce an annual amount sufficient to discharge the salaries, remuneration and other expenses payable under and incidental to the workings of the Act. These workings are fulfilling the functions of the Land Registry. There is no question in the context of that legislation of the Government being entitled to build up a nest egg for any future plans it may have for the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify at a later stage what advice has been obtained from the Attorney General regarding the possibility of increasing the fees for this purpose. I believe the fee increase is <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation and open to challenge in the courts and that if it was challenged, it would be held to be invalid. Aside from technical legal arguments, at a time when young people are under extra pressure in the purchase of houses, there is no basis for adding additional expense to the fees they must incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a misleading statement earlier. He said the Government had made a decision in relation to increasing these fees but <Col N="934" /> he did not indicate that any other decisions had been made. In the context of information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, it is clear that a Government decision has already been made to increase these fees by a further 10% next year. There is already provision for an increase some years thereafter. This is the approach of a Government which is constantly bewailing the impact on people of the substantial increase in house prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out the different level of fees but the increases have upped the overall fees that are payable by the overwhelming majority of people who make house purchases. This is being done in circumstances in which the service that is being provided is grossly inadequate and inefficient. This is not a criticism of the staff of the Land Registry, but of the failure of the Government to recruit the number of staff necessary to meet the demands being made on the registry and also to adequately train the staff so that they are fully qualified to carry out the functions for which they were recruited.</P>
    <P>Serious issues arise in terms of making the Land Registry more efficient. In the context of the overall legislation, efficiency is not a matter of satisfying the whims of the legal profession but ensuring that customers' or consumers' rights are fully and properly protected. The ordinary man and woman in the street wants his or her title to the property purchased by them registered as soon as possible and as cheaply as possible. The new legislation the Minister mentioned should contain a provision for ongoing quality control assessment. It should provide that the Director of Consumer Affairs plays a role in this and in relation to future fee increases.</P>
    <P>The Law Society originally advocated the proposal to turn the Land Registry into a semi-State body. However, in the context of experience over the past two years, there are serious grounds for concern as to whether the public interest requires that such an arrangement be implemented. It should be reconsidered. There is not a particular reason for creating a semi-State body and imposing additional charges for the purpose of establishing a body that will no longer be accountable to this House if it fails to properly fulfil the functions for which it was established. A better system should be considered. There should be a rethink.</P>
    <P>The additional charges being imposed are entirely unnecessary and it is a scandal that there is a huge backlog of properties and titles for registration when the body is making a substantial profit to the benefit of the State from its work. If more people were recruited to work in the Land Registry, there would be greater profit, the turnover would be more efficient and the service would be better to the benefit of the public who rely on the Land Registry to register the titles presented to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The Minister should revoke the Registry of Deeds fees order and instead introduce legislation to simplify the procedure for registering deeds. A simplified procedure would cost less and obviate the necessity for increasing fees in this area. There is no reason a simple Bill reforming the Registry of Deeds should not now be introduced. There is no reason to wait for the proposed Land Registry legislation. While there may be some argument for a small increase in Land Registry fees, increases should not add to the burden on first time buyers who currently are largely exempt from stamp duty. They should also be exempt from Land Registry fees. These fees should not act as a further catalyst to an already overheated property market. Essentially, the Minister has imposed additional fees in circumstances where they are unnecessary, on consumers who are not fully aware of the nature of the decision made by the Minister or who do not fully understand the financial impact on them of that decision.</P>

        <b>:</b> The fact that 24 Deputies considered it worthwhile to contribute to the debate speaks for itself. It shows how serious and relevant this matter is to so many areas of life and to Deputies in their constituencies. I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate although there was a marked contrast between the 14 contributions supporting the motion from members of the Labour Party, Deputy Ó Caoláin of Sinn Féin and the 12 Fine Gael Deputies and the ten contributions from Fianna Fáil Deputies. Most of those ten Deputies defended the indefensible, with the exception of Deputy Michael Kitt who was frank, honest and realistic. The others trotted out the same ritual diatribe churned out by the Government script factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion was tabled because the service is not delivering and there is a 65 week waiting list. A total of 16 counties now have a telephone service for one hour a week. Matters which should take approximately 24 hours to process are taking months and it takes years to check out and regularise title. The figure given earlier was 86,000 at the end of last year. However, the Minister gave me the actual figures at 4 p.m. today. These show <Col N="936" /> the number for Clare, Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo is 20,740. The number for Dublin is 15,000 while the number for Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Meath and Monaghan is 16,211. The figure for Cork is 10,400 while the number for Kerry, Limerick and Waterford is 9,162. The number for Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary and Wexford is 17,557 while the figure for Kildare and Wicklow is 5006. The previous total of 86,000 in December 1999 is now 95,324.</P>
    <P>As and from 4 April, there will be industrial action in the mapping section of the Land Registry. This industrial action has been notified to the Minister's Department and from 4 April there will not be co-operation in terms of utilising new technology. One can imagine the chaos this will cause.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has been extremely constructive. There has been nothing negative and no attempt to do down the Government other than to appraise the Minister of the reality of an office that comes under his command. We have been positive, constructive and reasonable. As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, we have set down reasonable targets within which certain services can be delivered. We are seeking more staff and greater efficiency. We are seeking a faster turnover and reasonable deadlines and the freezing of fees in the interim.</P>
    <P>The Government will vote down the motion but the battle will not end there. The Government is mistaken if it thinks the battle will be over if it buries our motion. The battle has not begun and we will continue the fight until we achieve what this motion sets out to achieve, namely, reasonable deadlines and reasonable targets on which any organisation operating under the aegis of a Department should be able to deliver. On decentralisation, this motion does not have any designs on the office in Waterford. Apart from having one office in Dublin to serve the Dublin catchment area, we are seeking, through this motion, to have the rest of the Land Registry services taken into the provinces where they will be more accessible.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32. Amendment No. 33 is related and both may be discussed together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&ndash;The Minister shall consider the feasibility of paying a uniform rate of child dependant allowance by increasing the different rate to the maximum rate and also the issue of extending child dependant allowances to recipients of unemployment benefit and other short-term payments in respect of children aged between 18 and 22 years who are attending full-time education and not later than 6 months from the passing of this Act shall prepare and lay a report on same before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three different rates of child dependant allowance. The first issue in the amendment concerns amalgamating the rates and increasing the two lower rates to the top rate so that there would be one rate of child dependant allowance. The second issue concerns extending child dependant allowance to recipients of unemployment benefit and other short-term payments in respect of children aged between 18 and 22 who are attending full-time education. This is a serious issue. If they are the children of those in receipt <Col N="939" /> of unemployment assistance, child dependant allowance is payable but it is not if they are the children of those in receipt of unemployment benefit. This is considered to be unfair by those in receipt of unemployment benefit who believe they are being discriminated against. They have made their contributions and have the huge additional expense of keeping their children in third level education. I can vouch for the expenses that apply for children in that category.</P>
    <P>The third issue arises under amendment No. 33. This concerns the general level of child dependant allowance which has not been increased for a number of years. The perceived wisdom over the past eight or nine years is that any changes in child support should be concentrated on child benefit. As a consequence, with the broad agreement of all parties, there have not been increases in the child dependant allowance. That would be fine if child benefit had been sufficiently increased. Child dependant allowances should be looked at again in the context of our changed economic circumstances. There may be a case to resume increases in the child dependant allowance. I have spoken to people who I regard as experts in this area and they say the matter should be reopened.</P>
    <P>Those are the three reasonable requests we in Opposition are making in these two amendments. If the Minister cannot accept these amendments, I would be reasonably satisfied if he looked at them in the context of changes to be made later in the year. The suggestions are valid and I hope the Minister will respond positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to outline what is involved in these amendments. Regarding child dependant allowance, there is a different regime for children in different families. For example, an unemployed person receives £13.20 per week for a child, a lone parent receives £15 per week and someone in receipt of invalidity benefit receives £17. This raises the question of equality in the eyes of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Government. How can the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs preside over a situation where those children are treated differently? There is quite a difference in the minimum and maximum payments of £13.20 and £17, respectively. This represents a huge amount of weekly household income. If two children are involved, it is £8 per week which is £400 a year. This is a great deal of money lost to the families concerned. The Minister will say it is too expensive to change the system and there are better ways of doing it. The reality is that it is unjust that children in different families should be treated differently. The Minister must address this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to hear again that there were 17 different rates of child dependant payments which have now been reduced to three and we <Col N="940" /> are doing quite well, thank you very much. That is history &ndash; we do not want to hear about it. I want to hear of a fair way to treat all children equally. The way to do this is to have the same level of payments. I know the political difficulties the Minister would face if he said he was going to standardise the payments at a rate of £13.20 or £15. However, it would be reasonable if he could do it gradually by increasing it from £13.20 to £15 and then to £17. I hope the Minister will consider doing this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a sensible man who is in touch with his constituency. I am sure he receives the same complaints as I do from people on unemployment benefit who do not receive the child dependant allowance when their children go on to higher education and do not understand how someone on UA whose child goes on to third level qualifies. Someone on UB will say they are drawing stamps and they have paid into the system for years yet their neighbour who has been drawing UA for a long time receives the additional payment. This cannot be justified and the Minister must do something about it.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if the Minister put on his legal hat and thought about the possibility of a challenge in the courts. The Constitution states all children must be treated equally.</P>

      <P>Yes there is. If a lawyer was brave enough to take a case, there would be grave embarrassment and the Government would again be faced with making huge repayments to families, backdated over a long period. Perhaps the Minister is the one who can do something about it. A great deal of our recent legislation has related to equal status and treating immigrants properly. Yet, our Government is treating people differently. We raised a similar issue regarding FIS and the self-employed earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister must bite the bullet on this issue. He must give a commitment. We will accept it if he says he cannot do it this year but he should give a commitment that something will be done in the next two or three budgets. Perhaps it will be a radical move but in the long-term the Minister will be seen as not having served the families who need support most if he does not address the blatant anomalies in the child dependant allowance. I ask the Minister to review the matter and give us a commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue, which I explained on Committee Stage. When I first became Minister, during one of my first Question Times, Deputy De Rossa, my immediate predecessor, thoroughly questioned me on whether I would continue the policy direction taken by his Government regarding the freezing of CDA and the concentration of <Col N="941" /> resources on increases in child benefit. I gave an undertaking to examine the position and having done so, in consultation with my officials, I considered the policy enunciated by the previous Government and supported by the then Minister, Deputy De Rossa, as correct. A great deal had been done by previous Governments to rationalise CDA and as the previous speakers said, I reduced it from 17 rates of payment to three. In the early 1990s, CDA was frozen at a particular rate and all the moneys available for child support was put into child benefit. The rationale was that the loss of CDA acts as a disincentive to people returning to work whereas CB is not a disincentive because people receive it irrespective of whether they are in work. To bring all the payments up to the top rate would cost £44.5 million.</P>
      <P>In 1994, child benefit represented 29% of the CB and CDA payment for a four child family. It currently represents 41% and from September of this year that will rise to 47%. Having discussed this with my officials, I consider this policy direction correct and we will continue in that vein. An examination must be carried out with regard to the rationalisation of all child related payments.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath asked about its legality. It is open to anybody to challenge it. There are plenty of lawyers who would chase a few court cases as, to a certain extent, some of them would chase ambulances. Nobody has done so yet. One could extend the logic of the Deputy's argument about different rates to the entire social welfare system. There are personal rates, QAA rates and so forth. It is the same logic. There always have been different rates of payment depending on circumstances. I doubt there ever will be a situation where that will not exist.</P>
      <P>However, there should be a desire to rationalise the system and make it as simple as possible. That is why 17 different rates were reduced to three in this instance. That is also the reason I rationalised the pre-1953 issue and the rate bands in this budget. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that it is a disincentive to returning to work. It might have been a disincentive in the past but when people who have been on social welfare for some time go back to work, they receive the back to work allowance. The child dependant allowance makes up a substantial part of that. The Minister cannot use that argument any more. This is something the Minister will have to review again. There is a serious anomaly there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. There are two issues involved. One is general child dependant allowances. I thought the Minister would be open to the new thinking about them. I accepted and ple<Col N="942" /> aded for a concentration on child benefit instead of child dependant allowances because of the circumstances that applied at the time. However, circumstances have changed and we should look again at whether a higher rate of child dependant allowance should be paid.</P>
      <P>There is no answer to the point made by my colleague. It makes no sense to have three rates of child dependant allowance. How does one value a child? A child in one category is as expensive to rear as a child in another. One is, therefore, depriving the children in the two lower categories. The same applies to children in higher education whose parents are on UB. That is unfair. It should have been changed but was not. We have only received promises about it.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the implications of enabling part-time workers who have been in receipt of unemployment benefit for the prescribed period to continue to receive unemployment benefit payments based on their continued payment of PRSI since first commencing part-time work.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised on Committee Stage. The amendment would affect many women who are in receipt of short-term benefit from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It arises from a query from a number of women who, having worked full time for a number of years, were put on short-time work in their place of employment. Working three days a week they were entitled to draw their stamps for three days a week. Their entitlement, which arose from many years of contributions, meant they could draw for 390 days. The 390 days at three days a week gave them 130 weeks of additional payments under the UB scheme.</P>
      <P>They continued working for the two and a half years which brought them to the 130 weeks. When the UB ran out, they felt they were entitled to draw on the contributions they had made during the 130 weeks and to continue to receive some payment. The rules of the scheme provide that if a person has a certain number of stamps in the governing tax year, one is entitled to the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is one exception, effectively a clawback by the Department, which states that the person must also have suffered a substantial reduction in payment. This is the clause which affects these women. They have been working three days a week and have been receiving social <Col N="943" /> welfare at the same time. However, if they wish to continue to work for the three days, they cannot qualify for social welfare at the end of that period, even though they have the stamps, because they will not suffer a substantial loss in earnings.</P>
    <P>I believe that clause was inserted to exclude those people. They meet the requirements in every other way but the Department wants to stop them getting their payment. Who does it affect? It affects women who, for whatever reason, had to reduce the amount of work they were doing. They will say, correctly, that by working three days a week they are giving other people the opportunity to work three days a week as well. They are giving them an opportunity to earn a few pounds and at the same time make a valuable contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>This matter should be given serious consideration by the Department. It is unfair that the clause should exclude these women. I believe it is a case of discrimination against women. I have not encountered any men affected by it. Women believe they are being got at, as it were, simply because they are women and their work was reduced from full time to part time. The Minister should undertake to review this and do something about it in the longer term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This arose as a result of social insurance being extended to part-time workers. The social insurance system was extended to anybody earning £25 per week or more. About 27,000 part-time workers were included in the system for the first time. It meant, in effect, that they would be insured for pensions and other benefits.</P>
      <P>As a result, changes had to be made to a number of schemes, particularly unemployment benefit. The objective of UB is to provide a replacement income for people who have lost their full-time jobs. As so many part-time workers, some of whom normally work only one or two days a week, were covered by social insurance, it was necessary to review the conditions of UB to ensure they were in line with the scheme's objective. The new arrangements required the claimant to have suffered a loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first, the regulations provided that employment lost had to be at least two days for persons normally working four or more days in the week and one day's loss for persons normally employed from one to three days. In 1993 this requirement was reduced to one day in all cases, and subsequently with effect from September 1994, casual workers were exempted altogether from the substantial loss of employment rule. However, it still applies in some cases, but it arises because part-time workers are now in the scheme. It could lead to a situation where people could qualify for UB who would not in effect be entitled to it <Col N="944" /> because they could perhaps use the system for their own benefit. The matter will be kept under review but I cannot promise that we will change it because once part-time workers are included in the system it will be very difficult to police it to ensure that people would not abuse it by working some days while also claiming UB.</P>
    <P>There are anecdotal stories to the effect that people in full-time employment use the UB system to get an advantage over other workers. I have met people in my clinic who have complained that the system has been used in this way while those who genuinely work full-time and do not look to the social welfare system for support must put up with it. The issue will be kept under review but I cannot promise anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 22 to 42, and in page 24, to delete lines 1 to 51.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with the proposed changes to the social insurance fund and these three amendments deal with what effectively amounts to a licence to steal from the fund. Section 29 provides that payments made out of general taxation will in future be taken from the fund.</P>
      <P>Large sums of money are involved here &ndash; up to approximately £80 million per year. An adequate explanation has not been offered as to why these moneys should be raided from the social insurance fund. Now that the fund is in surplus we should be prepared to develop and invest in it for the future in case there is an economic down-turn and substantial draw-downs are required. There is a need, therefore, to safeguard it.</P>
      <P>There is sleight of hand in transferring responsibilities to the fund which heretofore have been met by the Exchequer. As a cautious businessman and lawyer it is contrary to my general way of thinking. Neither the Minster nor the Minister for Finance has give an adequate explanation for this course of action. It raises concerns for me, hence these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues arise here. I do not accept this is underhand. It has been well targeted. Deputy Broughan suggested it was done since the budget to rewrite matters or get some of my Cabinet colleagues off the hook on other issues generally related to the budget. That is not the case and I suggested to him that he should look at the abridged Estimates published last November where some of these changes were indicated.</P>
      <P>This situation did not arise up to now because the social insurance fund had not ever been in surplus. Now that it is in surplus it is logical that any schemes referable to social insurance should be paid for out of the social insurance fund if there is money in the fund to meet them. Any free schemes or any other schemes related to social assistance should also be payable concurrently by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>We are trying to rationalise matters. Any funding for things like the free schemes which are relevant to social insurance payments comes out of the social insurance fund and any payment in respect of free schemes, for example, with regard to social assistance schemes, should be paid by the Exchequer. It is logical that we should do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> On Committee Stage Deputy O'Keeffe asked who manages the surplus and I indicated it was the Minister for Finance. That is laid down in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993. Any surplus would be invested in an Exchequer note for nine months from 10 February of this year with the National Treasury Management Agency. The remainder of the social insurance fund surpluses are invested overnight in the SIF investment account in the Central Bank. When cash flow requirements permit, it is expected that further tranches of the surplus will be put into an Exchequer note with the NTMA. The Minister for Finance has total say over the investment of the fund.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to note that under the NTMA (Amendment) Bill, currently with the parliamentary draftsman, it is proposed to give it a formal investment management role which will enable it to manage Government funds when the relevant Minister requires such a service. This will increase the available options in the management of investment funds, such as the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggest that that the social insurance board arose from the talks on the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness, which is not the case. In its general election manifesto my party promised to introduce a social insurance fund and we said we would create a new board to supervise the financing and operation of the fund. The fund is the workers' guarantee that their benefits will be there for them when needed without interference or means testing. Board members will include representatives of employers, employees, self employed people, retired people and other interested groups. An actuarial assessment of the fund and its future needs was to be placed before Dáil Éireann every three years, but I introduced legislation to provide for actuarial reviews every five years because that was the strong advice of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness proposes to establish a new board and that will be introduced. We will obviously have to wait until the programme is put together but, once that happens, moves will then take place to put the new social insurance board into being.</P>

      <P>The Minister raises more questions in his reply than heretofore existed. He raises the question of the social insurance fund. Will we have a debate in the House on the social insurance fund? What mandate will its managers have? What type of investments will they be able to make? Will they be restricted to gilts or will they be able to invest in equities? If long-term investments are to be made, what type of approach will be adopted? Will it be a conservative and cautious approach? Will the fund mangers have the type of discretion investment man<Col N="947" /> agers in financial houses have? I raise these as questions at this stage.</P>

      <P>I hope it will develop as a fund in a substantial fashion. Now that there is a surplus in the social insurance fund and a chance it might remain in coming years, the issue of the fund should be debated. I do not oppose the fund but I am interested to ensure that it is safe and secure and that an investment approach will be adopted to maximise the available funds so that they will be available to workers in future when they want to draw down their social welfare contributory pension, invalidity pension or whatever.</P>
      <P>That is my basic thinking and I am now faced with what amounts to a raid on the fund. The first approach of the Government to the surplus of the fund is to use part of it as a substitute for Exchequer funding. I am alarmed at that thinking on the part of the Government towards the fund. Can I have a guarantee that we will have a full and proper debate in the House on the future of the fund? Will there be legislation for the fund and, if not, will the Minister ensure some paper is laid before the House so that we can debate it and make some contribution as legislators to what could be a very important issue in future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe. This fund has been established in a haphazard way. We are unclear what it is to be used for in future. There are no strict guidelines and rules on how it is to be used and controlled. It is open to abuse and being raided by Governments of whatever hue which might be formed in future. For that reason, the requests of Deputy O'Keeffe are reasonable and there should be a logical and open debate on the fund in the House at some stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of my colleagues. The Minister, in establishing this fund, should have outlined the guidelines for the drawdown. I understood to begin with that this matter only concerned the future of old age pensions which arose because of the demographic problem of the projected substantial increase in the number of old people. This projected increase necessitated the State to create a special fund to draw on in case bad times returned. I am disappointed the Minister and the Minister for Finance did not formulate definite guidelines for this fund when presenting it to the House. Substantial amounts of money are involved so it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion about this fund. The social insurance fund was established in 1952. I am dealing with the social insurance fund as it exists. It has gone into surplus in recent years for the first time. Under existing <Col N="948" /> legislation which has been in place for a number of years, it is the Minister for Finance who has complete say as to the investment of that fund. That is done through the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
      <P>Regarding a discussion in the House on that, there is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to bring forward a social insurance board to oversee and advise on the future of the fund. That is a commitment with the social partners and legislation will be brought forward to the House which will allow us to have a debate on that area. Discussions will begin with the social partners immediately following the agreement of the programme so that we can set that in train.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue Deputy Carey raised, that is, the reserve fund, the Government gave a commitment to establish such a fund to pre-fund future social welfare pensions. Moneys we have at present will be invested in this reserve fund to pay for future pensions. The Minister for Finance has already taken on board the recommendations in the Pensions Board report which said that this should be done. An interdepartmental working group is examining the legislative and operational issues relating to the creation of such a fund. The role and supervisory structures of a social insurance board will, therefore, need to be considered in the context of the legislative arrangements, including the supervisory structures which will be put in place in respect of the new reserve fund. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, will introduce legislative proposals to set up this fund in the coming months.</P>
      <P>It will not be a slush fund. He said, and it is the Government's decision and position, that this reserve fund will not be open to being raided by this or any future Governments for other issues not related to social welfare pensions. No matter how bad other Exchequer resources might be, this reserve fund cannot be touched to make up a shortfall in the Exchequer. It is being put aside in an exponential way with a substantial first downpayment from the Telecom Éireann sale proceeds and with a commitment to fund it on an incremental basis over coming years. That is the fund to which Deputy Carey referred and I assure him it is not and will not be a slush fund for any future Governments.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputies to accept that the issue of the social insurance fund being in surplus is a new phenomenon. There is no sleight of hand in what we are doing. We are not gaining any advantage from this. It is merely a transfer of proper money from one fund to another. Until now, it did not make any difference because the social insurance fund was in the red and any money which had to be expended had to come from the Exchequer.</P>

I am very anxious that the social insurance fund and the reserve fund be managed to the best possible extent for workers who will avail of them in future. I would like a discussion on that and the opportunity will arise when the legislation is published and I accept that.</P>
      <P>I am more reluctant to accept the Minister's assurances about section 29. I am not entirely happy but I am not in a position to change it at this stage. It is not a good precedent to have the first surplus in the social insurance fund drawn down to cover payments heretofore paid by the Exchequer.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an old chestnut. The amendment seeks to extend the free fuel scheme to the months of the year to which it does not apply. We must bear in mind that when this scheme was first introduced <Col N="950" /> people's standards and expectations were lower than they are now and few people had central heating in their homes. We now accept central heating as standard in our homes and we frequently use it during the months of April to October. Given our changeable weather, it is not unusual to need heat in our homes during April, May and September. For that reason I suggest that the allowance should be extended to recipients during those months.</P>
    <P>People are also living longer so we have more elderly people. They have difficulty moving from one place to another so they tend to sit a great deal of the time which means they get cold easily. I urge the Minister to consider improving the fuel allowance scheme on an incremental basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shortall has made a reasonable case. We should bear in mind that there has not been an increase in the free fuel allowance since 1986. Whether the improvements should be along the basis suggested by Deputy Shortall whereby the payment is extended throughout the year or by increasing the figure since it has not been increased for 15 years is a moot point. It is a valuable amendment in that it focuses our minds on an issue which should be reviewed and improved.</P>

      <P>Extending the free fuel scheme to all recipients by one week would cost approximately £1.8 million and £46.4 million for a full year. I know the Deputy is not asking for that. It is estimated the payment of the allowance for a full year to all persons over 66 who currently qualify would cost in the region of £17 million. Expenditure on this scheme has increased by approximately 20% in the past six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. The sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme in the 1999-2000 fuel season.</P>
      <P>I have examined this issue and I accept I have made few changes. One change I made was to introduce a disregard of £30 after the committee on social affairs requested me to introduce a disregard of £25 in one budget. I have not raised the rate of £5. Some CPI figures suggest that fuel has not increased by much over a period. I put those figures on the record during Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that all public representatives receive representations from the public and criticism about the free fuel scheme. I examined it in the past three budgets and on each occasion I came to the conclusion that it is better to give a higher increase in old age pensions for 52 weeks of the year than to increase the free fuel allowance for 26 weeks of the year. I could have diverted some money from old age pensions and increased the free fuel allowance. However, I made the case to the Department of Finance that it is better to give people an extra pound of two for 52 weeks of the <Col N="951" /> year rather than for 26 weeks of the year. That view was confirmed in the review of the free fuel scheme, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, which suggested it would be better to give increases in the primary payments. In the past three budgets the primary payments have increased by £18 per week which is substantial. I accept it is an issue I might examine before I leave office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage and he identified a number of situations where there is no access to an appeal system.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that it is better not to set up a formal structure of appeal for non-statutory schemes because it gives some flexibility. If a deciding officer has to implement the legislation in place for a scheme such as the back to education scheme, although it is an administrative scheme, the letter of the law would be implemented. There is some flexibility in having <Col N="952" /> a non-statutory system. Establishing a system of appeals would tie people's hands.</P>
      <P>The system in operation at present provides for the right of review by a more senior officer over and above the original decision. That system has worked reasonably well, therefore we should not endeavour to fix it. Under the back to education scheme people do not qualify because they are a couple of days out of the system. In some cases they qualify because of flexibility in the system.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 30, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;34.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of the Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of the local authority financial contributions scheme for the social assistance entitlements and secondary benefits of scheme participants.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important amendments tabled by the Labour Party. There is a serious housing crisis in Dublin and the corporation has taken an innovative approach which has proved very successful with senior citizens who are concerned about the size of the houses they are trying to manage as they get on in years and about security, which is very relevant in Dublin. The local authority is in desperate need of family houses and is offering a contribution scheme so that senior citizens can move to more appropriate housing in their own area which they can manage and which is safe and secure. This is a very popular scheme which is a win win situation for local authorities which obtain family houses which they can relet to families on housing waiting lists.</P>
      <P>However, an obstacle to the successful implementation of this scheme for people in receipt of social assistance payments is that they end up with a lump sum which is taken into account as regards their welfare entitlements. Dublin Deputies strongly feel that there is a need for a disregard for people who avail of the contribution scheme. I hope the Minister does not give the typical response that housing is not his responsibility and that he is only interested in social welfare issues. This calls for a broader approach across a number of Departments which need to be pragmatic and sensible about this issue and come up with a proposal and a solution which will tackle the real problem which hampers Dublin Corporation in particular from addressing the housing problem and facilitating elderly people. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by the case made by Deputy Broughan on Committee Stage <Col N="953" /> and by Deputy Shortall. It seems in accord with national policy objectives that the senior citizens surrender scheme should be encouraged in every possible way. Deputy Shortall's point is correct in that while the Minister does not have a direct involvement in this scheme, which is more a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government, indirectly he has a crucial role to play. In so far as the means test operates as an obstacle to this scheme, the appropriate amendment should be made taking into account the narrow scope of the capital which will arise. There is a pay back of some of the capital for the alternative, smaller accommodation supplied and a provision could be built into the means test that any capital sourced from this scheme could be disregarded. The overall national policy objective would dictate such an approach and I am happy to support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worthy amendment. Even though we are coming to the end of Report Stage this issue should be given serious consideration. Pensioners who bought a three bedroom house from the local authority, who are prepared to surrender the house to the authority for a payment and move into smaller accommodation, are freeing up that house to help ease the housing crisis which is particularly bad in Dublin, due to land shortages and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister would need to co-ordinate such an approach with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and, perhaps, other Ministers to introduce a scheme whereby money sourced by the surrender of a house does not affect the schemes for which pensioners qualify. There is a precedent for such a policy. During the debate on this Bill we talked about disincentives to work and other things. There are disincentives for people to avail of the seniors buy out package because of the clawback of, perhaps, losing a medical card, the free fuel allowance or other means tested schemes. However, the benefits for society of a large take up for this scheme would far outweigh any disadvantages which might accrue from offering such incentives.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will bring this matter to Cabinet soon. He will need the support of other Ministers but it is a worthwhile proposal. A previous enlightened Government introduced a provision whereby, if someone took a job under the back to work scheme, they would not lose social welfare benefits. So there is a precedent for what is being proposed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Shortall and Broughan for tabling this amendment. This issue was thoroughly discussed at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting some months ago when Deputy Noel Ahern led the charge. Having listened to the arguments at that meeting I gathered that many of the issues related to the loss of the medical card rather than social welfare entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an enlightened scheme operated by Dublin Corporation whereby, if a person arranges to sell their house to the corporation or on the open market and is then housed by the corporation in a senior citizens type accommodation, a proportion of the proceeds of the sale of the property is retained by the owner. The applicant may sell the house themselves or it may <Col N="955" /> be bought by the corporation and the applicant is then housed, usually in a senior citizen's flat. The applicant must make a contribution to the corporation. This contribution will be one third, one quarter or one fifth of the proceeds of the sale of the house.</P>
    <P>The sale of residence provisions under my portfolio have been in effect since October 1991. These allow a person aged 66 or over who is in receipt of a means tested payment from my Department to sell his or her residence and either buy or rent alternative accommodation, or move into a private nursing home, with the balance of the gross proceeds being exempt from the means test subject to a ceiling of £75,000 &ndash; a substantial amount. The person would be entitled to retain up to £75,000 without the means tested payment being touched.</P>
    <P>In view of increased house prices, particularly in Dublin, we have undertaken a review of the sale of residence provisions and it is nearly complete. Recommendations will be made to me in the near future. Once those recommendations are brought forward I might be able to do something in this area. There is currently a disregard of £75,000 and, hopefully, the recommendation will be to increase that. I changed the capital assessment regulations recently and that will also allow people an entitlement to capital without it being taken into account in the means tested payments.</P>
    <P>The system is reasonably good and the review will probably recommend that we raise the £75,000 limit. The main bone of contention is not necessarily in my remit &ndash; it could be the loss of a medical card once a person receives a substantial amount of money. The Ministers, Deputy Martin and Deputy Dempsey, and I undertook to consider the matter after it was raised at a meeting of the parliamentary party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the urgent need to reform the disabled drivers and passengers tax concession scheme to include persons with severe disabilities not currently covered by the scheme. I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other Members, I have received a number of representations from constituents concerning the limited nature of this scheme. The complaint is straightforward &ndash; the medical criteria are too strict for people with severe disabilities to comply. This results in much frustration for the applicants and the senior area medical officers, who are forced to administer a system which is designed to meet the transport needs of people with severe and permanent mobility restrictions, but the qualifying criteria of which categorically deny many of this group from qualifying. The feeling is that there is a scheme in <Col N="957" /> operation which recognises the transport difficulties of people with disabilities but limits to a small minority those who qualify.</P>
    <P>The scheme is intended to facilitate people with severe disabilities in their mobility so they can live life as fully as possible. The medical criteria for the scheme are that, for the purposes of the Finance Act, 1989, the eligibility on medical grounds of disabled persons who are severely and permanently disabled shall be assessed by reference to any one or more of the following criteria &ndash; persons who are wholly, or almost wholly, without the use of both legs; persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg, such that they are severely restricted as to the movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly, or almost wholly, without the use of both hands or arms and wholly, or almost wholly, without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, as a medical doctor, will be aware that a number of those criteria do not match any medical condition. It is extremely frustrating for many medical officers to come across people who are severely disabled and who simply cannot get out and about without a specially adapted car to drive or in which travel as a passenger. If we accept that people with severe disabilities have rights to live life to the best of their ability, then there is a moral onus on the State to support and facilitate them in terms of their mobility.</P>
    <P>People with very common disabilities do not qualify under those strict criteria. I am talking, for example, about people who have had a severe stroke and who are paralysed and do not have the use of an arm or who drag a leg. These people are desperately trying to rehabilitate themselves, sometimes to return to work on a part-time basis so they can be rehabilitated, and get back to a normal life. Those people do not qualify.</P>
    <P>People with severe arthritis, arthritic knees or hips, who have considerable difficulty getting around and cannot really walk more than a few yards, desperately need a car or the use of a car to get out and about and to live life normally. However, people with severe arthritis do not qualify. People with osteoporosis who are severely restricted in their movements and who, for their own well being and that of their family, should be entitled to live a normal life, should be facilitated by travelling by car as a passenger or as a driver. None of those people qualifies under the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>An expert group is looking at this matter but it is clear from several parliamentary replies I have got that there is no sense of urgency in relation <Col N="958" /> to the work of this group. Its consideration is constantly being delayed. The most recent reply I got seemed to indicate that it will be at least another year before there is a decision. I ask the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention, to ensure the expert group reports within a reasonable time &ndash; say within the next three months &ndash; and that there is some action so that people who are severely disabled will be supported by Government to live normally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs. The scheme was later extended to allow for relief from VAT and excise duty &ndash; motor excise duty was replaced by vehicle registration tax with effect from 1 January 1993 &ndash; on the acquisition of a vehicle and from excise on the petrol used. Medical certification was by the disabled person's doctor and required that the person be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his (her) legs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The limited medical criteria applying under the scheme were seen as being excessively restrictive and, in addition, the piecemeal fashion in which the scheme developed gave rise to a number of anomalies and abuses. Therefore, a framework for a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided for under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989. The regulations made under that Act set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and various procedures to be complied with in order to qualify for benefit. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, came into operation on 21 December 1989.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. Essentially, those without the use of limbs, as distinct from those who are just weak in the limbs, will qualify. These regulations were drawn up following wide ranging consultation with the Departments of Health, Environment and Justice, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, Opposition spokespersons for finance and organisations dealing with the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal issue of concern expressed in connection with the reliefs then was, and indeed still is, in relation to their scope. Arguably, the pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its substantial benefit in terms of the tax relief extended. The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons <Col N="959" /> who have severe and permanent physical mobility problems.</P>
    <P>While the number of potential beneficiaries is unclear, there are up to 350,000 persons who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Of course, not all would or could use any widened scheme, but the substantial tax benefits makes for considerable interest in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The issue of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in 1993-4, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to other medical categories. The review recommended that the existing specific medical criteria should remain broadly uchanged. The current medical criteria are designed so that people who qualify for the scheme do so irrespective of the original cause of their disability and this is considered to provide for equitable treatment of those with severe mobility difficulties.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, this scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, the group has representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners. This group is taking this task very seriously. It obviously wants to expedite this matter while coming to a fulsome conclusion in terms of reviewing all the criteria involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is on record as saying he appreciates the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with every day life. There are many people with various forms of disability who would consider themselves as having a genuine case for the tax relief. Given the level of the benefits available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400. On average the scheme is worth up to £800 per year from the refund of petrol excise and £7,500 relief on the price of a new car every two years. There is also exemption from road tax. The cost of relief in 1999 was £17 million compared to £4 million in 1994, which shows just how this scheme is being sought out and used.</P>
    <P>Groups who benefit under the scheme are resistant to the notion of any tinkering with the scheme because they believe that it would not be possible to extend the benefits to other classes of disability without incurring prohibitive additional costs which, they fear, would ultimately result in a lessening of benefits generally. In this regard, representatives of the Disabled Drivers' Association advised the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, at a meeting on 3 July <Col N="960" /> 1998, that they were strongly opposed to any tinkering with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental review group is trying to resolve the very complex issues involved. The group has met on a number of occasions and will be arranging to meet with representatives of a number of organisations and with a number of persons who indicated a desire to make oral submissions. The date for such oral submissions has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be in the coming months. The information furnished at these meetings will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter. I am glad the Minister is here to respond. The issue here is the continuation of service being provided at the breast cancer unit in Mayo General Hospital which is now in doubt arising from a recommendation in a report prepared by Professor Niall O'Higgins. This report is in the context of the Department of Health and Children preparing a national strategy for dealing with cancer, including breast cancer. The report in question has not yet been published. The matter is also about the integrity of Mayo General Hospital and the consequences for the future. It also calls into question the equality of access for women from the county to breast cancer treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to deal with all the issues involved but I want to make a number of fundamental points. There are three consultants in Mayo General Hospital qualified and working in the area of breast cancer. Eighteen breast cancer operations have been carried since 18 January 2000 to today's date. Two clinics per month are held with 25 patients seen at each clinic. Urgent requests are seen immediately with no waiting list and a lessening, therefore, of the serious trauma caused to any woman who has to undergo such examination. A triple assessment is carried out in each case and, if necessary, these include clinical assessments, mammography, with or without ultrasound, fine needle biopsy and aspiration of cyst on the same day when suspicious of cancer, followed by surgery, if required, on the next immediate list with frozen section result, adjuvent therapy by visiting an oncologist/radiotherapist, counselling, availability of prosthesis fitting and long-term follow up clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants and staff involved, who include Paul Eustace, Kevin Barry, Ronan Waldron, Mr. Ravis from the Sudan who is working as a locum, together with the staff under the leadership of Assumpta Walshe and her colleagues, in this vital <Col N="961" /> area in Mayo General Hospital would welcome any audit of the quality of the service provided in the hospital in this area and I recommend that.</P>
    <P>The O'Higgins report is based on a model system employed in England and is not relevant in this region, the third largest county in the country. The report recommends that in the west three specialist units should be set up in Letterkenny, Sligo and Galway. There is neither a history nor an infrastructure of this work in Sligo Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>The women of Mayo are entitled to equality of access to this medical care. I want this service to continue to grow in partnership with University College Hospital, Galway, which currently shares facilities and services. That is where the future lies in this regard.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not overrule the O'Higgins report and, having listened to the views of the chief executive officers of the health boards and the National Cancer Forum, make a decision that this breast cancer unit should continue in Mayo General Hospital, the women of Mayo will lose out as a consequence. That would mean that no breast examinations of any kind would take place there with consequent increased trauma, longer travelling distances and increased waiting lists in Galway or another location. It would amount to a dismantling of hospital facilities in Mayo, which were fought for so hard over 25 years. Phase one and phase two of Mayo General Hospital, which includes the full orthopaedic unit, were delivered during my time as a Minister from Castlebar in a Fine Gael led Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to Mayo General Hospital to open phase two, but I will not allow this service to be removed. I will not stand for it. I warn the Minister of the absolute unity that exists in total resistance to this proposal. I want a guarantee at the earliest opportunity that the removal of this service will not be allowed. The continued operation of this unit is a challenge to the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and Deputy Cooper-Flynn who is chairperson of the Western Health Board. The Minister should overrule the Niall O'Higgins report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time with me. I pay tribute to the work of the staff, the doctors and all those who provide this service. There is outrage in the county since word of this leaked report has surfaced. The people of Mayo are worried that this service will be removed from the county hospital. If it is removed, a woman from Aughleam in Bellmullet, which is 75 miles from Castlebar, which is 40 miles again from Galway, will have to travel 115 miles to avail of a service. Niall O'Higgins's report is only a report, but the Minister is in charge and I wish him well in his appointment. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is from <Col N="962" /> County Mayo and Deputy Cooper-Flynn is chairperson of the Western Health Board. If this service is removed from Mayo General Hospital, I will call for their resignations. This issue is that serious.</P>
      <P>As a person whose family was affected by breast cancer &ndash; a sister of mine died from breast cancer last year &ndash; I will fight the removal of this service politically and in every other way. The women of County Mayo and the husbands, sisters and mothers and of the women of county Mayo will fight to ensure this service is not removed. It is a limited but valuable service, which we are thankful to have and one Deputy Kenny and I, and all the political and community leaders in County Mayo will fight to maintain. I ask the Minister to overrule this report. If he allows this service to be removed, I will call on the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to resign and Deputy Cooper-Flynn to resign as chairperson of the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me this opportunity to set out the current position on the development of breast cancer services. The Minster of State, Deputy Moffatt, and Deputy Cooper-Flynn conveyed to me the views of the people of Mayo on breast cancer services generally and the good work that has been done through the provision of the existing services.</P>
      <P>I was taken aback by the rather overt party political tone of the debate. The report, which I have not yet received, was not prepared by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, or Deputy Cooper-Flynn. It is being prepared by the National Cancer Forum. The Deputies should reflect on that and not jump the gun by endeavouring to politicise the issue on a party basis.</P>
      <P>There have been substantial developments in the care and treatment of patients with cancer throughout the country over the past number of years. Major structured improvements have taken place since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy and the announcement in March 1997 of the action plan to implement it.</P>
      <P>The national cancer strategy's two principal objectives are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. In order to achieve the objectives set out in the cancer strategy, £41 million of targeted development funding has been allocated between 1997 and 2000 to <Col N="963" /> develop a range of cancer services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some of the more significant features of the developments to date are additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, palliative care and histopathology; the introduction of screening programmes including the national breast screening programme, which has commenced, and the forthcoming national cervical screening programme; the publication by the National Cancer Registry of national reports on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in Ireland &ndash; funding of more than £100,000 has been provided to enable the registry to develop a data analysis and research programme; a review of counselling services throughout the country, which is a very important element in the treatment of patients with cancer, this has been funded and carried out through the Eastern Health Board, and the appointment of 24 cancer liaison nurses in the eastern region to improve and enhance the integration and co-ordination of the treatment of cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board, including Mayo General Hospital, has benefited from additional consultant approvals in each of the four specialties I outlined. The total funding made available to the board under the strategy to date has amounted to £3.876 million. The development of radiotherapy services as part of the phase two development at University College Hospital Galway will mark further major progress in this programme of transformation of the quality and availability of services to cancer patients in the region.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to build on these overall developments to date. I am aware that many of the improvements being undertaken nationally have given rise to further demands on existing services available in areas such as radiotherapy services, symptomatic breast cancer services, specialist oncology nurse training and education, palliative care and counselling services. For this reason, reviews have been initiated in each of these areas with a view to achieving a further enhancement, as opposed to a dilution or downgrading of the overall quality and volume of service available to cancer patients.</P>
    <P>In this regard, at the request of my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the National Cancer Forum, which was established and appointed by his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, to advise on appropriate developments and structures in the area of cancer, set up a specialist expert group to examine the symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The forum's advice on how best to achieve that objective will be a central factor in taking decisions as we move forward. It is important to emphasise that I have not yet received the forum's recommendations in this regard. I point out to Deputy Kenny that it is not one individ<Col N="964" /> ual's report, rather it is the National Cancer Forum's recommendations. When he asks me to overrule a person's report, he is asking me to overrule the recommendations of the National Cancer Forum, whatever they may be.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speculate upon or comment on any particular aspect of what will emerge, including the question of appropriate structures to be recommended for the delivery of the service in the Western Health Board region. I am aware that the forum has arranged to meet next week with the health board chief executive officers, who ultimately have responsibility for implementing service developments within their regions. This will provide an opportunity for the chief executive officers to discuss with those responsible for making the recommendations, particular implementation issues relevant to their regions.</P>
    <P>I must reassure the Deputies that any suggestion that Mayo General Hospital is to be downgraded in some way by the Government is completely ill founded. An overall revenue development package of £1.9 million has been made available to the hospital in 2000 to meet the costs of a new CT scanning service, to provide an accident and emergency consultant and to meet the operational costs of the new accident and emergency department, a central sterile supplies department and a geriatric assessment unit which are due to open this year. Overall construction work on the major £22 million phase 2 development of the hospital is continuing. This will greatly enhance the overall capacity of the hospital and enable an in-patient orthopaedic service to be developed there on completion.</P>
    <P>In short, the hospital is experiencing an exciting and unprecedented transformation of the shape and scale of the services it is providing, backed by the unparallelled commitment that this Government has displayed to the development of services for the people of Mayo.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate - Sports Capital Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I raise it particularly because about this time last year, when funds were allocated, the editors of local newspapers carried out surveys which seemed to indicate an imbalance in the allocation of capital grants for sporting facilities up and down the west coast in particular. They reported that it could not even be said that there was equity in the per head of population allocation of these capital grants. I am anxious that criteria be established or for the Minister to say that at least one capital project in each Dáil constituency will be approved each year. I would like the Minister to give an indication of what criteria he expects to use in allocating funds for sports facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> In County Clare there are still parishes in need of good sports fields, halls and recreational facilities. These are vital community projects. In the most western peninsula, Carrigaholt, Kilbaha and the area called Corca Baiscín have applied for additional funding to help them complete their community field. This asset will be most valuable to the community, for the locals, but also to improve the quality of tourism facilities available to families visiting the area.</P>
    <P>I want to see flexibility and a bias towards rural clubs and remote rural areas that need additional funding to develop facilities in their area so that they can attract additional income where farm incomes are falling and where people are tending to migrate. A new field and new facilities give a great boost to an area. Where there is a quality pitch and quality advice given, it is better still.</P>
    <P>I understood the Department was devising a strategy and plan for sporting facilities which would be transparent. In recent times the application form has changed and additional information is sought. However, it gives no impetus to rural policy. The Government's policy in this area is not clearly illustrated. The last allocation of funds was no different to the allocations given by the Government of which I was a member. There has to be a change of attitude.</P>
    <P>Outdoor recreation is one of the greatest assets we can offer. We cannot offer sunshine. When the Minister invited ladies to play golf in Letterkenny the facilities were not up to standard. However, it was good for the economy of Letterkenny and the Minister's image certainly improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to look at seriously at the allocation of such strategic funds. I appeal to him to publish a plan for the creation of capital grants for western and other rural areas. There has to be a bias. In the absence of a tax relief system for sporting events, remote areas have no real opportunity to raise funds. I want to impress on the Minister that there is a need for funds. I do not want to have to come in here in a year's time to say that Clare got only a miserly amount even though it has three Fianna Fáil Deputies, one a Minister. I appeal to the Minister to publish a plan so that the voluntary sector, people who give their time to looking after communities, will be able to apply with confidence for aid and get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Carey for raising this matter on the Adjournment as it gives me an opportunity to put on record again the Government's commitment to the development of sport and recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has signalled its commitment to the development of sport and recreational facilities and I am proud to say that I have in 2000 secured a trebling in the funding for the sports <Col N="966" /> capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to over £15 million this year. This huge increase, taken with the fourfold increase in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3 million to £15 million, and almost £6 million towards the development of Ireland's first 50 metre swimming pool is testimony to the Government's commitment to and its acknowledgement of the role which sport and recreation plays in our country. Under the 1999 sports capital programme, I allocated £20 million to 400 projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The 2000 sports capital programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of applications was Friday, 11 February 2000. Over 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these has now been completed. All the applications received will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. Those are the criteria Deputy Carey asked for. The assessment criteria were recommended following a review of the sports capital programme carried out by my Department in 1998. I hope to be in a position to announce the 2000 round of grant allocations by June next. There are 13 assessment criteria under which the applications are evaluated, a copy of which the Deputy has.</P>
    <P>While all applications will be treated on their merits, the highest priority will be afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation particularly for young people. Those projects where the main purpose is to provide a facility which enables people to take part in sport and recreational sport or to raise standards of performance will also be accorded high priority. Such projects will include, for example, playing facilities, changing accommodation, essential sports and maintenance equipment and training facilities. Lower priority projects will include those which are not essential or integral to sports participation or performance, for example, landscaping of grounds, boundary fences and equipment stores.</P>
    <P>A scoring system has been developed under which individual applications are scored between zero and five under each heading, depending on the extent to which they have met the assessment criteria. Different weightings from one to four are attached to the various criteria, depending on their importance. The highest weighting is given to the disadvantage criteria, given that special priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas. At the end of this process each application receives a score which decides its order of priority in its county. Comparisons between the scores for applications in respect of projects from individual counties show that in some counties a lower overall threshold applies than in others, primarily because of the differing weightings attributed to various <Col N="967" /> assessment criteria, for example, whether the county had disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>Overall outstanding commitments under the programme at the end of 1999 amounted to the phenomenal figure of approximately £29.5 million. These commitments existed between the previous and current Governments. These commitments must be met in 2000 and subsequent years on satisfactory completion of projects in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme. The budget for the programme in 2000 is £15.2 million.</P>
    <P>As I announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, my aim will be to make a minimum of £200,000 available this year to each county. This is with the vital proviso that suitable projects which meet my Department's criteria have been put forward. I stress that this allocation cannot be regarded as automatic. The projects must measure up to assessment on their merits, but this new approach will go a long way towards providing a more even-handed spread of funding between counties and will encourage sports activity in smaller centres.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that I have embarked on the most ambitious sports capital programme ever in the history of the State which will result in our sporting infrastructure being dramatically improved through supporting the many voluntary organisations throughout the country in responding to the increasing demands for the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned golf in the Letterkenny area. In my capacity as the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation I have tried to bring as many tournaments to the west coast as possible. There were events in Ballybunion, east Clare, Galway and Letterkenny. No golfing tournaments were held on the west coast previously. It was lucky there was one in Galway, otherwise, Pádraig Harrington would not have qualified for the Ryder Cup.</P>
    <P>I tried to get as much money as possible spent last year. I prioritised projects which were ready to go. I indicated that they had to be ready to proceed and if there was a digger on the site, they were almost assured of getting funds. However, despite that prioritisation, it was still necessary to hand back £8 million to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>We are trying to deal with projects whose criteria have been assessed and are ready to proceed. The local funding aspect is vital because it shows an intention to go ahead. Under the <i>per capita</i> system used previously, smaller counties did not receive adequate funding. Consequently, this year, I will allocate a minimum of £200,000 to each county because some counties previously only received £50,000 or £60,000 on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>

      <P>On Monday, 20 March I attended a meeting at Ballyagran primary school to discuss problems with the school bus service. In addition to the principal of the school, over 70 parents were in attendance. They have been aggrieved for some time about the inefficient transport system provided for the Ballyagran primary school. They also pointed out that bus transport has been discussed at every monthly meeting for the past three years.</P>
      <P>Pupils at Ballyagran school come from a wide rural area which embraces Castletown, Ballyagran and Colmanswell parishes. Approximately 160 pupils attend Ballyagran primary school of which 104 are eligible for the bus transport system. Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, has two buses which also do school runs to the post-primary schools. The Colmanswell bus is under the Limerick division while the Castletown bus is under the Cork division of Bus Éireann. The Castletown bus is over 18 years old while the Colmanswell bus is over 20 years old. The drivers do an excellent job in difficult circumstances. The children who travel on the buses to the primary school are in the age bracket of five to 13 years.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline some of the difficulties with the buses and I will confine my remarks to December 1999. Regarding the Castletown bus, during December 1999 there was no morning service on two occasions. On two other occasions the bus was between 30 to 40 minutes late collecting the children. The bus driver is not supplied with a mobile telephone by Bus Éireann and the parents council recently took the initiative and provided him with one. Based on their past experience, they want to ensure contact is possible for future anticipated problems with the bus service.</P>
      <P>Regarding the bus which services Colmanswell, on two occasions in December 1999 there was no morning service. On another morning there was no service due to fumes in the bus. The bus broke down on two other occasions in the evening when it was bringing children from the school. The Minister should imagine the situation with young children on the bus and the frustration and worry caused to parents and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only dealt with the catalogue of incidents during last December. The parents and children have been most tolerant of the most unsatisfactory condition of the buses. Complaints have been made to Bus Éireann without success. How can the Minister reconcile a situation where a car registered prior to 1992 is subject to a Department of the Environment and Local Government test but a bus aged over 20 years is not subject to such a test? The parents and pupils have put up with an intolerable situation over the years and they are most impatient and frustrated with the lack of action. It is imperative that the Depart<Col N="969" /> ment instructs Bus Éireann to provide more modern buses to replace the antiquated models now being used. I implore the Minister in the interests of the safety of these young children to provide the reassurance required that replacement school transport will be provided. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is unavailable to take this matter. However, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position on the safety and reliability of school buses.</P>
      <P>The school transport scheme involves travel throughout the entire country in remote rural areas and populous urban centres. This involves the use of approximately 2,500 buses and approximately 5,600 bus routes. A total of 154,000 pupils at primary and post-primary level availed of the school transport service in 1999. All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicles used. Safe set down, turning and pick up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind.</P>
      <P>The safety standards of vehicles used for the scheme is of paramount importance to the Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with <Col N="970" /> immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during the summer of 1999. The age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
    <P>With regard to contractors' buses, the terms of their contract with Bus Éireann require that the vehicles are kept and maintained in a safe and road worthy condition and comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts. Vehicles must be kept clean internally and externally to the satisfaction of Bus Éireann. Contractors' vehicles are subject to inspection and testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses. All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have more than eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</P>
    <P>Great care is taken to ensure that loadings do not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity. The Deputy can be assured that in relation to the school transport scheme, the safety of pupils is of primary consideration to the Department and takes precedence over all other aspects of the operation. Having listened to the Deputy, it would certainly appear that a serious problem exists in his area. I assure him that with regard to the safety and reliability of the two buses serving the Ballyagran national school, County Limerick, an urgent report has been requested from Bus Éireann. The Deputy will be informed of the outcome of that report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 March 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recently published consultation document on new policy proposals for foreshore leases and licences for offshore wind and wave electricity generation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8192/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey): Offshore wind energy is an emerging but proven technology for generation of electricity from non-polluting renewable sources. Wave powered electricity generation is not yet a proven technology and a number of companies are carrying out pilot programmes to develop this technology to the stage where it will be commercially viable. However, some experts in the field expect that it will take to the end of the decade for wave powered generation to achieve the status that wind energy enjoys today.</P>
    <P>Ireland has, in its offshore waters, theoretically, the wind capacity to supply our national electricity needs several times over. This resource is, however, reduced substantially by the limitations of current technology which require that wind turbines be situated on relatively shallow banks offshore. It is also restricted by the capability of the shore based transmission system to carry the electricity produced and by the fact that, in order to produce electricity, wind speeds have to be within specified minimum and maximum levels. For these reasons it is important to stress that wind powered electricity generation offshore, while complimentary to on shore generation, cannot replace it.</P>
    <P>A number of companies have expressed interest in developing offshore wind farms for the generation of electricity for connection to the national grid. It is my policy to encourage the productive use of foreshore and obtain a commercial return for the State from use of State owned foreshore. In addition, the encouragement of the use of non-polluting renewable energy systems, both onshore and offshore, will be essential to our meeting our national obligations under the Kyoto Agreement.</P>
    <P>The use of foreshore not adjoining land for capital intensive commercial purposes constitutes a new departure for my Department and it was considered necessary to devise a separate policy for application of the Foreshore Acts for such purposes. Arising from studies undertaken of the requirements for a wind farm a consultation document in respect of offshore generation was issued on 25 February. This addresses the approach to be taken by and the requirements of my Department in relation to applications for foreshore licences and leases for the purposes of commercial electricity generation on the foreshore. Financial terms which would apply to such <Col N="972" /> developments are also covered as are my Department's expectations from the activities of licensees and lessees.</P>
    <P>The consultation document was sent to those known to have interests in wind energy or electricity generation, to bodies with interests in the maritime environment and, on application, to the general public. Submissions on the document should be in my Department by 31 March and I expect to issue my policy document shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>As soon as policy has been agreed I will be in a position to consider the applications which are with my Department for foreshore licences for site investigation purposes and expect to be in a position to make decisions within a month or so of that date.</P>

      <Quest>the gross registered tonnage of the beamer segment of the Irish fleet in each of the years from 1994 to 1999; and the requirement, if any, for boats which are beam trawling for a period of the year using polyvalent licences to have purchased beamer tonnage before fishing as beamers.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capacity of the beam trawler segment of the Irish fishing fleet, as expressed in gross registered tonnage, was 1,114 GRT in each of the years 1994 to 1997. The capacity fell to 916 GRT in 1998 when one of the vessels in the segment was removed from the fishing vessel register, but increased again to 1,116 GRT in 1999 when the replacement vessel was registered.</P>
      <P>It is a central requirement of fishing vessel licensing policy that a licence will be granted for the introduction of a vessel into the fleet only if the licence applicant removes from the fishing vessel register tonnage and engine power equal to the tonnage and engine power of the vessel to be introduced. It is also a requirement that the capacity to be removed from the register must come from the fleet segment into which it is proposed to introduce the new vessel.</P>
      <P>A licence applicant proposing to introduce into the polyvalent segment a vessel fishing for part of the time by means of beam trawls, is required to remove from that segment the appropriate proportion of tonnage and engine power with an active history of fishing by means of beam trawls. Any such proposals are, however, very rigorously assessed to ensure that a sustainable balance is maintained between fishing effort by means of beam trawls and the targeted stocks.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to a similar question raised in the House on 10 February last.</P>
      <P>Since then I have met with a delegation from the Irish Offshore Operators Association and had a very useful discussion on how Irish industry could increase its share of goods and services supplied to the offshore exploration sector. I highlighted my expectations that Irish companies should be given full and fair opportunities to compete at all stages of exploration and to bid for work. I also expect that every effort will be made to accommodate smaller suppliers.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my reply in February that I was organising a business awareness seminar for the suppliers of goods and services to the exploration and production sector.</P>
      <P>A seminar called Contract Awareness for the Offshore Sector will now be held in Westport on Friday, 14 April next and is being organised by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Offshore Operators Association We are bringing together all interested parties to ensure that our strategies are effective and our bids are competitive in all respects if and when contracts are on offer. I will be able to present, for the first time, to any exploration concern a full and comprehensive inventory of Irish skills and Irish know-how.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Dublin Port Company made application to me for permission, under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, to reclaim 21 hectares of foreshore which is owned by the company in Dublin Port. An environmental impact statement, EIS, was required in respect of the proposed development and this was published on 1 October 1999. During the subsequent statutory one month consultation period, in excess of 400 submissions were received by my Department in relation to the proposal. The vast majority of these submissions were against the proposal.</P>
      <P>My Department was concerned about the adequacy of the EIS and therefore engaged an independent firm of consultants to review it. The consultants furnished a report on 21 February. In summary, the consultants found the EIS to be inadequate under a number of headings, <i>vis</i>. scope of flora and fauna assessment; omission of any consideration of water quality; description of baseline conditions; identification of impacts; prediction of impact magnitude; assessment of impact significance; identification of mitigation measures; commitment to mitigation and content of the non-technical summary.</P>
      <P>My Department accordingly informed the company earlier this month that a new EIS would be required before the application could be considered further. The company was further advised that any new statement should address the specific shortcomings identified in the consultants' report and that it should enter into consultations with, and furnish copies of, any new EIS to those who made submissions during the public consultation period.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the company to decide on what action to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps put it on the record of the House that I am, in principle, favourably disposed toward necessary development for port purposes. Our economy is dependent upon our having strong ports which can supply industry and the public with fast, economic port facilities. Having <Col N="975" /> said that, I am also convinced that such development can only be within the confines of a clear legislative and administrative structure and that a comprehensive co-ordinated approach to such matters is required. To this end my Department is in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government to see if legislative shortcomings can be addressed at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>Licensing of sea fishing boats is governed by section 222B, as amended, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Decisions on licence applications are made by reference to pre-set policy considerations and criteria which have the key objective of ensuring the conservation and rational exploitation of available fish stocks, consistent with Ireland's legal obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy in relation to fleet capacity, fishing effort and conservation parameters.</P>
      <P>In practical terms, licences are granted where applicants comply with a number of clearly defined requirements, including the provision of satisfactory evidence of vessel ownership; appropriate confirmation that the vessel is safe and seaworthy; and satisfactory evidence that the applicant has removed from the fishing vessel register tonnage and engine power equivalent to those of the vessel for which the licence is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a very small number of cases fishing vessel licence applications have to be refused due to failure to comply with the pre-set criteria. In 1999 <Col N="976" /> out of a total of 262 applications 15 were refused. The services of the Ombudsman's office are available to any individual who considers that a fishing licence application has not been dealt with fairly or reasonably. The Department as part of its quality customer service action plan is also working to establish enhanced customer service standards and a customer complaints appeals system across the Department. The establishment of a formal fishing vessel licence appeals system is not therefore in the circumstances necessary.</P>
    <P>In the interests of clarity and transparency I intend to publish comprehensive user friendly guidelines on the fishing vessel licensing process, procedures and criteria at an early date. I have asked my Department to finalise the guidelines as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to merchant vessels. All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are more than 140 ship registers in operation worldwide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All merchant vessels irrespective of flag state are entitled to innocent passage through Irish waters under international law. However, foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port State control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation. Deficiencies identified are <Col N="978" /> brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and must be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
    <P>In relation to flags of convenience, I am advised that this practice, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is permissible under international law. The International Maritime Organisation is establishing internationally agreed safety and manning standards which are enforceable on ships calling at member states' ports. Also, the European Commission has developed proposals to mandate minimum conditions for the manning of ships using EU ports and for the hours worked by seafarers on such ships and these will come into effect before July 2002.</P>
    <P>My Department's marine survey office ensures that Irish flagged vessels meet all relevant international and EU safety requirements. There is little merchant traffic inside the 12 mile Irish territorial limit and merchant vessels passing through or near Irish waters are generally travelling to or from Irish ports or UK west coast ports. Such ships would, of course, be subject to appropriate checks regarding their safety and documentation.</P>

      <P>The gas field off County Mayo, the Corrib Field, has not yet been declared commercial; further appraisal drilling will be undertaken this year and Enterprise Oil hope to be in a position to decide on commerciality in December this year.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development. Calculation of the size of the gas accumulation is too imprecise at this stage based on data currently available but this will be known with more precision once the accumulation has been fully appraised.</P>
      <P>Should the results of this appraisal drilling enable the company to establish that the field is commercial then it will be the duty of Enterprise Oil to apply forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. Within two years of the issue of a petroleum lease the lessee is obliged to submit a plan of development for the field for my approval. Should the field be declared commercial my understanding from the company is that it would be their intention to have the gas in production by mid 2003</P>
      <P>It is required in such plan of development that details be provided on the design, siting construction, establishment, operation, abandonment and removal of facilities, including the export pipeline from the field to the onshore terminal, for the production, processing, storage or shipment of gas produced. Any transmission pipeline downstream of the onshore terminal does not form part of the development and is therefore not subject to my approval, being a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the appraisal programme no decision has been taken on an upstream pipeline location but in the expectation that the further appraisal will be successful, Enterprise Oil has in the meantime a conceptual development plan under consideration which includes analysis of a number of different possible pipeline routes and landfall locations. Initial route surveys have been conducted over several possible routes and more are planned for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note BGE's recent announcement of extending the national grid from Dublin to Galway and Ennis and it is likely that this could have an influence on decisions by the Corrib licensees regarding the marketing of the gas. Of course, the responsibility for the national gas grid is a matter <Col N="980" /> for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in the 2025 report published recently by Bord Gáis, in regard to ways in which expected demand will be met after 2004, the Corrib gas accumulation was identified as one of the three preferred supply options to be considered further. The other two options identified were the duplication of the existing Scotland-Ireland interconnector and the construction of a gas pipeline from Scotland through Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>While I have seen the reported comments and while I understand how they might come to be made, there is no basis whatsoever for the suggestions that there is any reluctance on behalf of the State to avail to the maximum extent possible of whatever scope may exist under international law to deal with incidents against Irish vessels on the high seas which may amount to piracy as defined under international law. As explained earlier in answer to a priority question, examination of these matters is being carried out as a matter of urgency by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>It would not be in the public interest to publish the legal advices received as they relate to matters of interpretation of international law which could subsequently become the subject of dispute between Ireland and other countries at international level.</P>

      <P>The application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Commission by the Irish Administration last August proposed increased premium levels for those who planted under Council Regulation 2080/92 as well as for those proposing to plant in the current season. However, because of the protracted nature of the discussions with the commission, I decided that the primary focus would have to be on securing increases which would have an impact on planting in the current season. The substantial increases announced by me on 6 March achieved that objective.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on that occasion, it is the intention now to pursue the question of adequate increases for those who planted in earlier years. The matter is listed for discussion with Commissioner Fischler next week and will then be pursued at official level. I will remain in close contact with developments.</P>
      <P>I favour a procedure under which premium rates are reviewed at three yearly intervals over an approach based solely on indexation. The latter approach would not, for example, have yielded the increases recently secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exploration in oil and gas resources offshore involves huge financial expenditures and commitments, and exploration programmes decided by companies will reflect their confidence in recovering those costs through discoveries. In the past few years, programmes which were entered into when the price of oil was higher had to be paid for despite a virtual collapse in price. This has led to both large-scale re-structuring within the industry, through acquisitions, take-overs and mergers, and significant cost-cutting measures. These measures have had <Col N="983" /> a major negative impact on exploration activities. In north-west Europe in 1999 exploration and appraisal activity fell to its lowest level since the early 1970s. The recent price increases are merely a recovery of the prices of some years ago, and may lead to increased exploration activity generally. It must be accepted, however, that a more positive approach to expenditure on exploration is likely to be dependent on the prospective duration and level of higher oil prices.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply of 10 February last to another question from the Deputy, there have been a number of commercial developments either planned or carried out by the industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A plan of development for the south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field was approved last year and the field was brought into production in October. There are important developments taking place in relation to two other hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the Corrib field is that Enterprise Oil and its partners, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibenia Limited, have drilled three wells in the Corrib gas accumulation located in the Slyne Trough &ndash; an exploration well in 1996 and two appraisal wells, one in 1998 and the second in 1999.</P>
      <P>Evaluation of all the data has continued over the past few months with a view to establishing a location for a further appraisal well which Enterprise Oil will drill this spring. It hopes to be in a position to decide whether the Corrib gas field is commercial or not in December of this year.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development of the field.</P>
      <P>Should the results of its appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced, it will be necessary for Enterprise Oil to apply to me for a petroleum lease and submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
      <P>The Helvick oil field is held under a petroleum lease by Providence Resources which has declared the field commercial. A detailed plan of development for the field is due to be submitted to me for approval by the end of April this year.</P>
      <P>The present level of offshore petroleum exploration activity comprises 22 exploration licences covering 118 blocks or part blocks. In addition there are six offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for one other licensing option and one lease undertaking are at present under consideration. Two onshore licensing options are also held over the north-west carboniferous basin.</P>

      <P>Offshore fisheries inspection and surveillance is carried out on behalf of my Department, which has policy responsibility for fisheries protection, by the Naval Service and Air Corps. The capital resources available to the Naval Service consist of eight patrol vessels, including the LE <i>Roisín</i>, which was commissioned late last year. The Naval Service's patrol activities are supported and complemented by the monitoring and surveillance undertaken by the two CASA aircraft operated by the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitments in the White Paper on Defence to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of those services to my Department. In that context the development of service agreements between the Naval Service, the Air Corps and my Department will set agreed levels and standards of sea and air support requirements for fisheries protection. Overall the objective is to maximise capabilities within available resources on a value for money basis through <Col N="985" /> better utilisation of manpower and other resources and enhancement of performance, including days at sea, utilisation of patrol days and numbers of boardings and sightings.</P>
    <P>On this basis, and taking account of evolving systems of control including the use of satellite technology, there is every prospect that even with existing assets, the level and effectiveness of fishery protection services can be substantially increased and afford adequate protection and enforcement in the Irish fisheries zone.</P>

      <P>Exploration for oil and gas is a very high risk activity. In Ireland and generally speaking internationally, this risk is carried by private sector companies which invest large volumes of funds testing what they consider to be the best prospects.

Currently, there are three discoveries-developments which are at various stages of development.</P>

      <P>The exploration well was a gas discovery but the operator was unable to test it at the time. The first appraisal well produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day. Evaluation of all the data has continued over the past few months with a view to establishing a location for a further appraisal well which Enterprise Oil will drill this spring.

      <P>Scientific advice for the Irish Sea cod stock, which became available in late 1999, suggested that the stock was in danger of total collapse unless an urgent stock recovery plan could be put in place during the current year. At the December Fisheries Council, the council and commission agreed that a recovery plan would have to be put in place this year to save this valuable fishery. Following detailed consultation with East coast fishermen in January and February discussions took place in Brussels between the commission and the member states and their fishing industries.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the Irish Sea cod recovery plan, involving a closure of the northern part of the Irish Sea from mid-February to the end of April for the directed cod fishery was introduced by the commission on 10 February. As part of the recovery plan the commission had proposed a closure of a large area of the western Irish Sea for prawn fishing for the ten week period. Ireland opposed this closure and worked to keep as much as possible of the prawn grounds open in the interests of our fishermen. A small area of prawn grounds overlaps with the biggest concentration of spawning cod in the Irish Sea. The commission insisted on closing this particular area for the ten week period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that some prawn fishermen will have longer steaming times to get to the prawn grounds during this period. However, the bulk of the grounds are still open for prawn fishing. From <Col N="989" /> the end of April all prawn grounds will be fully open for the rest of the year. Fishermen have indicated that the prawn grounds overall are heavily fished and that prawn catches will in fact probably be better in the areas which are currently closed when the fishery reopens.</P>
    <P>The measures in place to protect the Irish Sea cod stock have been structured to cause the minimum disruption to fishing activity and to retain the maximum range of fishing opportunities possible for East coast vessels. The measures are essential to ensure a viable future for east coast fishermen, they are of short duration and limited impact. In these circumstances the payment of compensation would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>In excess of 400 submissions were made to my Department arising from the public consultation process attached to the publication of the environmental impact statement by Dublin Port Company in respect of the proposed reclamation of 21 hectares of foreshore owned by the company in Dublin Port. In accordance with normal practice, these were acknowledged individually and copied to the port company for its observations. While this process was under way my Department had engaged consultants to examine the adequacy of the EIS. The EIS was found not to comply with statutory requirements and, if the company wishes to proceed, it will be necessary for it to carry out a new EIS and recommence the process.</P>
      <P>A number of months after the public consultation period had ended several thousand pro-forma objections were delivered to my office with a request that they be acknowledged individually. The objections have been noted in my Department. Individual acknowledgement, however, would seriously disrupt the normal day to day workings of the Department and could not be justified. Events have overtaken matters and the issue of whether to proceed with the application, which will have to be accompanied by a new EIS, now lies with the company.</P>

      <P>The report of the Irish emergency towing vessel study was published in January of this year. One of the three recommendations of the study was that an ETV should be deployed in Ireland to empower the State to proactively pro<Col N="991" /> tect its coast and all maritime activities in the Irish pollution responsibility zone, IPRZ, in accordance with the provisions of the intervention convention. Among its functions would be the conservation of ecologically sensitive areas, protection of amenities and marine economic activities, reduction of pollution costs and enhancement of search and rescue activities. The report stated that the most cost-effective method of deploying an ETV would be a dual function vessel having a secondary role in fisheries protection.</P>
      <P>I am giving particular attention to this report and its recommendations. The economic, human and environmental costs of a major oil pollution incident off our coasts are incalculable. If we can put in place on a reasonable cost-benefit basis an infrastructure to prevent such an occurrence, rather than do so after such an event, it is my strong view that we should do so. It is my intention to seek approval in principle before the end of May next from the Government for the securing of an ETV capability.</P>

      <P>As stated by the Taoiseach on 27 January in his reply to a question on the arrest and detention in China of Mr. Zhao Ming and a number of his colleagues, all are Chinese citizens who were resident in Ireland for purposes of work or study. All are active members of the body known as Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities last July. Four of them, including Mr. Zhao Ming, returned to China from Ireland before Christmas and, according to the information received from one of them, variously sought out and engaged in various Falun Gong related activities, including lodging or attempting to lodge complaints with the Chinese authorities on the latter's policy in regard to the Falun Gong movement. As a result of these activities they were arrested by the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Mr. Zhao Ming and two other persons have not been allowed by the Chinese authorities to leave China and I understand they may be under various forms of detention, including house arrest, in their respective home locations. The fourth individual was allowed to leave China and returned to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with its EU partners, has closely monitored the measures taken by the Chinese Government against Falun Gong practitioners. We have expressed our concern, both collectively and bilaterally, about the situation and called on the Chinese authorities to respect the human rights of individuals, including those who are followers of the Falun Gong. We have <Col N="992" /> urged China not to act against the principles contained in the UN covenants which it has signed. These include the important freedoms of expression, assembly and association. We have also expressed concern about the number of arrests and the heavy sentences imposed on members of the Falun Gong movement. The latter concerns also extend to heavy sentences imposed on members of the China Democratic Party and on members of Christian churches.</P>
    <P>As Mr. Zhao Ming is not an Irish citizen, Ireland has no consular function in this matter. As a Chinese citizen, he is subject to the laws of China while in that country, including in respect of Falun Gong.</P>

      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airport policy.</P>
      <P>The position of Baldonnel was considered in the recent Warburg Dillon Read/AIB report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin, particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>I note that, with regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approval. They believe that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging.</P>
      <P>These issues are addressed in the advisers' report which is now publicly available. I am now giving careful consideration to the findings and recommendations of that report and I will be submitting my proposals for consideration by Government shortly.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and the Department of Defence maintain regular contact in relation to proposals concerning the possible use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Irish Aviation Authority approval, I should add that section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, excludes aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence from that authority's regulatory remit. Without prejudice to the Government's consideration of the possible expanded use of Baldonnel, I believe that section 3 of the 1993 Act should be amended in order to permit the authority to regulate any civil aviation activities at the military aerodromes which the Minister for Defence and <Col N="994" /> I may agree on. In this regard, I propose to include an appropriate amending clause in the Bill to establish the aviation regulator which I will be seeking Government approval to publish in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a new runway currently under construction at Dublin airport. The noise the Deputy is referring to may be emanating as a consequence of works being carried out on a rapid exit taxiway from the main runway at the airport. The construction of this taxiway, which is an essential element of the on-going infrastructural improvements at the airport, requires closure of the main runway at night and the consequential exclusive use of the secondary runway. This means that more aircraft overfly built up areas than would otherwise be the case and I am aware of the concerns of residents in north Dublin of the resulting aircraft noise.</P>
      <P>Work on the rapid exit taxiway is scheduled for completion in early April. Aer Rianta assures me that every effort is being made to complete the works as soon as possible, subject to the constraints of weather and operational delays. I assure the Deputy that the regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are those which have been promulgated at European Union level.</P>
      <P>As regards noise monitoring and abatement measures, I am advised by Aer Rianta that it has commissioned a consultancy study which will propose a noise management strategy, including provision of noise monitoring at Dublin Airport. I understand this study is expected to be completed by the middle of this year. I welcome this initiative by Aer Rianta who inform me that they will continue to encourage all measures to minimise noise impact where practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of information requested by the Deputy is not currently available.</P>
      <P>However, the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published last September provided for a major expansion of the budget, staffing and programmes of the Irish Energy Centre. In this context, the centre will develop programmes and systems to collect and analyse the level of data referred to in the Deputy's question, and establish benchmarks and targets for individual organisations within the public sector.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper recognises the potential for greater energy efficiency and consequent COf8&gt;2 emission savings in the public sector. Chapter 5 points out the lack of coherence in the State promoting energy efficiency in other sectors if it does not maximise its own efforts in this regard. For example, Departments and agencies will be required to establish, monitor and report in their annual reports on progress towards achieving obligatory energy savings.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that non-commercial public service buildings alone have an energy usage of at least £130 million per annum, representing COf8&gt;2 emissions of 2.5 million tonnes approximately. I am convinced that there is significant scope for savings, in the medium to long-term, of the order of 20% of the energy bill of public sector buildings. Therefore, I have asked the Irish Energy Centre to report to me on potential measures to achieve such savings and have already provided £10 million in the Green Paper towards the implementation of these measures.</P>
      <P>There are a number of existing measures already in place. For example, a building energy management system has been installed and commissioned in 40 public buildings on a pilot basis. It has met the expectations established and has contributed to the identification of significant energy savings.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper also recognises the role of local energy agencies in promoting energy efficiency at local government level. In following up on this recognition, I have undertaken a joint initiative with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to strongly encourage local authorities to establish such agencies under the EU SAVE Programme, and to re-inforce their support for such agencies where they already exist. The initiative also provides for the long-term funding of local energy agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my consoli<Col N="996" /> dated reply to several Private Notice Questions on 22 February, on receiving the three reports on Sellafield published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) on 18 February, I immediately wrote to UK Energy Minister, Ms Helen Liddell and the UK Environment Minister, Mr. Michael Meacher. I also requested the RPII to meet with the NII's chief inspector to explore with him his thinking in allowing operations at Sellafield to continue for two months, while the safety problems revealed in the reports were being addressed by BNFL.</P>
      <P>The RPII met with the NII's chief inspector on 22 February. At that meeting, the RPII pressed the chief inspector on this issue. In response, the chief inspector insisted that current operations at Sellafield were safe, but emphasised that if BNFL does not take the steps demanded of it in the NII reports the NII will use whatever enforcement measures are necessary.</P>
      <P>I subsequently met the Minister Ms Liddell in London on 1 March. At that meeting, I re-iterated the Government's demand that the Sellafield reprocessing plant be closed immediately. In response, Ms Liddell argued that the safe operation of the plant had not been called into question. Nevertheless, she said that a root and branch shake-up was taking place within BNFL to deal with the problems identified in the NII reports. I pointed out to her that the only satisfactory outcome for the Irish public would be closure of the plant.</P>
      <P>I also informed Ms Liddell of the Irish Government's intention to re-examine the issue of litigation against Sellafield in light of the NII reports. The Attorney General is following up on this examination at present.</P>
      <P>The NII reports represent a damning indictment of safety management and procedures at the Sellafield plant. These reports undoubtedly call into question the credibility of BNFL and the whole future of the Sellafield operations. In line with the Taoiseach's recent statements to the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, the Government will continue to exert maximum pressure on the UK to bring about closure of the plant.</P>

      <P>A number of approaches have been made in recent times by private concerns regarding the possible commercial use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may <Col N="997" /> have implications regarding licensing of the facility for such use. However, the greater utilisation of this under used resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with myself in the context of overall airports policy generally.

      <P>The social butter scheme, which was fully fundable by the EU, was one of a number of measures used to contribute to balance in the EU dairy market. Ireland was the only member state which operated it. The aid level was progressively reduced from year to year and a decision was taken by the EU Agriculture Council in December 1998 to allow the scheme to operate for one final year. The new basic Council regulation governing the EU dairy regime as agreed under Agenda 2000 did not provide for this scheme beyond January 2000. There is, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the east Offaly project was to research the possible role of badgers in the spread of TB amongst the bovine population. My Department under licences approved by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands removed a number of badgers so as to compare the effect of that removal on the level of TB in the associated cattle population with the level of TB in cattle in a surrounding control area. Since this project commenced in 1989, some 2,100 badgers have been removed for research purposes. The number of bovine reactors disclosed at tuberculin tests in the east Offaly project area dropped from 362 in 1989 to 30 in 1995, a reduction of 92%. Since 1995, the level of reactor removal has continued to remain low and the incidence of the disease is amongst the lowest in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department decided to carry out similar trials in other areas to determine if a similar <Col N="999" /> effect would be observed in areas of different geographical composition and with a variety of alternative farm enterprises. In 1997 the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands approved the issue of licences to remove badgers in four other experimental project areas, namely parts of Donegal, Kilkenny, north Cork and Monaghan. To date, this has resulted in some 1,600 badgers being removed from these areas and the latest research has revealed that some 21% of the badgers removed were subsequently identified as having TB.</P>
    <P>Analysis of data in these four project areas has not yet been completed as the effect of the disease prevalence in the cattle population in these areas will not be known until sometime after the removal phase.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed as part of the measures to be adopted, with the objective of reducing current levels of TB by 50% to undertake further research in the area of wildlife infection by taking a more pro active approach with a view to the removal of all sources of infection in the 20% of the country which yields some 50% of current TB reactors. I will be arranging for the finalisation of these measures with the farming and veterinary bodies in the context of the Animal Health Forum.</P>

      <P>The REP scheme was amended on 10 December 1997 to include certain control measures in relation to the eligibility of commonage land. Payment on leased commonage land was no longer permitted under the scheme. Intending participants with owned commonage had to be farming a minimum of ten acres, four hectares, of privately held land, either owned or leased, to qualify for participation in the REP scheme.</P>
      <P>The decision to introduce these changes was taken as a result of the submission of a significant number of REPS applications containing up to 100% leased commonage in order to qualify for or increase REPS payments.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a notice of preliminary tax for 1998-99 issued to the taxpayer in October 1998. The notice issued in the normal course as the taxpayer had made a <Col N="1002" /> return for the previous year which showed that he was in receipt of rental income. On 21 October 1998, the taxpayer paid £250 preliminary tax.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes has now established that the taxpayer's level of rental income is such that he does not have an income tax liability. The inspector will, therefore, treat the taxpayer as not liable to income tax for 1998-99 and following years. The tax office records have been noted accordingly and arrangements are being made to refund the preliminary tax which the taxpayer has paid.</P>
      <P>While the taxpayer is not liable to pay income tax, he is liable to pay PRSI. In cases where a self-assessment taxpayer has no income tax liability but is liable to pay PRSI, the PRSI payments are made directly to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The inspector of taxes has written to the taxpayer informing him that he is being treated as not liable to income tax and advising him that he should pay any PRSI contributions due to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in Waterford has been advised of the position in relation to the taxpayer.</P>

There is provision for a clawback of the exemption in certain circumstances, for example, where a beneficiary who is under 55 years of age at the date of the gift or inheritance ceases to own or reside in the house within the six year period following the gift or inheritance, but section 151(5) and (6) provide that no clawback will result where the clawback event is in consequence of the donee or successor requiring long &ndash; term medical care in a hospital, nursing home or convalescent home.</P>

Medical bibs used on the advice of a practitioner would, in general, be considered to be appliances for the purposes of section 469. The full extent of the costs allowable would depend on the individual case.</P>
      <P>Medical expenses are allowable for tax relief purposes only where they are not otherwise recoverable from any public or local authority, under any contract of insurance, or by way of compensation. Additionally, only expenses in excess of £100 for an individual or £200 where a claim is made in respect of two or more persons are allowable for the purposes of section 469.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to earlier questions on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced on budget day last year that additional funding would be made available from 1 January 2000 to support the application of the domiciliary care allowance scheme, introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973, to eligible children under two years of age.</P>
      <P>This modification to the scheme was confined to the age eligibility criterion only. All health boards have been notified of this modification. I am assured that they are implementing the domiciliary care allowance scheme, including the 1999 modification. Other criteria, as outlined in Circular No. 24/73, have not been altered. It should be noted that the circular points out, <i>inter alia, </i>that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance . . . It is not intended that the Scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. It is not visualised that any particular condition <Col N="1006" /> should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits. . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The views of the health board chief executive officers and their senior area medical officers have already been sought on the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The construction of the new accident and emergency department in the Mater Hospital is part of the Mater-Temple Street redevelopment programme which was announced in November 1999. This project will be carried out in two phases and the design, construction, equipping and commissioning of the project will take place over the life of the National Development Plan 2000-2007. Phase 1 of this development will encompass the following new adult facilities at the Mater Hospital: A&amp;E department, surgical department-intensive care unit, central sterile supplies department, outpatient-day services department and theatres. Facilities for the new national heart-lung transplant programme will also be included in this phase. The second phase of the project will incorporate all the Children's Hospital facilities along with joint service departments such as: catering, pharmacy, pathology and central supplies/maintenance workshop. Planning for the entire site is currently under way and it is envisaged that the new A&amp;E department at the Mater Hospital will open in four to five years.</P>
      <P>The briefs for both the Mater Hospital and The Children's Hospital, Temple Street are currently being reviewed and amalgamated by an external Consultant. In the original Mater Hospital brief, provision was made that one of the treatment rooms be used as a secure area for prisoners. A four bedded room was also planned for potentially disruptive patients. It is envisaged that the new development plans will include similar facilities.</P>

      <P>Eighteen deaths from bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, were notified to my Department by the health boards in 1999. In 2000, ten such deaths have been reported up to the end of February.</P>
      <P>The working group on bacterial meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer and which published reports in 1997 and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research, at national and international level so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
      <P>In recent years surveillance systems in relation to meningitis have been significantly improved. Health boards are required to notify details of cases to my Department within 24 hours of them occurring and these arrangements are operating effectively. My Department has also funded the establishment of the meningococcal reference laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, and the diagnostic service provided by this laboratory has had a significant impact on case ascertainment and confirmation of the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease. The meningococcal reference laboratory is also undertaking a study to establish the sub-strains of group C meningococcal disease circulating in Ireland as part of the preparations for the introduction of a new vaccine against this strain of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will <Col N="1009" /> assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in recent years research has been undertaken in Ireland on a range of issues in elation to this disease, including whether particular sub-groups within the population may be at particular risk of contracting meningococcal infection, the question of genetic susceptibility to infection, the early management of the acute condition and on the follow-up of surviving children.</P>

      <P>The licensing of landfill facilities is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, which is required,<i> inter alia,</i> to specify the quantity of waste permitted to be disposed of in each such facility. The agency is independent in the exercise of its licensing function; the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is statutorily precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the agency of its functions under the 1996 Act. Accordingly, the question of allowing a local authority to act other than in compliance with a waste licence could not arise.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September during which approved students will be allowed to undertake 2,000 hours work at £3 per hour, giving a possible total maximum payment of £600. The scheme will be advertised shortly in the national newspapers.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the scheme is to provide an income and work experience to less well off third level students who are unable to obtain employment during the summer months. Demand for the scheme has dropped off significantly over the past few years. This obviously reflects the wider availability of jobs especially in the tourism and services sectors and is a welcome trend.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to increase the rate of pay under the scheme this year. An increase in the rate of pay might encourage highly employable students to leave the mainstream labour supply. It would be inadvisable to do this in a tightening labour market situation even for short periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The group of people referred to by the Deputy are in receipt of reduced rate pensions equating to 50% and 75% of the standard, maximum old age contributory pension rate. These rates of payment are based on their yearly averages of between ten and 19 contributions. Such people benefited under the measure which I introduced in November 1997 which provided for a reduction in the yearly average from 20 to ten, thereby extending contributory pensions coverage to a significant number of people who would otherwise have failed to qualify.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 2000, proposes two distinct measures in relation to the old age contributory and retirement pensions schemes. Firstly, it is proposed to introduce a special measure in relation to certain people with social insurance contributions paid prior to the introduction of the unified system of social insurance in 1953. While such contributions may, at present, be used to satisfy two of the three qualifying contribution conditions for the old age contributory pension, they cannot be used for the yearly average test as they contain no pension element.</P>
      <P>As a result, some people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 failed to qualify for this pension due to the operation of the &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test. This Bill, therefore, provides for the introduction, from next May, of a special, flat rate old age contributory pension to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50%, i.e. £48 per week from May, of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid, at least, 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post-1953 insurance. Thus, for, example, a person with six years social insurance paid prior to 1953 will have 468 contributions accredited under the three for two rule.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the introduction of this special flat rate pension will confer no additional advantage to the group of people referred to above as their pension rates from next May, will equal or exceed the new 50% flat rate pension, i.e. £48.00 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second point raised by the Deputy, namely the replacement of three of the reduced rates bands under the old age contributory and retirement pensions schemes by a new 98% rate which equates to £94.10 per week, I can also confirm that this will not affect those pen<Col N="1014" /> sioners whose yearly averages are below 20 and who did not qualify under the standard qualifying conditions.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The spouse or partner of the passholder may accompany the passholder free of charge when travelling.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department is nearing completion and will be published shortly by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, in the Trinity Studies in Public Policy series. The issue raised by the Deputy is examined in the review.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the review findings, I announced two specific measures in Budget 2000. There are the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition and the extension of the free electricity allowance and free television licence to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000 at an estimated full year cost of £6 million. I will consider further measures when I examine the final report in the context of future budgetary policy.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of <Col N="1015" /> my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. The primary purpose of the scheme is to encourage people who have been long-term unemployed to test employment or self-employment options and regain a foothold in the labour market while retaining some financial security for a year or four year period.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to facilitate potential recipients who are interested in the self-employment option in every way possible. Such applicants are encouraged to carry out any preparatory work e.g. business planning, market research, training, registration for tax, preparation of accounts, etc., before beginning work. The purpose of this is to ensure that when they commence participation in the scheme they will be in a position to begin trading immediately, having already completed all the necessary preparatory work. This will enable them to maximise the period of financial support available under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In order to reach those who have not worked for a long time, my Department will shortly introduce a supplementary back to work allowance scheme for the very long-term unemployed. In addition to the normal benefits of the back to work allowance this will allow employees to undergo a period of training with a potential employer for six weeks prior to actually working. An allowance of £35 per week will be paid to employees during that time in addition to their normal unemployment payment. Following this period they can progress onto the normal back to work scheme for three years.</P>
      <P>FÁS also operates a &ldquo;Work Place&rdquo; work experience programme. This provides up to five weeks placement with employers in the private and public sector and it is targeted at persons who are six months or more on the live register.</P>

      <P>In July 1999 my Department advertised a proposal to extend the Sandymount Strand-Tolka Estuary special protection area. I am advised that the area which Dublin Port wishes to infill, as part of the port development, is not important for birds so no part of it has been included in the SPA extension, as indicated by the definitive map in the statutory instrument. This involved a small adjustment of the boundary as previously advertised.</P>
      <P>The majority of the proposed port extension area is covered by the sea at all times and is not regularly used by waterfowl. A small portion of this area is exposed at very low tides and when this occurs a number of common, adaptable wader species opportunistically exploit the exposed invertebrate food resource there. As this inter-tidal area is very small, extensive inter-tidal mud and sandflats are available nearby in Dublin Bay and the food resource is available to the birds only very briefly, at low spring tides, no bird species have any dependence on this area. Accordingly, from a bird conservation viewpoint, my Department has no objection to Dublin Port infilling the area.</P>

      <P>Of the 2,889 prisoners in custody on Monday 20 March, there were 50 persons &ndash; approximately 1.7% of the prison population <Col N="1017" />&ndash; who, on committal, had given their address as no fixed abode. Experience has, however, shown that many prisoners who were effectively homeless prior to committal will deny their homeless status or will assert that accommodation is available to them upon release so as not to prejudice their prospects for early release. The 1996 survey of Mountjoy prisoners commissioned by the Department from Dr. Paul O'Mahony recorded that 8% of the prisoners he interviewed were homeless on committal. This was more than double the 3% figure for this category in Dr. O'Mahony's previous survey in 1986.</P>
      <P>Prisoners who are known to be homeless are not granted early release. Every effort is made to provide them with some form of accommodation where possible on completion of their sentence(s).</P>
      <P>Two categories of prisoner experience particularly high levels of difficulty in being rehoused following release. These are sex offenders and drug related offenders. Women offenders convicted of drug related offences or in dependant relationships with persons in this category particularly suffer from homelessness subsequent to release from prison, according to prison staff.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service implements programmes of supervised temporary release in the cases of those prisoners whose early release is planned and who continue to serve the balance of their sentence in the community. In these cases the issues of accommodation and homelessness would be examined along with a number of other factors in the preparatory stages. Where a prisoner is unable to return to his/her family home, either because of the nature of the offence or for other reasons, efforts are made to relocate the offender upon release to a different part of the country or city as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service also works in close association with a number of voluntary community groups in the provision of accommodation for those released from custody or those under supervision in the community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 111 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, of the total of 752 schools at second level, 211 schools have disadvantaged status and <Col N="1020" /> have been invited to participate in the home school-community liaison scheme.</P>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16% of the school going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17% of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position of this school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home-school-community liaison schemes.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern being expressed regarding the drop off of second level students taking chemistry and physics for the leaving certificate; the plans, if any, he has to encourage these subjects in order that more students will be prepared to study these subjects at third level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the current trends in uptake of chemistry and physics in second level schools. One of the first official actions which I took as Minister for Education and Science was to launch a careers information pack which was aimed at drawing attention to the career opportunities which abound in science based sectors.</P>
      <P>The decline in participation rates in the physical sciences is a multifaceted problem. Curricular content, availability of laboratory equipment and practical work, examination papers, parental influence, peer pressure, perceptions regarding points, awareness of career options and career aspirations all impact on the uptake of a subject.</P>
      <P>The complex interplay of these factors will doubtless vary from school to school. It is also worth noting that the trend observed in the up-take of the physical sciences in Ireland is mirrored internationally. This issue was explored as part of the international colloquium on attainment in physics at age 16 plus, which was organised by the Department of Education and Science and held in Cork in September 1998. Consequently, intervention in a meaningful way to arrest the trends in up-take of the physical sciences represents a major challenge, not only to the Department of Education and Science and post-primary and third level sectors, but also to the industrial sector which depends on a well educated population in these subject areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the importance of physical sciences subjects in the context of our increasingly technological society and acknowledging the complex nature of the problem, my Department's current initiative, costing £15 million over three <Col N="1021" /> years, addresses many of the factors listed above. Under this initiative the following have been put in place. A major programme of investment in modernising school science laboratories is being implemented. The use of information and communication technologies in the teaching of chemistry and physics is seen as important in modernising the presentation of these subjects. Consequently, I have arranged for a special grant to be issued to schools shortly. A new payment for schools for each student undertaking physics or chemistry was introduced this year. Costing more than £300,000 in a full year, this involves providing schools with £10 for each student to aid in the purchase of materials for these classes. New syllabi in leaving certificate physics and in chemistry have been issued to schools in December 1999 and the new syllabi will be introduced in September 2000 and examined in June 2002. The content of these syllabi includes a 30% weighting in the area of science, technology and society which will increase awareness of the relevance of these subjects in everyday life. There is an increased emphasis on practical work and new topics such as particle physics and industrial and environmental chemistry are included.</P>
    <P>The NCCA is currently undertaking a review of the junior certificate science syllabus, particularly in respect of the physics and chemistry content of the syllabus. Work to improve the structure and layout of questions in the leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry ordinary level papers is ongoing. A number of changes were implemented last year. Circular letters and exemplar questions to support a continuation of this work have been issued to schools in December 1999.</P>
    <P>A new examination paper format for the junior certificate science examination at ordinary level is being introduced this June 2000. This change was notified to schools in December 1999. An extensive in-career development initiative for teachers of physics and chemistry at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels has been launched. A panel of trainers was appointed last September to support this initiative. The initiative will consist of comprehensive programmes which will emphasise modern developments in teaching methods, including the role of practical work, in relation to these subjects. Each of the country's 900 teachers of physics and 1,000 teachers of chemistry has had the opportunity of attending one and a half day's in-service training this school year. By the end of April they will each have received another day's in-service in chemistry and in physics in preparation for the introduction of the new syllabi in September. The trainers will also provide ongoing support for teachers of these subjects over a three-year period. I also intend providing copies of the resource handbooks in physics and in chemistry, which were developed under the schools intervention project and supported under the gender equity programme, to all schools, both in book form and on <Col N="1022" /> CD-ROM. A one-week residential training course for teachers of physics and of chemistry was held at the University of Limerick in July 1999 to develop and extend the skills base that currently exists in the area of delivery of in-service training to teachers in the physical sciences. Fifty teachers were in attendance and many of these teachers are now available to deliver in-service at a local and national level.</P>
    <P>A video and CD entitled Careers in Science, produced by FÁS with the support of the chemical and allied products group, which I launched in February, is specifically aimed at identifying the career opportunities available to students of the sciences, particularly chemistry. Officials of my Department assisted in the preparation of this material and in distributing it to all school principals, chemistry teachers and guidance counsellors.</P>
    <P>A special working group was set up by the Royal Irish Academy last autumn to consider approaches for tackling the problem of declining popularity of chemistry and physics. Particular consideration was given to the possible initiatives that the third level sector might undertake to support developments at second level. I am at present studying the findings and recommendations of this group.</P>

      <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to cover all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were also advised that they could seek remedial support where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>All available posts were utilised in the current school year to extend the service to those schools which previously had no remedial teacher service. The school to which the Deputy refers has a shared remedial teacher post.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that I have noted the situation to which she refers and that the remedial needs of the school in question will be fully taken into account in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this decision, such children can now be provided for in dedicated classes within the primary system. All such classes operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and have child care assistant support. To date, more than 50 such classes have been established to cater for children with autism and further classes will be established in response to identified need. These classes operate for the duration of the normal primary school year of 183 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CABAS project to which the Deputy refers is a pilot initiative which was established in July 1999 to cater for up to 12 children who have <Col N="1024" /> been assessed as autistic and who range in age from four to six years. The CABAS project, which follows the principles of applied behaviour analysis, has been established for a five year pilot period. This pilot project does not have to operate within the normal primary school year of 183 days. The operation of this pilot project is being monitored and its effectiveness will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. The question of further expansion of the applied behaviour analysis approach, including the extended school year involved, will be considered in the light of the outcome of the evaluation of the CABAS project.</P>
