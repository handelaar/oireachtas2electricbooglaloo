      <P>I attended the inaugural summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in London on Friday, 17 December last. I was accompanied by my colleagues, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Prime Minister and I welcomed the establishment of the British-Irish Council which will enhance the excellent working relationship that our two Governments have long enjoyed. The council is particularly relevant in the context of the extensive devolution which has taken place in the UK and will allow us develop stronger links with the recently devolved administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh. I am circulating in the Official Report the communiqué which issued after the meeting.</P>
      <P>At the meeting we agreed a number of issues for early consideration by the council, including drugs, social inclusion, the environment, transport and the knowledge economy. These issues are of particular importance and concern and I look forward to the benefits of this type of co-operation. We also agreed an indicative list of other issues which would be appropriate to the council's work. On the same day I attended the inaugural meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in 10 Downing Street. The same Ministers who attended the British-Irish Council accompanied me. The conference will play an important role in promoting bilateral co-operation across the totality of relationships but with a strong focus on non-devolved Northern Ireland matters. At the meeting we agreed a programme of work around two initial lists of issues which are set out in a communiqué which will be circulated in the Official report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding my meeting with the British Prime Minister in Helsinki, I refer Deputies to my statement to this House on 15 December. It was a source of great satisfaction to me that we have achieved the implementation of the institutional aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. The establishment of the new Executive in Northern Ireland was a significant achievement and the initiation of the North-South Ministerial Council represented an important milestone in our island's history. Since the inaugural meeting, there has been significant progress in the North-South Ministerial Council framework. I am circulating in the Official Report a communiqué issued on 24 January following the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in sectoral format, dealing with the Trade and Business Development Body. In addition, meetings in the following sectoral formats are envisaged over the <Col N="692" /> next three and a half weeks &ndash; Education, Health, the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and special EU programmes. A schedule of further sectoral ministerial council meetings is being prepared and it has been envisaged that a first council meeting in all the sectoral formats agreed to date will have taken place by March and that they would meet quarterly thereafter. A first meeting of the council in institutional format is envisaged for March.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, on the implementation of the Patten report. The Irish Government has always maintained that early and effective implementation of the report's recommendations would form an essential aspect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole. In this regard, it is very encouraging that the British Government has accepted and is to act on the great majority of the proposals. I recognise there are those who have difficulties with some of the changes being proposed, but we now have a unique opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland. The measures announced by the Secretary of State, when completed satisfactorily through legislation, will ensure a police service which is capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole. I hope Nationalists will then apply in great numbers to join the new police service of Northern Ireland. I look forward to seeing a detailed implementation plan emerge in the coming weeks and early publication of the necessary legislation which must be fully in line with the thrust and spirit of the Patten recommendations.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 20 January, I met First Minister David Trimble. We had a useful discussion on matters relating to the Patten report and decommissioning. Before and since then, I have been in continuous contact with the British Prime Minister and parties in Northern Ireland, including a meeting with a senior SDLP delegation on Friday last, 28 January. There are no current plans for me to visit Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to decommissioning, the Independent International Commission supplied a further progress report to the two Governments in the early hours of this morning but it has not yet been published. The report is now being studied and intensive contacts and discussions on the issue are continuing. It is clear that we are now at a crucial stage in regard to the consolidation and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is vital that all the participants involved consider the next steps with the utmost care and deliberation. Having regard to the circumstances, I am not in a position to elaborate further at this time. I regret that I cannot give the House more information but I know Deputies will understand the position and the need for further consultation with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although plans are at a tentative stage, I can confirm that I will be visiting Australia and the <Col N="693" /> United States in the week around St. Patrick's Day this year. My Department is engaged in advancing the necessary arrangements and in putting together an itinerary for the visits in close association with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassies concerned.</P>

      </i>The British-Irish Council established under the Good Friday Agreement held its inaugural summit meeting today in London. The British and Irish Governments were represented by the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair MP, who also chaired the meeting and by the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern TD.</P>
    <P>The devolved administrations were represented by The Rt. Hon. Donald Dewar MP, MSP, First Minister, Scottish Executive; The Rt. Hon. Alun Michael, JP, MP, AM, First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales; The Rt. Hon. David Trimble MP, MLA First Minister, and Mr. Seamus Mallon, MP, MLA, Deputy First Minister, Northern Ireland Executive Committee.</P>
    <P>The Isle of Man was represented by Hon. Donald Gelling MHK, Chief Minister of the Isle of Man Government; Jersey was represented by Senator Pierre Horsfall, President of the States of Jersey Policy and Resources Committee; and Guernsey was represented by Conseiller Laurie Morgan, President of the States of Guernsey Advisory and Finance Committee.</P>
    <P>A full list of delegation members is attached.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Council will be a forum for its members to exchange information, discuss, consult and endeavour to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest within their respective competencies.</P>
    <P>The members of the Council were agreed that its establishment was an important step in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and would serve to promote the further development of the network of relationships between the peoples they represent. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister expressed their confidence that the Council would build on the excellent working relationship which the two Governments have long enjoyed. The establishment of the British-Irish Council was particularly appropriate now, in view of the opportunities presented both by the new environment created by the Good Friday Agreement, and the advent of extensive devolution in the UK.</P>
    <P>At its first meeting the Council agreed a Memorandum on its working procedures. It adopted an initial list of issues for early discussion in the BIC and also decided which administrations would take the lead in each sectoral area:</P>

    <P>Mr. Quinn: I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. Does he agree that in the eight short weeks since the Executive was established it has carried out its functions particularly well, bearing in mind the legacy it had to overcome? Does he share with me the view that every effort should be made by all concerned to ensure the continued existence of the Executive within the framework of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland and the changed constitutional structure that is now the United Kingdom? Does he further agree that in the most recent MRBI opinion poll published in <i>The Irish Times</i> the majority of the Irish people are committed to the process of decommissioning and want it to take place sooner rather than later?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the Christmas period, in the recent short period there was enormous commitment by all the parties to setting up the institutions, working in the committees and having meaningful agendas. Mr. Empey, in particular, moved very quickly last week to put in place the structures of the business development body. He could have taken longer to get it moving but he did not. It was a very substantive agenda. The reports were well publicised and I will circulate details of them. That is an example of the commitment to getting the structures up and running and setting up the board and the other meetings.</P>
      <P>Mr. Trimble, Mr. McGuinness and all Members of the Executive, particularly the Deputy First Minister, have been driving on the format at meetings. I circulated some of the data on the format. Work on this could not have been speedier. Over the Christmas period I thought the pace would wane a little in January, but that has not been the case. I am very satisfied with the progress made.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, it would be a disaster, to put it at its mildest, if any of the institutions were to slide. People have to think very hard. It is easy to take stands but they must realise the consequences of them. This is an extremely delicate period and people must be conscious of that. In the Dáil, as in the opinion poll the Deputy mentioned, I recognise there is enormous support for the institutions. They have the potential to do most of what people want done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have implemented an enormous amount of the Good Friday Agreement. In the last calendar <Col N="698" /> year we probably implemented far more of the Agreement than people expected, if they were half honest. We have started this year with an enormous potential. There were those who thought the Patten report would not move on to a path that would facilitate a clear mechanism for its implementation, but that has been set down in legislative and other structures. All these matters will be followed through.</P>
    <P>I have had no discussions with the British Prime Minister where I am not absolutely satisfied about his commitment to ensuring the institutions and all issues around them are handled safely, provided there is full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The House is aware we still have some difficulties with the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. Am I correct in understanding the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will meet later this afternoon and following the outcome of that meeting the two Governments will consult each other before any decision is made as to how they wish to respond to the report from General de Chastelain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of discussions are going on. The Deputy is correct in respect of the first part of his question. A meeting will take place at 4.30 p.m. Prior to that meeting I will have a discussion with the British Prime Minister at 3.30 p.m. There will be further discussions between the Prime Minister and me, the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with some of the parties. There is also contact between my officials and other parties. As to whether this issue can be resolved to any satisfactory degree today or will take more time, it may take more time. This level of contact and pressure back and forth has continued, particularly over the past four or five days. Obviously, if that is ongoing, we have not yet found full resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that putting beyond use, bombs and guns held by organisations which are associated with political parties who are serving in Government is not a partisan issue of concern to one or two political parties but a fundamental requirement for the normal functioning of Government and the normal sense of equality between Ministers that they <Col N="699" /> are all working with the same political mandate? Does the Taoiseach agree that putting beyond use bombs and guns held by organisations associated with political parties serving in Government is important in itself, but is even more important in that it is the only available means of establishing the long-term intentions of the organisation concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I agree with him. Notwithstanding all the arguments about timing, convincing and persuasion, of which all Members are aware, at the end of the day it is still a fundamental question. It was for this reason after Hillsborough in Holy Week last year, when it was not possible to reach agreement on the act of reconciliation which would have involved everyone participating in decommissioning, that I argued strongly that we should try to get agreement on three basic principles.</P>
      <P>The three basic principles on which we got agreement on 25 June were, first, that there would be an inclusive Executive with devolved powers; second, that the mechanism to deal with decommissioning would be established under the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning under General John de Chastelain and the legislation passed earlier by the Oireachtas and in Westminster; and, third, that decommissioning would be dealt with by May 2000 as per the Good Friday Agreement. I have not moved from that position.</P>
      <P>While I did not like what Mr. Trimble did in November on the morning of his party's conference, when he forwarded an amendment to his conference without any notification to anybody although he had previously agreed in the review to the mechanism of bringing the institutions and the constitutional issues to a finality, he did so because he felt there was a political imperative to ensure he carried his conference. I understood that position. Notwithstanding this, I have argued strongly, with considerable success, for the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton said, this means the decommissioning issue must be dealt with so everybody knows where they stand as we move forward in democratic politics, working on the basis of trust and that, however horrific, the past is the past and it can be resolved. Last night was one of the benchmarks in moving that issue on further and trying to get at least &ndash; although at least is unsatisfactory &ndash; a clear indication of where we are going on the path to achieving it. I am committed to achieving our objective, but we have hit very difficult times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's comments but I am not at all surprised by his positive answer to my two questions because he has always been consistent on this matter. Does the Taoiseach further agree, bearing in mind the issues to which he has already agreed, that it is <Col N="700" /> fundamental the IRA and Sinn Féin realise that the notion of a gesture of decommissioning was only invented in the first place as a political request because the organisation was unable or unwilling to say its ceasefire was permanent and that, in a sense, it was a substitute for such a statement? Would the Taoiseach further agree that, at this stage in the process, it is essential that the IRA state there is a definite timeframe which can be measured and understood within which it will ensure the arms and guns, which can be used to kill so many people, are a position in which they can ever be used again for that purpose to lever political change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct on the history of the position. I understand, though I do not agree, how the republican movement would like to deal with this issue in the longer term. I understand it has its own strategy for dealing with this issue, though it is not in the public domain, and was not said clearly to me either. I think I can read between the lines, as many others can, about how it would deal with decommissioning. It is imperative for implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to stick to the rules and framework laid down. Having been part of the negotiations through the multi-party talks and the talks between the Governments, I have to endeavour to be consistent in its implementation. While I will argue strenuously for the implementation of the Patten report, the equality agenda, the ombudsman, the police authority and the North Report on the Parades Commission, it will be understood that I have to argue equally for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on the other side. That is not a weakness, that is consistency. I would like people to note that I can only be successful if I play fair. In this instance, as Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn said here many times, it is not so much and it never was a matter of giving up ten guns, ten bullets, ten flares, or ten jackets as that does not exactly get us anywhere, given that one can go out and replace them the following day&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of places in which to buy them, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;particularly if time and resources do not seem to be a problem. That does not really get us anywhere. The key is what we achieved on 25 June, that decommissioning will be dealt with under the independent international commission comprising some eminent people, by May 2000. There have been some arguments around that but I do not want to get into them and I have not. I heard what people said before, but I have consistently said May 2000. What is important now is the knowledge of the commitment so that I can truthfully say that I know this issue will be dealt with in whatever way brings certainty. That is the issue. I do not go with the issue of a bullet or a gun. The issue is one of commitment, the certainty of the commitment. I <Col N="701" /> would not even get strung up on the dates but I have always stated the date that I think has to be adhered to, the consistent date. Moving from one date can get us into all kinds of problems, but May 2000 is the date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night was a step forward, and these deliberations which are taking place now are a step to move towards that date. It cannot be anything else because otherwise we would have an enormous amount of confusion.  The House would appreciate that one must be clear about it because it is an international, national and domestic issue. Perhaps there are some things which one can fudge, but one cannot fudge an issue which is based on a fundamental principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, in addition to the urgency of seeing some clear evidence that weapons are being put beyond use, it is important that any statements which are made do not simply describe the current situation or current intentions but give a clear commitment as to future intentions, commitments and actions; that part of the problem in interpreting statements which have been made in the past have been concerned with the tense which has been used, that the present tense has been used where the future tense should have been used; that as a result of people seeing the right words but not seeing the tense of the verb in the sentence, people have tended to put a more optimistic gloss on statements which have been made by the republican movement than the words actually conveyed; and that it is very important that any statement, which is made by the republican movement to the extent that it deals with the future, is a firm one containing the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; rather than something which simply describes a current state of mind which could change tomorrow if something else changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, but normally it does what it says and perhaps dwells more over it. Perhaps sometimes others who are opposed to the republican movement continually focus on not the bigger picture but on the small step. The bigger picture is far more important, but I agree that any agreement or statement must be clear and unambiguous, particularly that which will come from the independent international commission. We must know that it is firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I know it is not the republican movement in the way it portrays the argument but Sinn Féin which has made clear its position <Col N="702" /> regarding decommissioning in the Good Friday Agreement, in the agreement of 25 June and on many other occasions. We must stick to what is being documented, and there has been a firm commitment throughout to May 2000. I know there have been many delays, there has been procrastination, and I am aware of the difficulties on many issues, but one still comes back to some fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>In these remarks I do not want to ignore that we have moved on a couple of years from the cessation of troubles, that the guns have been silent. An enormous amount of work has been done in the republican community to keep peace and stability, to stop punishment beatings and all those other matters. They are all very positive for the peace process, but there are still some outstanding issues and this is one of them.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to a number of headings under which items were discussed at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting of 17 December. Were marine and energy matters included, as they were not referred to in his reply? Were fish stocks in the Irish Sea and ageing nuclear installations in Britain discussed and were measures agreed?</P>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach is on record as expressing concern about the de Chastelain report, and the Green Party shares that concern. Is it difficult to imagine any other circumstances where a May Day impasse has been declared in February? Does the Taoiseach support the call for Senator Mitchell to return in those circumstances, given the seriousness of the breakdown of trust? Is he willing to adopt a more direct hands-on approach, as he did previously and as his predecesssor, Deputy Reynolds, did, to ensure the position is restored and institutions do not break down?</P>

      <P>As to the Deputy's first question, the longer list that I referred to covers about ten or 12 headings, and acquaculture, including salmon fisheries, is one of the issues mentioned in it. On the second matter, effectively since Christmas &ndash; with the exception of five days &ndash; I have been involved hands-on with this particular issue trying to find a way of satisfactorily moving on. Mid-February is a date that I would prefer not to have had, and it has turned into early February. The date is not helpful because it was not agreed but it is a reality. There are some things that one may not like but they are realities and we have to try to find a way of dealing with them. I would examine the possibility of doing anything that is meaningful or involving anybody who is agreeable. The important thing is to try to work together on this matter, although at times it is not always easy to do so. The deferment, disbandment, collapsing or setting aside of arrangements creates its own enormous problems and we have to try to find a resolution if we can.</P>

        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach agree that political parties on both sides of the divide in the North have been engaged in deliberate brinkmanship in recent weeks over some of the crucial questions in Northern Ireland and that it is extremely irresponsible in the circumstances? Would he agree that no self-appointed groups or political parties have the right to engage in this kind of brinkmanship or to adopt a stance on any of the main issues that could risk or hint at the risk of plunging Northern Ireland back into the nightmare of sectarian conflict? Would he further agree that no party has the right in any way to risk a resumption of the activities that would give rise to such suffering and dislocation, particularly in working class communities, as happened in the past 30 years?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that disturbing evidence is now emerging of the backward nature of a major plank of the Good Friday Agreement, which I pointed to in the debate in this House, which is that it tends to institutionalise sectarianism? Is he concerned that in recent days, issues have come up in the Assembly which are of importance to all the people in Northern Ireland, but have broken down along sectarian lines in votes and discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back to what I said to Deputy Quinn at the outset, in agreeing with him, that in fairness to the Assembly the institution is in its infancy. While there have been arguments and political debate, the progress has been immense. It has been constructive and I do not think it has been overly sectarian. It will take a long time to develop aspects of normality in political life in Northern Ireland, so that people will take a free line. I suppose that happens in all parliaments. In the early weeks of the Assembly it would be unfair to say otherwise, and equally unfair to say that the Good Friday Agreement had built-in sectarianism. It had balances to get away from that, and the position adopted was to avoid minority or majority blocs of a sectarian nature. I think that will work well in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned people being involved in brinkmanship but perhaps that is being uncharitable to them. People have deeply held positions and they have reasons for holding them. They have their own strategies and deeply held views, but the end result is that one can get oneself into a lot of trouble. We have achieved an enormous amount of compromise, but we tend to return to just a few issues which must be moved on also so that we can all reach an understanding. Of course, people can box themselves into corners at times. I am not here to criticise anyone for doing that &ndash; we can all run out of road. People must help each other to deal with that. We should stick to the basic principles. In this case, we are not exactly deal<Col N="704" /> ing with topics that have not been discussed before.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree one runs out of road much more quickly if one deliberately turns into a political cul-de-sac?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not disagree with that. It can be very dangerous to turn into a cul-de-sac.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the issue here is that the paramilitary organisations have deeply held positions. However, does he agree that the paramilitary organisations, both loyalist and republican, are deeply ideological movements, in that they construct an internal logic that justifies their position? Does he agree the Good Friday Agreement has removed the ideological basis for the maintenance of armaments by loyalists and republicans, in that, as far as loyalists are concerned, under the Good Friday Agreement, as endorsed by all the Irish people, the future of Northern Ireland, constitutionally speaking, can only be determined with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland? There is not an ideological basis for the maintenance of loyalist armouries. Equally, the Good Friday Agreement has removed all ideological justification for the maintenance of the IRA, in that the IRA's objective, which was all-Ireland self determination, was achieved in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement. An army that continues fighting after it has achieved its fundamental objective is not behaving consistently or rationally. Furthermore, the Unionist community has accepted for the first time an agenda which involves complete internal equality for the two communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem for the republican movement is its chronic inability to recognise its own success. It is that inability which has, to use Deputy Joe Higgins' felicitous phrase, backed it into a <i>cul-de-sac. </i>If it would take another turning it would recognise there is a bright new road in front of it with no barriers.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the history of the situation does not help in the argument about decommissioning, both our own history and the more difficult recent history. However, it is true that if people on this small island are to work together this must be resolved; otherwise, the kind of armaments which are believed to exist will continue to be considered an immense threat. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>In the interests of balance, while the republican movement might have backed itself into a cul-de-sac, it engaged very fairly and actively in the review. The review had a number of aspects and a complicated set of mechanisms, one of which was broken which did not help matters. While I have accepted why that happened, the republican movement has not done so. That has to be considered in the equation. It is not something with which I agree.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement had many aspects, parts and difficulties, all of which have to be dealt with &ndash; there must be a conclusion to them all. There are still a few difficult ones. It is unreasonable not to give a clear indication as to where the resolution to a particular one lies. I am not on record in recent weeks stating it should all be delivered by 31 January &ndash; that was not realistic. It is, however, realistic to try to reach a resolution on how this issue can be dealt with so that people understand it and it will not continue to have a &ldquo;high noon&rdquo; every few weeks.</P>
      <P>The institutions are working well and the people are committed. As Deputy Quinn said, 85% of the people still support them. They are the important aspects. I appreciate the atmosphere in the House on this issue and I hope people can look at the bigger picture and that we do not push ourselves over a cliff on an issue which has been around for a long time and which needs to be clarified to the satisfaction of all of us, but immediately for two of the major players.

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, I put it to him that Ireland is united, North and South, in a clear desire that the decommissioning issue should be addressed. This has been borne out by opinion polls on both sides of the Border. I ask the Taoiseach to note the <Col N="706" /> changed circumstances in which we are dealing with the matter having regard to the fact that only four years ago, in reply to a parliamentary question, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, stated categorically that there was no way parties associated with paramilitary organisations could be participants in inclusive talks. The current urgency has been brought about by an understanding that certain events would take place during the month of January. Was the Taoiseach privy to this understanding or does he have anything to tell the House about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to that question. I do not know anything other than what has been said about the understanding. I was not privy to it other than what I said earlier, that I was privy to the fact that there was not meant to be a February meeting and that it was May. That was a very clear understanding. I stated previously why I understand those changes were made.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that shortly before this House met this afternoon, David Trimble called a press conference at which he said he thought it was inevitable that the Executive would be suspended and that that would be followed by a review. He seemed to suggest, in voicing that opinion, that he had prior consultation with the Secretary of State. Is the Taoiseach aware of that development and, if so, will he comment on it?</P>
      <P>Sometimes, because I can afford to do so, I tend to be somewhat more blunt than other Members of this House. That said, I do not necessarily expect the Taoiseach to reply to my next question. Would he agree that on this occasion no blame can be attached to the British or the Unionists &ndash; we all understand why David Trimble did what he did at that meeting &ndash; and that the sword of Damocles has inevitably fallen because of the failure not merely to hand over but to get rid of one ounce of semtex or one rusty bullet?</P>
      <P>I wish to draw to the attention of the Taoiseach a symbolic event which might lead to optimism in relation to the future. When the power-sharing Executive collapsed 25 years ago, a demonstration took place outside Stormont to demand the end of that Executive and the effective handing over of the Ministers to be hanged. On this occasion, as the future is being decided, a demonstration is also taking place outside Stormont but this one comprises farmers who are demanding that the SDLP Minister for Agriculture and the new Northern Ireland Executive take action about the plight of farmers in Northern Ireland. That is a change which is of great significance. While those of us involved with matters 25 years ago felt that the suspension&mdash;</P>

However, further understanding will be required on how that can be interpreted and agreed on the other side. If the question is &ndash; as it has been put on radio programmes in Northern Ireland in recent days &ndash; that the resolution of the decommissioning issue equals the surrender of product on 31 January, this will be difficult to achieve. It is in that sense that people can adjust their position.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Currie's final question, there is no doubt that the people of Northern Ireland are becoming increasingly positive about the Executive. More and more representations are being made about everyday issues and normal debates took place on education and health in recent days, which is a good development. I commented earlier on the matter to which the Deputy referred in his second question.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question about Mr. Trimble's comments earlier today, I do not consider that anything is inevitable.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy de Valera, is ill, so I am answering questions on her behalf. Thirteen professional archaeologists are assigned to the archaeological service of the Department and 17 archaeologists are engaged on a contract basis. None of these archaeologists is employed on a part-time basis. The Department also employs a small number of archaeologists on a seasonal basis as the need arises and further survey work is carried out from time to time by certain universities.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Dúchas dealt with 7,500 cases concerning planning and development issues where there were archaeological implications. This figure compares to just over 1,000 cases in 1992. This seven-fold increase is largely attributable to the upsurge in construction activity in the intervening period. In the past Dúchas managed this increased workload by a combination of employing additional archaeologists on a contract basis as well as the redeployment of staff from other areas of operation within the archaeological service. This placed additional strains on the resources at the Minister's disposal but she is satisfied that within the resources available an efficient and professional service has been maintained for all customers. In this regard, I point to the many archaeological sites which have been safeguarded and preserved over recent years through the intervention of the Department in the planning and development process. I also point to the co-operation and support we received from planning authorities and developers in recognising the need for the protection of the archaeological heritage as well as the general support from the public for the work carried out by the Department in this area.</P>
      <P>Safeguarding the archaeological heritage within the planning and development process is vitally important. However, it is too simplistic to equate success in this area with employing more archaeologists in the Department.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Other factors such as creating public awareness <Col N="709" /> of the heritage, access to information and localising the expertise available are also important ingredients. Great strides have been made by the Department is the past two decades, most notably through the work involved in presenting the premier heritage sites through the establishment of the record of monuments and places for the entire country, which gives immediate protection to 120,000 archaeological sites and monuments. However, more can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to see local authorities taking more of an interest in the management of their local heritage. Local authorities already possess a wide range of expertise within existing staff but, in the same way as they have planners to look after planning and engineers to look after roads, drainage, water services and so on, there is much to commend having archaeologists available to look after their archaeology. Notwithstanding the professional service provided centrally by the Department, there is potential to provide the service more effectively and efficiently by devolving the protection of archaeological sites within the planning process to planning authorities. Such a development would be consistent with the recently introduced procedures for the protection of the post-medieval architectural heritage. These procedures give primary responsibility for the management and protection of buildings contained in the record of protected structures to local authorities.</P>
    <P>A wider role for local authorities in the archaeological heritage should be further explored and the Minister intends to consider such a development in the context of the national heritage plan which she will publish later this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the Minister now presides over an absolute mess in so far as Dúchas is concerned? Is Dúchas in breach of the 1996 legislation? Is the Minister of State aware that on 17 January 2000, Dúchas wrote to the Minister indicating that it will not process excavation licences for six to eight weeks and that it will not have any further input into planning from 1 March 2000? This development means that valuable archaeological resources are, potentially, being decimated daily and there are delays in all kinds of construction projects involving buildings and roadways to the detriment of the development of the country.</P>

      <P>The first issue raised by the Deputy is the subject of another question. Planning applications are being dealt with and the Deputy will be aware that there are statutory limits on the processing of planning applications. The Department dealt with 7,500 applications which is a huge increase on previous years. The workload is increasing due to the large number <Col N="710" /> of infrastructural and other developments taking place. It is important that local authorities adopt a more hands-on approach. For example, it is important that more local authorities employ their own archaeologists so that they are in a position to make evaluations. It is very difficult to provide such services centrally given the significant growth in development. There are a number of solutions and acquiring their own local expertise, as some authorities have done, would be in line with the new thinking concerning local authorities. It is important that we do not delay projects and that the best archaeological advice is available at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>The financial allocations in the current financial year for the services provided under the aegis of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, come to £65.322 million, exclusive of administrative overheads which are included under the Department's administrative budget allocation. This figure provides for significantly increased spending on inland waterways reflecting the establishment of Waterways <Col N="711" /> Ireland, the cross-Border implementation body and on national monuments and historic properties.</P>
      <P>In determining these allocations which were set out in detail in the Abridged Estimates volume published in November 1999, the Minister's intention was to ensure that the ambitious programme of work to which Dúchas is committed is adequately resourced. In particular, I remind the Deputy that this year's level of capital expenditure of just under £31.5 million is the precursor to the implementation of a capital programme in excess of £200 million provided for in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>It is in the nature of the services for which Dúchas is responsible that demand will almost inevitably exceed available resources. However, within these constraints, significant progress has been made in recent years in restoring national monuments and historic properties, developing inland waterways and enhancing our wildlife service. The Minister intends to maintain the momentum of this activity in this and succeeding years.</P>

      <P>In light of various publications launched by the Minister such as the framework and principles for the protection of the archaeological heritage, the policy and guidelines on archaeological excavation and the strategy statement, will the Minister of State agree this places additional responsibilities on Dúchas with no contingent increase in staffing levels? The national development plan will result in a significant amount of infrastructural development. Last year the Department had well over 5,000 planning referrals and 1,000 licence applications but no licences have been issued since 17 January. Does the Minister of State agree this is a crisis which no excuses or soft talk will solve? Does he also agree that unless the Minister takes dramatic action the situation will become much worse and infrastructural development projects and resultant excavations will grind to a halt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wishes to ensure there are speedier procedures for planning so infrastructural developments can go ahead. There has also been an increase in the general allocation to Dúchas. Having been a Minister of State, the Deputy knows the reality is that there are complicated procedures to be followed in any increase in staff and that money is only one element of those procedures. The Deputy can be sure that the Minister will continue to try to get all sorts of resources to provide the optimum service. Dramatic results have been achieved and the increased number of planning applications dealt with last year is testament to the fact that, despite the unprecedented growth, Dúchas is dealing with the issues before it. However, there are pressures and everyone recognises those pressures.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is bland and lacks focus. What will the Department do about licences? If an important development goes ahead and the developer makes an application for licence to the Department, currently nothing happens and the development is held up. Equally with infrastructural development, there is a crisis to which there must be a response. The Minister is talking in generalised terms. What, exactly, will the Minister do to rectify a situation which could have a crippling effect on development, particularly infrastructural development?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>One way to avoid some of the difficulties faced at the moment would be if developers and their consultants were to prepare better and earlier designs for projects. This would help speed up many things. There is a focus that the total responsibility must rest with Dúchas, but all those involved, including local authorities and those planning projects, have an obligation to take matters of archaeology into account in the development of plans. That also goes for private developers.  There is a growing awareness of this problem and many people have a part to play. Dúchas has a part to play and resources will be required to ensure that the demands on the service are met. There are different ways to do this, which will not all be related to Dúchas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answering previous parliamentary questions on this subject, the Minister made it very clear that while her preference for an academy had been the Earlsfort Terrace location, the scope, the content, the standard of pedagogy and the ethos of the academy were the crucial issues and <Col N="713" /> should not be constrained by focusing first on a particular site or location.</P>
    <P>Issues in the debate on where the academy might be located have been informed in recent times by the production of two reports which were prepared at the behest of the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. These are the report of an interdepartmental working group, chaired by Mr. Noel Lindsay, and the report from Dr. Peter Renshaw of the London Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Both of these reports are in the Library of the House. The suitability of the Earlsfort Terrace site for the academy was considered in the course of all these deliberations. Resulting from Dr. Renshaw's report, however, the recommended option was to adopt a &ldquo;nodal&rdquo; approach for the academy on economic, educational and cultural grounds. The nodes recommended in the Renshaw report are those to be located in Dublin on a site in the DCU campus, at the Irish World Music Centre in the University of Limerick and at the Firkin Crane in Cork. This recommendation has been accepted.</P>
    <P>In this House on 3 June 1999, the Minister stated that the traditional model of a single location academy or <i>conservatoire </i>is being questioned, especially in a European context. The Minister went on to say that it is essential that we establish the correct model here. She is now satisfied, in the light of the extensive deliberations which have taken place, that the model of an academy concentrated in one location in one building would not be appropriate in the light of the most up-to-date and informed thinking on the role and functions of such an institution.</P>
    <P>The report produced by Dr. Renshaw drew on many sources and sectors in preparing the recommendations, including interviews with representatives of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Minister recently received a submission from Dublin Institute of Technology relating to the proposed academy of the performing arts. The Deputy is aware that the Minister for Education and Science recently announced the establishment of a planning and steering group to plan for the development of the academy. The Minister is referring the submission received from the Dublin Institute of Technology to this group which, as part of its work, will consult widely with interested parties. It will be open to all relevant bodies, including Trinity College, to make submissions to the group when it commences work. My Department will be represented on the group and will contribute to its deliberations on issues relating to the performing arts in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major concept which I support in principle. Does the Minister of State consider that the Minister is guilty of misleading the House on a number of occasions over the past 18 months, when she gave a clear indication that this academy would be sited in Earlsfort Terrace? Is it not a fact that the Lindsay report recom<Col N="714" /> mended clearly that the Earlsfort Terrace site was suitable? Will the Minister inform the House of the type and range of consultation carried out by Dr. Peter Renshaw and if it was adequate and appropriate to justify an expenditure of £35 million with significant revenue funding? Will the Minister outline the potential impact of the proposed academy for the performing arts on existing third level colleges of arts education, their courses, staffing, students, facilities and budgets? Why were the Dublin Institute of Technology, which has international credibility in this field, and Trinity College, Dublin, excluded from the observations made by Dr. Renshaw and accepted by the Minister?</P>

      <P>The Minister has no difficulty in stating that her preferred location for the academy was Earlsfort Terrace. That is well known. The Minister, however, was always of the view that the scope, content and standard in detail of the academy were the crucial issues and should not be constrained by focusing on a particular site or location. If it transpired that there were financial, legal or other insuperable reasons why Earlsfort Terrace was not viable, other options would have to be examined.</P>
      <P>In a reply on 9 March 1999, the Minister indicated that she was not opposed to Dublin City University or another location for the academy provided that the proper accommodation and resources could be satisfactorily provided. Following the detailed consideration given to the matter in the Renshaw report, this is now the preferred option of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be delighted that, rather than centralising this academy in one location, it is intended to decentralise it to three locations, two of which happen to be in Munster, the Deputy's own province. A fundamental decision has already been taken not to centralise this academy in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to nominations to the group mentioned by the Deputy, I am not in a position to give any undertaking on behalf of the Minister <Col N="715" /> but I will convey his thoughts on the matter to the Minister and I am sure she will consider them. As a general principle, both the Minister and I have made it very clear that institutions such as the academy of performing arts are for all the people and not merely some of them. I am sure the Minister will agree with the general principle of what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State happy that Dublin City University, a fine institution but one without a track record in the arts, has been chosen to be the headquarters of this academy?

      <P>Is there a long-term plan to acquire buildings which may have been offered for sale or which might be offered in the future? If buildings are offered for sale, will serious consideration be given to those offers? Can the Minister of State give the visitor numbers for heritage houses for each of the past five years?

      <P>I will provide information regarding visitor numbers for the Deputy. There is a large number of properties in the Department's portfolio already and a great deal of work is required to be done on them. The maintenance and development of existing properties requires considerable sums of money and there will not ever be enough money to do all the things that any Minister would like to do. Both the Minister and I have a great personal interest in heritage properties. Further facilities have been opened to the public and a balance must be maintained between conservation and the provision of access to the public. That issue must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any plans to acquire extra properties but that is an issue that should be taken on a case by case basis as properties become available. There will always be tension between acquiring more properties and providing and maintaining the best facilities at existing properties.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State did not answer Deputy Kenny's question regarding the website. The principal point which should be taken into consideration with heritage properties is that they are a valuable tourism amenity. They are so valuable that Bord Fáilte, in its examination of the reasons tourists visited Ireland, placed heritage properties at the top. Does the Minister of State agree that his reply was disappointing in that he did not say the allocation was greater this year or that he had a plan for the improvement of the portfolio?</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to provide additional resources for the National Archives to enable it to recruit additional staff and provide a better service having regard to the important function of the archive and the fact that important files due for release on 1 January 2000 were temporarily mislaid; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the need for extra staff resources for the National Archives and officials of the Department are examining proposals received from the Director of the National Archives in this regard, particularly since this necessitates an increase in the agreed core staff numbers for the Department. The proposals are being discussed with the director at present and the Minister hopes to be in a position to respond to them at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that response. The situation is being examined. The academics who use the National Archives speak of its professionalism and efficiency, but the incident which happened over Christmas is symptomatic of a number of things regarding the annual intake of files. Some files come years in advance, so in this review, is the Minister examining the area of additional space and the possibility of a system which will make the material more accessible? Obviously cross-referencing must be becoming a greater problem. For example, the Northern Ireland aspect of Government policy reaches into many Departments. Is it envisaged that such a link would be part of the new package coming from the director?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific incident after Christmas proved that people rush to form conspiracy theories whereas we know that the file <Col N="721" /> was mislaid. While it was found quickly, it afforded embarrassing opportunities for people to run wild with all types of grandiose conspiracy theories as to what happened. The reality was much more mundane.</P>
      <P>I wish to defend, as Deputy Kenny did, the integrity and professionalism of the staff of the National Archives who have in place new procedures to ensure adequate early warning where records have been accidentally omitted for consideration for release. That is a huge task in terms of the amount of records involved. Towards the end of 1997 the Department of Finance granted sanction in principle &ndash; a £30 million budget &ndash; to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for the adaptation of the National Archives' Bishop Street premises to provide extra storage. While the Department was carrying out the design of the project, at the request of Dublin Corporation suggestions were made for the provision of better facilities than those initially proposed. These suggestions are being looked at.</P>
      <P>The provision of adequate facilities and staff is absolutely vital to the National Archives. Members can rest assured that the Minister will do all in her power to ensure the National Archives' requirements are met as quickly as possible. Former Ministers will be aware of how tortuous it can be to make achievements in Government. I am sure Members understand that the Minister's best endeavours will take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect about the incident at Christmas with which I am concerned. Even though the files had been received from the Department of the Taoiseach some four years previously, when retrieved they had to be examined by staff of that Department to check whether any material should not be released. Should files not be scrutinised at the time of receipt so that the difficulty of having to examine them when time is of the essence does not arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether files are examined on receipt or release does not rise. The file in question was mislaid. The only reason there was such interest in the matter was that the conspiracy theorists immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion. The incident would not have been noticed had it related to any other file. Adequate procedures are in place to ensure that all files can be released on the date requested subject to the necessary clearances and I do not think any further difficulties will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no plans to introduce automatic index-linked increases in the television licence fee. Her view, and that of the Government, is that any proposed increases in the fee should be clearly justified on a case by case basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified the matter. The previous Government, of which I was a member, recognised in justifying the indexing of the licence fee the value of the public service broadcasting remit of RTE and the necessity to have quality programming at all times. Is the Minister of State aware of comment in recent times about the future of RTE and concerns that the station will have a £20 million deficit this year? Is he aware that, when the broadcasting Bill is enacted, RTE will be running not two stations but five? How then is it proposed that an income stream be provided to enable RTE to carry out its public service broadcasting remit and to fulfill its national responsibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The position outlined is exactly the justification for the Minister's decision to increase fees on a case by case basis. Index-linking would not do that and would leave us with the status quo. If there is a case for a larger increase it will have to be considered. The Minister is taking a decision to consider each case on its merits rather than using an automatic system which might give too much or too little depending on changing circumstances. Deputy Kenny has just illustrated a scenario whereby greater resources could be required. It is much wiser to deal with the matter on a case by case basis and make decisions, informed not by some formula of rote but by the requirements of public service broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that the Minister's position has been one of non-decision since her appointment? Nothing has been done to deal with this matter. Can he clarify what examination the Minister is making on a case by case basis in this regard? RTE currently operates two stations and provides £10 million to TG Ceathair. It will be required to run five stations when Digico and the Broadcasting Bill are implemented. No income stream has been provided for the company, which faces a deficit of £20 million this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister is disposed, as I am, to the extension of opening hours. That is the fundamental position. It is unfortunate this did not happen under previous Administrations. We are where we are, not where we would like to be, in terms of progress on this matter. The Deputy will agree that money is only one element of this and consultation with staff which includes attendants, cleaners, educational assistants, guides and <Col N="725" /> restaurant staff is important. It is important that now the Minister is favourably disposed to the extension of opening hours, procedures will be followed as rapidly as possible but that no short cuts will be taken which might cause difficulties. I know the Deputy would emphasise the need for staff consultation and agreement before opening hours are extended.</P>
      <P>There have been some good developments in the National Museum. Recently, a fantastic exhibition was jointly opened by the Minister, Deputy de Valera and the Minister, Mr. Michael McGimpsey. It was a great occasion. New events are taking place. We are looking forward to the opening of Turlough House, which will be of great interest to Deputy Kenny.</P>

      <P>I compliment the director of the National Museum, Dr. Wallace, on the manner in which he conducts his business. Does the Minister of State believe the National Museum should be open on bank holidays and on public holidays for our student population and visitors from abroad? Is there a definite date for when this will happen? I am sure the National Museum is on the Internet site. Does the Minister know the number of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; it has had in the past 12 months?</P>

Proposals are being finalised by museum management, which is the appropriate procedure. Subject to coming to suitable financial and personnel arrangements, the answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The Internet is not covered in the brief, but we will get the Deputy all the details as soon as we can.</P>

      <P>I said we are looking forward to the opening of Turlough House this year. I did not make any commitment as regards general opening hours. Procedures must be followed. It is wrong for politicians to make announcements of <Col N="726" /> this type until matters are finalised. This issue will be examined as favourably and as quickly as possible.

      <P>I think it is, but before we agree to it formally will the Taoiseach tell us when he will answer questions about what happened at his meeting with Deputy Foley?

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of Members, I will reiterate a number of points. The Chair has ruled on a number of occasions that issues currently before a tribunal are not a matter for the Order of Business. The Dáil must not attempt to have a parallel tribunal on these matters. Members will recall that the Chairman of the tribunal wrote to this effect. An extract of his letter was read into the record by the Taoiseach on 25 May 1999. I also remind Deputies that the Chair ruled on 11 May, and went on to say, it should be borne in mind the fact that the tribunal was established by a resolution of this House does not give the House a right to attempt to interfere in its proceedings.</P>
      <P>The resolution of this House establishing the tribunal was pursuant to the statute, the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts, 1920 to 1998, whereby the judicial proceedings, including evidence and the conduct of the hearings held thereunder, are clearly the sole responsibility of the judicial chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept everything the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said. My concern does not relate to any of those matters but to what the Taoiseach knew and did or did not ask. It relates to what the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did or said to the Taoiseach and also to a Member serving on the Committee of Public Accounts while in a particular position which is not being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal. Answers are required to these matters, particularly those pertaining to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the interests of the good order of the House and the reputation of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to have a confrontation with the Chair but he chose to quote from correspondence from the tribunal and I wish to do the same. When the Taoiseach was before the tribunal on 27 July last year, the sole member, Mr. Justice Moriarty said &ldquo;Well very good, Mr. Ahern, but I think the tribunal does not really wish to get involved in matters that should be perhaps discussed in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While I do not dispute the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's statement, the House is entitled at least to some explanation from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We have tried to ensure this within the rules of the House. Four Deputies made requests under Standing Order 31 but they were ruled out by the Chair, which is his entitlement. The Taoiseach on previous occasions has intervened with the acceptance and facilitation of the Chair. We are asking the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address a matter of grave public concern about the ethical performance of Members of this House. It is that basic.</P>

      <P>I understand that Deputy Foley is to be a witness before the Moriarty tribunal either this evening or tomorrow. As the Leas-<Col N="734" /> Cheann Comhairle stated, the tribunal was established on foot of resolutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I further note that Deputy Quinn has widely publicised the fact that he has exercised his right under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, to make a complaint concerning Deputy Foley to the statutory Committee of Members' Interests established under the Act. As indicated in the Act, that must be investigated. The words used in the Act are that a matter &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; investigated.</P>
      <P>As the Moriarty inquiry and the other matters are ongoing, I do not consider it appropriate for me or the House to comment on the matter in any detail at this time. The correctness of that view has been reinforced by the decisions of the Chair following what was lengthy correspondence on this matter on another occasion.

While I respect your judgments in the matter and I do not question the judgments you have made, the net effect of them is to ensure we do not have timely accountability.

      <P>If you are referring to the motion re Standing Order 106, I strongly disagree with the proposition before the House. Standing Order 106 has been used to discriminate against the smaller parties in this House, namely, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Socialist Party time and time again. We are seeing a situation once more where the accommodation is only for the two major parties, Fine Gael and Labour in opposition. This is simply unacceptable. The word &ldquo;muzzle&rdquo; was used earlier. The collective muzzling of the representation of the smaller opinions in this House has happened time and again during the past two and half years of this term of the 28th Dáil. The reality is that we have been excluded from access to Private Members' time and the opportunity of participation in statements before the House and, most recently, in relation to Helsinki.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the point I was making last week, even if there is a prime quality product for export, there is a serious problem regarding the promotion and marketing of that product within the community. The Bill and any other plans of the Government to develop the beef industry will be futile unless a commitment is given to the marketing and promotion of Irish beef abroad. I am happy that last Friday the Minister, Deputy Walsh, went to Italy to promote Irish beef because until last November he, as Minister, made only six trips abroad to promote Irish beef &ndash; that trip brings the number of trips to seven. If the Government is talking about promoting and marketing beef throughout the European Union and the rest of the world, it is a pity the Minister, who claimed he would travel to the four corners of the earth when he was in Opposition, has not done so.</P>
      <P>There are serious question marks over the future of the small and medium-sized beef producers and this has been highlighted by the recent blockade of meat factories. The Minister must look at alternative enterprises for those farmers. What will be the outcome of Leader III and how many communities will benefit from it? Will there be a reduction in the number of Leader groups? Will there be a reduction in their catchment areas? The Minister must ensure that there is off-farm employment for small farmers so that they have the opportunity to remain in their local community, produce a quality beef product and yet keep an income coming into their households. One can see the disillusionment among young farmers. A number of agricultural colleges have closed down and the installation aid and farm retirement schemes have been delayed until June or July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill focuses on the primary producer only rather than on processing, the supermarkets and the further steps in the chain. It regulates for the primary producer only and not, as Deputy Upton stated last Thursday, from farm to fork. If we are realistic about quality and, as I said last Thursday, the need for added-value products, not just simple cuts of meat, it is crucially important to have a control system which applies throughout the system and not only to one element of it. That is the area in which the <Col N="742" /> Bill is lacking and that is where it will ultimately fail.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will answer these questions when replying. What controls will be in place for third country beef coming into the EU? What controls will be in place for second country beef, that is, beef which comes from other parts of the EU, into Ireland? I am particularly concerned about third country beef because we have no control over it. Depending on how the WTO negotiations in Seattle develop over the coming months, US and Argentinean beef could come into supermarkets in the same way as lamb is imported. There will not be the same regulation on that meat coming into the supermarkets and onto a family's table, yet we will hamper farmers with these regulations and guidelines.</P>
    <P>The same is the case within the EU. Has the Minister discussed the possibility of broadening this on a European scale because it will hamper the competitiveness of farmers producing a product for the European market. One must remember that we cannot eat all the beef produced here so we must look at the broader view, that it will go into the European market and impose additional costs on the primary producer. There is no question about that and the Minister is unlikely to argue to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Liability for quality and traceability in the beef sector is an issue which must be considered. When everything is up and running, one will be able to trace a cut of meat from the supermarket shelf back to the farmer who produced it. The goal is to be able to trace it. The Government is putting in place legislation on quality in relation to the primary producer.</P>
    <P>That means that the meat can be traced back to the primary producer and, as far as this legislation is concerned, there are not any restrictions on the processor. If a person contracts food poisoning through e.coli 0157, for example, he could take a case against an individual farmer because things may not have been up to standard. While that is a hypothetical case, a situation could arise from something simpler, such as a broken needle being found in an animal carcase. The needle could have found its way there either through a farmer, a vet or others along the line. We have seen cases where these type of needles have been found in the pork curing process. A similar type of needle could be found in a carcase of beef which is being cured. What type of liability or onus is on the farmer in such a case? Has any consideration been given to the type and cost of insurance that farmers will require, given this traceability system which arises from the need for quality? There is a huge risk facing farmers, because while consumers will be able to pinpoint farmers, they may not be able to identify primary, secondary or tertiary processors. They will nail the farmer so the liability will fall to him and, in turn, he may have to place the onus on the processor.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also require farmers to have a licence to farm. They must have their names on <Col N="743" /> a register to be entitled to sell cattle, and their livelihoods will rely on such licences. Without them they will not be able to keep their businesses going. Section 17 deals with appeals against a refusal of the certificate of approval. If his licence to sell is removed, a farmer will have to make a case for reinstatement before the Circuit Court. That is unbelievably bureaucratic and the only people who stand to gain are the solicitors who take such cases.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Minister of State that such a system may be required at a later stage, a properly structured appeals system is needed, not like the bureaucratic one that currently operates in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. An independent appeals structure is required, similar to the office of the Ombudsman. Appeals made within the Department have failed, yet when a farmer takes his case to the Ombudsman, all of a sudden the decision changes within the Department. There must be an independent body outside the control of the Department. If a farmer fails in an appeal to that body then, well and good, he can take his case a step further to the Circuit Court. Bringing the Circuit Court in at an earlier stage, however, will only lead to solicitors making a fortune. In yesterday's newspapers we saw how well solicitors are doing from claims against the Department of Defence. A proper structure needs to be put in place to avoid a similar situation in the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>In the debate last Thursday, Deputy Upton mentioned that e.coli 0157 is not a notifiable disease. We have been slow to set up a database of notifiable diseases, especially bacterial ones, such as exists in other countries, including the United Kingdom. Consequently, it is difficult to determine where these outbreaks originate and whether there is a pattern involved, so that we can control and regulate them. It is crucially important that diseases like e.coli 0157 and other food-borne bacteria should be designated as notifiable diseases so they can be traced. In that way we can see if there is a repeat cause and if it is coming from a particular location. The legislation must deal with that matter along with the need to include processors and others involved in producing beef for the consumer's table.</P>
    <P>Luckily enough, antibiotics have not come to the fore in our beef industry, although they have figured in many other countries. Intensive farming practices put animals under stress, making them more susceptible to disease and, therefore, they are being fed antibiotics. We have seen this happening within the Minister of State's own sector of the bacon industry where antibiotics have been commonly used for many years. It happens in the poultry sector also. Our sheep and cattle are mainly reared on grass, which means that production is less intensive, thus reducing the need for antibiotics. The opposite is the case, however, for agricultural products imported from other EU and non-EU countries which employ more inten<Col N="744" /> sive farming practices. Over the years we have neglected that issue and are only now beginning to realise the importance of regulating antibiotics for farm animals. Recently, the issue has caused much controversy within the bacon sector.</P>
    <P>We must be serious about combating bacterial resistance to antibiotics, as well as being mindful of the correlation to what people eat, because such resistance may be transferred from one microbe to another. The Minister of State should examine the Swan report which was published in the United Kingdom many years ago, as well as a recent report on this matter by the Food Safety Authority. I hope the Minister of State will get an opportunity to reply to some of the queries I have raised.</P>

      <P>Much has happened since I originally requested an opportunity to speak on this Bill. We have had the unfortunate incidents of the recent past, due in part to the veterinary levy but more so to the relatively poor price farmers have been taking from processors. Such a low price, coming at a time when markets are reopening and domestic consumers are, it seems, paying a relatively high price for their meat, naturally raises questions. These are questions that farmers have been raising repeatedly, but which came to a head at the beginning of January. While sympathetic to the ongoing plight of farmers, I regret the fact that 200 workers in the Carrigans meat plant, in my own constituency, bore the brunt of being laid off as the protest wore on. I am heartened that a resolution has been found and I hope it will be accepted for what it is &ndash; a real improvement in farmers' incomes.</P>
      <P>There are long-term issues, however, that all sides should acknowledge and, therefore, last week's solution to the immediate problem should not be taken as a final point by all concerned. The outstanding issues should be dealt with in a cordial manner and not allowed to fester. I welcome the Tánaiste's initiative in putting this group together and having a three month timescale for the investigation into allegations of price-fixing. I look forward to a speedy conclusion of that inquiry. It makes sense that everyone involved in the industry should work for the common good and I trust the long hours of talks that have already taken place will provide the basis for a continuation of progress in building a positive relationship that has, in so many cases, been missing between core members of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to see that workers are to be compensated for the time they were out of work. I applaud, also, the efforts being made by the Minister to visit markets that have been threatened by the dispute. Everyone appreciates that without such markets, many farmers, factory workers and processors alike, would be made redundant, and <Col N="745" /> an even more serious future would be facing the farming industry.</P>
    <P>The industry must move on in the common interest. The purpose of the Bill is to increase the level of respect our beef gains nationally and internationally. While we undersell our animals in many ways, we have a grass based quality product that we can stand over and is well respected. This Bill will further emphasise that status.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers aspects such as the establishment of standards under which animals, carcases and meat intended for human consumption shall be produced, processed, traded or otherwise handled and under which feedstuffs shall be manufactured or traded. It continues and further develops the animal tracing system operated by the Minister through the collection of data on animal movement under the computerised cattle movement monitoring system, CCMS, and by such other means as the Minister considers appropriate. It also continues and develops measures provided under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. This is an all-embracing Bill that extends into all areas of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it will be an offence for a person to produce, trade or otherwise handle animals, carcases or meat for human consumption or to manufacture or trade in feedstuffs unless he or she is in possession of a certificate of approval. It will be an offence to sell or supply animals, carcases or meat for human consumption or to sell or supply feedstuffs without a certificate. Similarly, it will be an offence to buy or receive, or to own or operate a food business to buy or receive, or to be in the possession of animals, carcases or meat for consumption from a person who does not have a certificate. This seems all-encompassing and I trust it will cover every aspect of the meat industry.</P>
    <P>It is important when there are penalties that there are also avenues of appeal and opportunities for people to put their cases. I note there is a procedure whereby the applicant can appeal to the Circuit Court. Almost every rural Member of this House will have come across cases of farmers having to endure very severe penalties as a result of rather petty, genuine mistakes. This can relate to a tag coming out of an animal &ndash; which can be the fault of the tag or the animal as much as that of the person who inserted it &ndash; or to a box on a form not being ticked or some other perceived misdemeanour. Given the complexity of these forms and the proven difficulties in relation to adult illiteracy, many of these errors are genuine mistakes and not attempts to &ldquo;buck the system&rdquo;. While acknowledging the need for European moneys to be scrutinised, we constantly see a lack of common sense applied to such cases. I hope there will be simple appeal mechanisms to give all involved a chance to air their case in relation to this legislation, rather than having to resort to legal channels. An appeal to the Circuit Court seems to be the only channel of appeal at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> While the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Bill are to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, I wonder if these are the only moneys needed. I presume there will be a cost involved for applicants who want to meet the criteria for the certificate of approval and adhere to the new regulations. For example, will there be financial supports for family abattoirs to enable them to raise the standard of their premises? Standards are already increasing significantly with the continuing stringency of the environmental health operators. However, this results in a financial burden on people who are already under pressure. I presume other sectors will also be affected by this legislation. While the highest of standards must always be aspired to and commended, it is also important that the necessary supports are given to turn aspirations into reality.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of inspection. The Minister may make regulations establishing the procedures for the periodic reinspection of premises and holdings to ensure continued compliance with this Bill and the regulations made under it. I presume this is standard. There is a need, however, to outline who will police this legislation. Will manpower resources be provided to ensure there is a balanced level of inspection from region to region, thus ensuring standards?</P>
    <P>This issue of manpower resources applies to the entire Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. A large number of schemes is being administered, some of which are beginning, others are being reviewed and others are long-standing. The cumulative strain on the system is huge. I call on the Minister to look at the state of the regional offices, the workload and the backlog. The officials are doing their best but they are overstretched. This has large repercussions for particular schemes and the farmers with whom we come into contact. I trust the Minister will look sympathetically at cases where people did not get grants because their application did not get through the system in time, which seems unfair.</P>
    <P>At a time when all elements within agriculture &ndash; pigs, sheep and beef &ndash; are under pressure, every effort must be made to stabilise the industry and promote a product that can command a high price for its producer. While being proud of the generally high quality of the grass based animal we produce in Ireland, anything that helps to further the confidence of consumers at home and abroad in relation to our beef sector is important and welcome. I commend the work in my area of the Inishowen co-operative, which is working towards producing a quality assured animal, and I wish them continued progress in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>I accompanied the Minister when he visited Carrigan's meat plant a number of months ago. At that time, the computerised cattle monitoring system was just moving beyond a concept. I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure the development of the system and to <Col N="747" /> guarantee it operates at an optimum level. The &ldquo;stable to table&rdquo; guarantee is essential now and is a buzz phrase in many European countries. It is important that Ireland is seen to be leading the way.</P>
    <P>Very few countries have the good reputation for animals that we rightly have. However, we have had difficulties recently with BSE. With the recent announcement that the Russians are lifting their ban on animals from Donegal, among other counties, the future of our exports has become even brighter. I congratulate the Minister on the improvements that continue to be made to provide dedicated livestock vessels for live exports. There are now 17 approved vessels, compared to nine in 1996. However, when will there be a facility closer to the north-west, given our geographical location and distance from the current operational ports?</P>
    <P>On a personal level, I ask the Minister to continue to ensure that any difficulties arising in relation to our hard fought for existing markets, as a result of the factories being out of action, are monitored and the necessary supports put in place to secure them. This is an agriculture Bill and, as a Border Deputy from an area with many pig producers who have been disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control, I thank the Minister, his team in the Department and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for helping to alleviate the desperate situation caused by the burning of the Lovell and Christmas plant. A Border facility should be put in place very soon to offer competition to producers.</P>
    <P>The importation of all types of meat adds to the crisis we are experiencing in Ireland in terms of demand and price. The amount of pigmeat, sheepmeat and beef being imported is constantly increasing. I recently spent some time in France examining its sheep sector system. Given that it is not a mass exporter but an importer of meat, it is in a slightly different category from Ireland. However, I found there was a very strong interest in the promotion of the French home product. Each region is proud of its animal. In the region I visited, the Adret lamb was the speciality and was only one of a variety of French lamb available to the consumer. In the abattoir I visited there were &ldquo;labelled&rdquo; animals, regular animals, a more organic type of animal and imported animals. An effort is made there to promote the national product to consumers. I spoke to French people who were happier to buy a good quality French product than a cheaper import because they had an awareness of the &ldquo;labelled&rdquo; animal.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that we are all Europeans, we need to develop a sense of positive nationalism in protecting one of our most basic commodities and sources of income when faced with stiff and growing competition from many non-European countries. We must develop a new type of &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; mode. I ask the Minister to evaluate the success of current marketing by An Bord Bia and the other agencies and, if necessary, <Col N="748" /> to follow up such an evaluation with appropriate action. The bottom line is that we have a product of which we can be proud. It is only when we, as consumers, advocate this message that our nation will gain confidence. That message will then ultimately permeate to the wider markets. This must lead to a higher return for the quality animal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this comprehensive Bill. I am a farmer and the BSE scare in 1996 greatly affected farmers' incomes. Recently, dioxin in food in Belgium had serious repercussions for the beef and food industry there.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enhance the confidence of the consumer in Irish cattle and beef. The high standards of public health protection it proposes will apply to livestock marts, abattoirs, slaughter houses, businesses engaged in food protection and those which manufacture or deal in animal feedstuffs. Its implementation can only enhance and strengthen the animal identification and traceability measures already in place for cattle. The provision to make regulations regarding the notification of animal movements is a key component of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The market for beef has seen radical change in recent years. If consumers cannot have absolute confidence in the food they buy, farmers will not have a market. Food safety has to be a priority. It is vital that consumers in Ireland and abroad know Irish producers are serious about food safety.</P>
      <P>Irish food is marketed in more than 50 countries. The industry is an important contributor to the economy and to the income of more than 250,000 people. The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill will protect producers and consumers. It will display our willingness to be proactive and committed to the production of a safe and quality food product. Setting high standards and leading the way in this regard will undoubtedly have a positive effect on Ireland's image internationally.</P>
      <P>Following the BSE crisis, we lost valuable markets such as France and Germany. A number of third countries also refused our product. Consumption at home also fell dramatically. A number of initiatives have since been introduced at EU and departmental level to promote food safety and hygiene. These initiatives have been introduced at all stages of production, distribution and sale. The overall market for Irish beef has improved but further measures are needed to allay consumers' concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef produced here has its own unique taste and flavour and is capable of commanding a premium price. Beef production accounts for more than 40% of our agricultural output. Nine out of ten animals produced by more than 140,000 herd owners are exported. An over-dependency on Third World markets can produce its own share of problems for the trade. The collapse of the Russian market last year is just one example. This collapse saw the resumption of <Col N="749" /> sales into intervention in autumn 1998 and in spring 1999. Recent years have been very difficult for our beef sector.</P>
    <P>This National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill is an important landmark in the area of food production and safety. It will ensure common standards throughout the industry. This, in turn, will protect the Irish industry from uninformed criticism in the event of any further food scares. The consumer dictates the market and in the area of food, the market has been decided.</P>
    <P>Consumers also need to be sure the meat they buy is safe. Meat imports should also be subject to strict quality assurance procedures. Other countries have not been slow to delay the entry of meat from Ireland into their markets. I call on the Minister and the Minister of State to make sure all regulations on meat imports are adhered to. This Bill offers the best long-term prospects for our beef industry. In the future, it will provide better returns for producers through guaranteed markets.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a monetary application, inspection, approval and registration process for all participants, the propose of which is to provide independently backed assurance of the safety of Irish beef. It will take some time to complete the inspection process. It provides for transitional arrangements under which all participants will be deemed to be provisionally approved until they have been granted or refused approval under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points on this issue. Everybody wants safe food. I predict that in the coming years general elections will be fought on two issues. They will not be fought on taxation, what is happening in Europe, local issues or farmers leaving the land but on food safety and water safety.</P>
      <P>I talked to a number of farmers about this Bill. Farmers, like others in society, do not like change. Nobody likes to see legislation introduced. The owner of a shop recently asked me what we are doing in this mad house and said nobody will be able to stay in business in the next few years. He said he got six letters in the post that morning, one from Revenue telling him he owed so much in tax, one in relation to VAT, one from the county council looking for rates, one stating an egg inspector was coming to his shop and another from the litter warden stating that he should not have signs or dirt outside his premises. This country has gone mad with legislation, rules and regulations which will put people out of business. If we continue in this way, there will not be enough offices to deal with all the paperwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department has responsibility for the quality of beef. I have listened to farmers at public meetings state that we have the best product in the world, but we do not. If we think that, we are losing it. In 1998, the McKinsey report and An Bord Bia said that of the national kill in 1998, 17% was fit for the European market. Early in the 1990s, 40% of the kill was fit to be <Col N="750" /> sent to Europe. Not every country wants our beef or believes we have the best beef in the world. I was sad to note yesterday that the incidence of BSE increased again in January.</P>
    <P>The last three priority questions I tabled related to the quality of our beef and the Department's intentions in regard to getting farmers to do what is necessary to increase the percentage of the national kill fit for the European market from 17% to 60% or 70%.</P>
    <P>The other question I tabled related to brucellosis. I was delighted to see that the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> ran exclusives about this matter. This is another major problem for the beef sector and it is one with which we must deal. We must remember that we live in a small world. People can use the Internet to see what is happening in Ireland or in any other country and they will want to be guaranteed that the beef, steak or lamb they purchase is safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will recall recent events in Belgium where problems arose in respect of chocolate. There was a major outcry here regarding the importation of such chocolate. As a public representative I have been asked whether we have the relevant staff in place to monitor what is being imported to this country. Do we know what is being brought into Dublin port? What foodstuffs are we importing, where do they originate and is their safety guaranteed by anyone?</P>
    <P>I partly welcome the introduction of the national beef assurance scheme. However, I am concerned that it will lead to an explosion of red tape. My town and many others throughout the country have small, family run abattoirs which do a good job. The abattoirs to which I refer were operating well until veterinary inspectors were appointed by every county council throughout the country. These inspectors tend to announce the time at which they will visit an abattoir, at 3 p.m. on a certain day to watch the kill. Following the kill, the inspectors say that they might return in one or two days to inspect the carcases which means that they cannot be moved until the inspection has taken place. That is wrong. Veterinary inspectors do not behave in this way when dealing with Larry Goodman or any of the other three major beef processors. Vets are present in beef factories on a full-time basis from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some of them are present for only 30 minutes and they are paid for a full day's work. However, that is another issue and it is one with which I do not propose to deal at this stage.</P>
    <P>Why is the Department intent on attacking small operators? I am concerned that the national beef assurance scheme will involve huge amounts of red tape with which small farmers will not be able to deal. Having made a mistake, these people will be summonsed to appear in court because they have not complied with the law. After that they will leave the land &ndash; 8,000 people in County Mayo have already done so &ndash; and end their connections with agriculture simply because <Col N="751" /> the Minister of State and the Department feel the need to comply with all the rules imposed by the European Union.</P>
    <P>I liken this situation to that which obtained when we joined the EU, when we were informed that we would be able to travel to Scotland, Northern Ireland, England or Belgium, purchase and drive away in a Mercedes Benz car and not be obliged to pay tax on it. However, the Government acted quickly by introducing legislation to prevent people doing that.</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural and other regulations, the situation is somewhat similar to that which obtains in Italy. The Italians take everything that is good out of the EU but they are not very good at implementing EU laws. In Ireland we are great at implementing those laws, regardless of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill and I have no difficulty with it. However, problems may arise if farmers discover that the scheme is too restrictive or that they cannot deal with the red tape involved. My party will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage and I hope they will be taken on board by the Minister and the Department. There is no point introducing legislation and asking farmers to comply with it if people are going to be put out of business or if there will be a major cost factor involved.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks everyone saw how hard farmers fought for their industry. They were not fighting because of the behaviour of the factories or because they were not being paid a particular price, they were fighting for survival. If matters had remained as they were, many of those people would have been obliged to leave agriculture in the coming months.</P>
    <P>My party is giving the Bill a cautious welcome but we do not want to see the various rules and regulations weighing down on one side and not on the other. We are seeking fair play, something which the Department is not good at encouraging. For example, the penalties it imposes in respect of simple or silly mistakes are outrageous. I have put together a dossier in respect of a number of cases in this area and I must inform the Minister of State that I am looking forward to taking his Department to court.</P>
    <P>I wish to provide an example of one of the cases to which I refer involving a matter which I brought to the attention of the Minister of State. The wife of a man living in my constituency died at a time when the family was experiencing major problems. The individual in question sent a completed form to the Department which was either late in arriving or contained incorrect information. He had experienced no problems during the past 20 years in dealing with the Department but &ndash; this would not happen on Hitler's worst day &ndash; he lost his entire payment. I understand the man may have filled out the figure &ldquo;31&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;13&rdquo; and he was penalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I tabled a priority question inquiring whether the Minister intended to appoint an ombudsman to oversee matters in this area. He acknowledged that the Department is considering the establishment of a new appeals structure. I hope that such appeals will be held at county level because faceless officials in the Department can send out a form saying that they do not wish to pay a farmer his entitlement. That is what is happening at present. During the past three years the penalties have become increasingly severe and there is no attempt at understanding on the part of the Department. That is wrong because people living in rural areas were never trained to complete these forms. They have received no training to help them comply with the provisions of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should not be afraid to take on the civil servants in his Department because some of them would not know a pig from a cow or a cow from a lamb. However, we allow them to adjudicate on matters relating to agriculture. That is wrong. If the Minister of State is not strong enough to take action, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, should do so. The Minister has occupied Agriculture House for 11 of the past 13 years. There is a cosy cartel operating between the Minister and his officials because he knows how they think and they know how he thinks. The Minister is not strong enough to take action and there is a need for an injection of new blood. The Minister must say to his officials &ldquo;Joe Soap made a simple mistake, pay the man because he is entitled to his money.&rdquo;  We must move away from the attitude of not overruling departmental officials.</P>
    <P>If I am ever appointed to serve in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development tribunals will be held every week, the officials will follow my orders and they will not do as they please. The Minister of State, the Minister and other members of the Government should adopt that attitude because we must stop the ongoing attacks on rural life. Poor farmers in Mayo, Roscommon and Galway were not trained in the completion of the forms supplied by the Department.</P>
    <P>I listened to a farming programme on radio the other evening during which reference was made to the closing date for a certain scheme. The host issued warnings to farmers to be careful about the information they supplied. Farmers would want to be retrained or sent to university but even then they would not be able to complete the relevant forms. When I entered public life, I warned my secretary never to complete a form because if a mistake was made she would be blamed. People are not trained to complete these forms, which is wrong. As stated earlier, the officials of the Department are acting like Hitler. The Department's deciding officers are not understanding or sympathetic to people involved in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister of State and the other two incumbents in the Department took on their officials. There is a difference between an act of <Col N="753" /> fraud and a simple mistake. The people in the Department who deal with area aid forms and other application forms know the difference between an act of fraud and a mistake. However, they are no longer interested in what is happening.</P>
    <P>They do not want to know anymore. The position is similar in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has gone berserk. Three people visited my constituency office yesterday concerning social welfare benefits. These people are genuinely looking for work and had letters to prove so. However, the Department is still not satisfied, it wants more letters and is stopping payments to these people. The area aid office and the appeals unit are similar in that there is no give for farmers. The message coming from these units is that they have no interest in farmers. They are telling farmers to get out of rural Ireland and get out of the country entirely in preference to people coming in.</P>
    <P>I attended a recent public meeting in rural Ireland at which it was evident that an undercurrent is building up against politicians, the Government and the Civil Service. People are getting ready to stand up and be counted. People died in 1921 for a bit of fair play but events in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Social, Community and Family Affairs do not constitute fair play and that is wrong. Officials working for county councils, urban councils or Departments would have to murder someone before being sacked. It does not matter whether they can do the job they will be left there. It is time for accountability and I see this on a daily basis as a public representative.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between fraud and a mistake. I referred to the man whose wife died and there was a second tragedy in the family. This man filled out a form incorrectly and all his payments were stopped. That is not democracy, it is dictatorship, and there is enough of that in the world.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill but it will be difficult to address all the issues raised by Deputy Ring. We must recognise that food safety and water quality are also considerations and that is why I welcome this important legislation and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, for remaining in the House to listen to our contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is timely when further outbreaks of BSE are being notified. We have a responsibility to ensure food safety. Reference <Col N="754" /> has been made to the strictures laid down by the Department by way of grant payments and so on, but there are also strictures laid down by health boards by way of food safety regulations. Members who saw the effects of CJD realise that while we may complain about guidelines laid down by the Department we must be far more concerned about the effects of insufficient controls in the food sector. Consumer groups have highlighted the fact that we need to strengthen existing controls and that is why I welcome this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks Members, particularly those who are not close to the agricultural scene, have had an opportunity to meet farmers on the picket lines. It is important for the Government to reassure consumers that food safety is a priority. The only way we can increase the purchasing power and the cost factors involved in beef production is to reassure domestic and international consumers that the Government is committed to food safety. Improving food standards provides the ideal method for beef producers to increase profit margins. We can achieve this objective by showing consumers that their health is of foremost consideration for the Department, the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The recent protests by farmers gave us time to think of how we can increase the commercial trading performance of our beef sector. One way to achieve this is to introduce further controls to communicate the message that food safety is a priority, as it has been in the past. The Bill provides for the establishment of a national beef assurance scheme which I welcome. This scheme involves a number of practical proposals, including the development of common standards for the production, processing and tracing of Irish cattle and beef for human consumption, and the manufacture and trade of feeding stuffs. We must all approve of the application of these standards through a system of registration, inspection and approval. The enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle has been highlighted to Members over the years by consumer groups, retail chains and the farming community. This proposal is part of a strategy to protect the health of consumers and, importantly, to protect our multi-billion pound beef industry.</P>
    <P>Given the substantial contribution of the beef sector to the economy, it is vital that everything possible is done to protect and promote the industry. The beef trade represents 2% of GNP, employs 10,000 people in processing and realised £1.1 billion in primary beef production in the past year. These statistics indicate the importance of ensuring that the beef trade is promoted and safeguarded. The best way to achieve this is to assure consumers that Irish beef is safe and that the Government is intent on ensuring that that continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>Farmers will have to achieve improved returns if they are to stay in the beef trade. A rate of 90p per pound has been secured but that is not a just return for beef produced at a cost of 82p per <Col N="755" /> pound. The way to increase prices is to increase competition and that will only be achieved by increasing our trading markets. We must show our proactive interest and commitment to the production of safe, high quality food through the promotion of higher standards. I welcome the fact that the Bill provides for mandatory application, inspection, approval and registration processes for all applicants. This will provide independently backed assurances concerning the safety of Irish beef which is the cornerstone of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive system of animal identification already exists for Irish cattle, including bovine tagging and cattle identity cards. The Bill will reinforce the requirement for relevant participants to notify the movement of all cattle onto or off their holdings or premises. It has consistently been pointed out that the cornerstone of policy should be to ensure regulation in the movement of cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for regulations setting out the form and time of notifications and the procedure for the use of the CMMS database to identify and trace animals slaughtered for human consumption. The inclusion of CMMS provisions in the Bill is necessary to provide the requisite legal powers to ensure that participants comply with the requirements regarding the notification of animal movements and that animals whose origin and life history cannot be verified can be barred from entering the human food chain. This important provision will go a long way to reassuring consumers that food safety is a priority.</P>
    <P>When Commissioner David Byrne received his appointment there was a feeling that his portfolio was lower down the pecking order of responsibility. However, in the past few months it has become obvious throughout Europe that food safety is the foremost consideration for consumers. This ties in with the Government's commitment to follow the lead set by Commissioner Byrne and to ensure that all possible proposals are implemented. This legislation goes a long way towards achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>The important issue for consumers is that the origin and history of all cattle and beef entering the food chain can be verified and the fact that the entire national herd can now be traced and recorded must impact on consumers. Another important aspect of the Bill is that it imposes obligations on the retail sector to provide guidelines on the safety of beef across the food chain.</P>
    <P>While controls have been in place for some time, further controls will confirm that the Government is intent on ensuring food safety. By that standard, it is going a long way toward increasing the market share of Irish beef.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Maloney for sharing his time. I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Ring said about butchers and small abattoirs. It is a phenomenon particular to the west that many of those people have had to leave the <Col N="756" /> business because of strict regulations. In County Galway the small family butchers are forming an organisation to take their case to the Department. I welcome the fact that they are pooling their resources and hope they will be able to meet the standards laid down in the guidelines. It is regrettable, however, that so many of them had to close because they did not have the resources to compete with the bigger operators.</P>
      <P>This Bill is relevant when we read in the newspapers that there have been further outbreaks of BSE &ndash; already this year there have been 14 cases. These took place in cattle between five and eight years of age and that shows that the tightening up of the 1996 regulations is bearing fruit. It is worrying, however, that there has been a reduction in beef consumption across the European Union. The Minister said that the possible link between BSE and new variant CJD in young people is worrying. I hope that the efforts of the Minister and the Ministers of State will be supported by the House. We must fight for consumer confidence in the industry, that is the number one priority.</P>
      <P>There are markets to which Ireland supplied cattle and beef in the past where trade restrictions have been imposed and this has been of major concern to the Department. It is good that we have managed to re-enter some of those markets. Further measures are required in the beef industry to provide confidence at home and abroad. We must tighten up the conditions in the production and processing of beef in Ireland. This is provided for in the Bill. We must also assure consumers about the safety of Irish cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>The IFA sought assurances from the Department when the Bill was first published on how it would operate. Through its animal health committee the IFA made it known that it was happy that there would be transitional arrangements, that farmers would be provisionally approved for the scheme and subsequently inspected. The IFA did not want a new industry to be created as a result of legislation. The legislation was introduced at a bad time for the farming community, while the agriculture sector was going through a difficult time. The IFA asked valid questions about the inspection process, who will carry it out and the frequency of inspections. These are issues the Minister will address but it is obvious from the sheer frustration of farmers on the picket lines outside meat factories that they need help from the Government and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Macra na Feirme proposed partnerships in farming. That was a positive proposal. A partnership arrangement would provide an incentive for new entrants. Legislation should be introduced to enable such partnerships to operate. Teagasc, to its credit, has also been talking about a way forward for some time through partnership in agriculture. Mr. McCarthy, one of the chief advisers in Teagasc, said that partnership farming means a five day week, weekends off, cover for sickness and annual holidays combined with an improved <Col N="757" /> capacity to expand the business through economies of scale and better labour efficiency. It almost sounds too good to be true. Mr. McCarthy is talking about farming as a business. That is what is happening in countries such as Denmark and France. If we are realistic we recognise that there are labour problems on all farms, irrespective of size or location. We must look at these areas where there could be help for the farming community.</P>
    <P>The role of the wholesaler and retailer in the chain of protection of the consumer is not addressed in this legislation, which deals with the role of the producer. We are all aware of situations in which an imported product could be purchased from a retail outlet and it would not be subject to regulation. The point was made by many in the farming organisations that a restaurant or retail outlet would not be subject to such policing. It is important that the whole chain, from the producer to the consumer, is covered by legislation. If only one part of the chain is dealt with there will be difficulties.</P>
    <P>When the meat factories were picketed, the issue of the live export trade was raised. In an ideal world we would be able to finish and process all our cattle in Ireland. If we did not have live shipping, however, there would be a further reduction in the price of cattle. The Irish Cattle Traders and Stock Owners Association has made the point that we should continue with live shipping. The association's slogan is &ldquo;no live shipping, no competition&rdquo;. We need to strike a balance between live exports and meat factories. There cannot be a monopoly.</P>
    <P>Breeding for the market is also important. The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation has made the point that the Irish beef herd has too many animals that are not wanted by the market and too few that are. We must be conscious that we are breeding for the market and must make available information for farmers which will enable them to pick animals for any type of market, including the European retail market, third country markets and live export markets. The question of breeding is important.</P>
    <P>There is conflict between the US and Europe with regard to biotechnology in the agri-food sector. This was an issue at the World Trade Organisation talks. We must be ready for this struggle and we must have consumer confidence in whatever new technology becomes available. We must examine the issue of cleaner cattle. The farming organisations know that it takes only a small amount of e.coli, for example, to cause infection. We must stress the importance of this issue. The question of artificial hormones in cattle was also discussed at the WTO talks. We should ensure that our beef can be sold as hormone-free. Commissioner David Byrne is very concerned with the question of food safety and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should support and promote the work of the Commissioner and avoid the food production policies of the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The Bill is welcome and I hope the Minister will address some of the points I have raised. At all times we must remember what the consumer wants and bear that in mind when we discuss the other issues which will arise in the course of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the national beef assurance scheme. The announcement of the outbreak of BSE in March 1996 was a watershed in the Irish beef industry and it has taken us a considerable time to put the necessary responses to that crisis in place. I welcome the Bill and the opportunities which this debate offers to reflect on the beef industry, its shortcomings and the opportunities it presents, in a calm atmosphere. In the heat of the recent crisis in the beef industry we did not have an opportunity for in-depth analysis or to put in place the responses necessary to ensure that the industry has a future and that many thousands of farmers can continue to make a living in beef production.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt referred to the 14 BSE cases in January 2000 and these figures are particularly disappointing. In the calm light of day many farmers would accept that BSE was in our cattle before 1996 but was not treated with the same degree of concern as it now is. We are in an era of heightened consumer awareness and we must respond to this with appropriate policies. The use of meat and bonemeal in beef production is referred to in the Bill and the Department must look keenly at this issue which is particularly important in terms of licensing. I know the Minister is aware of its importance.</P>
      <P>This debate offers us the opportunity to look at the industry as a whole and at the absolute need to ensure a viable income for farmers in beef production. We must look at the inefficiencies in the industry at farm gate level and in the processing sector. We would do a disservice to Irish agriculture and to beef production in particular if we were to conclude, as one might from listening to last week's debate, that the only problem in the industry is the alleged cartel. I await with interest the conclusions of the three wise men who have been appointed. I have considerable confidence in their abilities to analyse promptly the allegations regarding a cartel. The cartel is neither the major problem nor the only problem in the beef industry. The issue we must face is not that there are only three main players but that those three players control too many meat plants. To borrow a phrase from another political arena, we must decommission a number of those plants. There is some concern regarding Glanbia's future in meat processing. We have an opportunity to rationalise the meat processing industry. If all the sugar beet in the country can be processed in two plants, one in Mallow and one in Carlow, we do not need 46 meat plants to process our beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great increase in cattle numbers. We do not have a huge market on our doorstep and the renationalisation of beef consump<Col N="759" /> tion means we must make our beef marketing much more efficient. We have a successful marketing strategy in our dairy industry. We need a similar strategy for our meat industry which will involve all producers and processors and which will create a brand image for Irish beef that will transcend consumer loyalties in the countries which import our beef. The purpose of the Bill is to enable our produce to acquire a production standard that we can fully support. The Bill will not add a penny to farmers' pockets. We will be lucky if it can maintain farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>As well as the questions of cartels and beef marketing we must address the fact that there are too many accidental beef producers who believe that because they have the by-product of a dairy industry which is largely Holstein based they have the raw material of a beef industry. We must encourage more purpose-bred and purpose-fed beef production rather than accidental beef production based on the by-product of the dairy industry. There will be a disadvantage for the dairy industry in that transition but if we wish to ensure a future for the large number of farmers in beef production who do not have milk quotas we must make that transition.</P>
    <P>Initially I welcomed the establishment of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and was impressed with Dr. Wickham's production but there is scant evidence that it is making the progress that is necessary. I hope the Minister can reassure us that progress is being made.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with a licence to farm. In principle, I do not object to that. Ownership of a herd number is, in effect, a licence to farm. This took no account of a herd owner's understanding of agricultural production, his ability to carry out that process to a proper standard or to look after the welfare and health of his animals. Anyone who had a cattle crush and testing facilities on his farm was entitled to a herd number. This was a very loose arrangement. While some have expressed concern at the concept of a licence to farm, I welcome it. We have seen district justices prosecuting people for keeping animals in inhumane conditions and the principle of the licence to farm is acceptable. It is also acceptable in detail. There are ample checks and balances in terms of rights of appeal etc. It is welcome and I have no difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about section 4 which is the blanket exemption for the food industry. If customers are being assured of the absolute quality of the production being engaged in, notwithstanding that the food processing industry is covered by a myriad of other regulations, it should be remembered that much of the difficulty with the contamination of food products arises in their processing, handling and storage. With traceability and the ability to identify from what farm a specific cut of meat comes, if there is a problem with the cut of meat, the finger will be pointed at the producer. That will create questions about his <Col N="760" /> licence to farm. It does not acknowledge the path which food follows from producer to consumer. Others will have handled the produce and there are significant dangers of contamination. I will take some convincing that the blanket exemption for the food industry is merited. That is notwithstanding the food hygiene regulations governing abattoirs to which other speakers have referred. I am aware that the industry is also subject to regulations from the Department of Health and Children. That exemption requires further examination. The farming community would be concerned about it. While they are prepared to stand four-square behind the produce which leaves their holding, there is a fear that, with traceability, the finger will be pointed exclusively at farmers. That would be unfair and is a severe weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 empowers the Minister to make regulations governing the registration and identification of bovine animals, especially the possession of ear tags, identity cards and the tampering with them with a view to falsifying animal identification. No one in their right mind would object to this. However, it is a part of the industry which is being built on the backs of farmers. There is not a brown penny in it for them. It is running flat out to stand still to try to arrest a decline in incomes. No farmer will stand over fraudulent activity such as tampering with cattle identity tags. However, there is a feeling that the law moves extremely slowly against those identified as being involved. While the hit squad in the Department has something of a reputation, the system of justice must move more quickly in dealing with these people. There are numerous cases throughout the country where prosecution is pending and where a number of farmers assume these people will ride roughshod over the system with no successful prosecutions. Justice delayed is justice denied and it damages the confidence of the agricultural community in the system. These are the people who pay through increased bureaucracy and they would like to see those jeopardising their incomes and livelihoods prosecuted, jailed and met with the full rigours of the law. While the section is welcome, it must be seen to work quickly against those who break the law.</P>
    <P>Section 21 obliges keepers of animals to notify cattle movements and empowers the Minister to establish procedures for access to the register of certificates of approval and to the CMMS, the animal traceability system database, having regard to the rights of individuals and undertakings, and to make regulations regarding notification and recording of cattle movements and the use of the CMMS database to identify and trace cattle slaughtered for human consumption. This identifies one of the major structural problems in the beef industry: the multiple movements of cattle from cradle to grave. While it is probably utopian to expect that we could have incubated cradle to grave units on all farms, the estimate at present is that each animal moves six times before <Col N="761" /> slaughter. Each dealer and haulier takes the profit out of farmers' pockets. No cattle movement costs less than £20 and farmers' profits should be that multiplied by the six times cattle move. While acknowledging that the movement system must be regulated and monitored, we need to incentivise more cradle to grave operations and minimise cattle movements. It should not be beyond the capacity of officials in the Department in conjunction with the Minister of State to devise a system which would incentivise that type of beef production. It is in the area of cattle movements that the profit of farmers goes down the drain.</P>
    <P>This scheme is part of the bureaucracy which drives farmers demented. Deputy Ring dealt at length with it and it was amusing in some ways because he used colourful language. However, it is a reality and there is not one Deputy in rural Ireland who is not familiar with at least 20 cases in one 12 month period where they can stand over what are bona fide mistakes rather than fraudulent intent. We are not such fools that we are taken in by every client who appears at constituency clinics. We know those who ran the risk and were caught and we have little sympathy for them. However, there is not one rural Deputy who would not be familiar with at least 20 cases in any 12 month period. The appeals unit in Hume House in Dublin 4 is a joke and is as removed from the reality of the predicament of farmers as it is possible to be. There is a need for a regionalised approach to appeals. That is an urgent necessity if farmers are being asked to take this scheme on board. They must be convinced they are getting a fair deal from the Department. It is one of the major outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>In terms of farmers seeing something in return for their efforts, if the industry is rationalised and the number of processors is reduced, the other side is that there must be a strong marketing strategy. What happens at present between the main processors is inexcusable. One processor may secure a contract with a multiple in the UK or on the Continent. Next week one of its competitors, which also sells Irish beef, undercuts the other processor, either within or outside the EU, on the basis that the reduction can be passed back to the primary producer. That, more than the veterinary inspection levy, was what brought farmers out in protest. There was a feeling that they would always be the patsy to take the hit. If there is a lesson to be learned from the debacle last week, it is that farmers are beginning to fight back and there are a number of issues to be tackled in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in so far as it goes. It will not put money in farmers' pockets but it might arrest the slide in their incomes. A number of other issues remain to be tackled, such as rationalising the industry, marketing and purpose-bred and purpose-fed animals for previously identified markets. There has been a lack of urgency in the Department in dealing with these issues but, in <Col N="762" /> the wake of BSE, we cannot afford to continue with a haphazard approach to beef production. The margins are too small. Accidental producers piggybacking in on the dairy industry are probably the first casualty. All these issues must be tackled to put in place an industry which can face into the new millennium. The Minister of State would do well to take those issues on board as much as consumer assurances on beef production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to establish a regulatory body and to introduce regulations to ensure that the Minister, the Minister of State, An Bord Bia and other marketing agencies can market Irish beef abroad. Most of us understand that and are led to believe that when prime Irish beef is produced to the highest standards it is probably among the best in the world. We have experienced major difficulties and disadvantages over the years concerning the selling of beef. Four years ago the BSE crisis erupted. That was one of the worst disasters to hit the Irish beef industry and beef industries throughout the Continent. There has been a collapse in Third World markets. We have seen and continue to see skulduggery within the industry. There is no incentive for the primary producer or, to a certain extent, in terms of breeding.</P>
      <P>I come from a dairy farming background. From what I have heard from various people within the industry over the years, particularly the past 15 to 20 years, in the 1960s and maybe earlier an effort was made to ensure that quality milk was delivered to the creameries or the stands. There were numerous tests such as the methylene blue test, the litmus paper test and, in the 1980s, the ACC and TBC tests were introduced. These tests have ensured that if anything goes wrong with a batch of cheese or other dairy product &ndash; I mention cheese because it is the product of my local co-op in Newmarket &ndash; which leaves Ireland through An Bord Bia or the offices of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which has marketed it, it can be traced. There is traceability within the sector. It can be traced back to the farm, organisation or co-op which produced it. Unless this kind of system is applied within the beef industry, we will not progress. Most farmers would, from time to time, have experience of the slaughterhouses or the meat processing factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weekends ago I discussed this legislation with a group of people, one of whom was a graduate from the food science department of UCC. I asked him about the situation where one is in a meat factory and the grading of the cattle is taken, which is not an expert qualification. There is a computer test for milk and the raw materials of the dairy industry or dairy products. Surely some test could be applied for traceability of beef, and a carcase or some part of the carcase could be taken out and sampled to give greater accountability. From my understanding of the information I am given, it is possible, but unless we take every step necessary at departmental <Col N="763" /> level and in terms of the primary producer, we will not make progress.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers, particularly the Minister, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who believes that there has to be rationalisation within the system and that having in excess of 40 meat processors processing our beef creates multiplicity and excess bureaucracy. The end result is undercutting on the markets, either in European or Third World markets, but the greater fear is rationalisation. Ten or 15 years ago &ndash; ten years ago certainly &ndash; the dairy industry and the major players in that industry were always saying that there was only room for three major dairy co-ops. Some of the smaller co-ops are as independent and as good as any of the major players. A certain amount of rationalisation is, however, needed within the industry, but how to go about it is another day's work.</P>
    <P>We see skulduggery within the industry from the primary producer up to the processor. Over the years hormones have been found in beef, which is akin to national sabotage. It is putting one of our major industries at risk, and those who are involved in it or who take part in hormone production have no place within Irish farming or agriculture.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about breeding. I have gone, over the years, to many farm meetings throughout north Cork. At least two to three times a year the dairy societies &ndash; Dairygold or some of the other independent AI societies &ndash; have had meetings or discussion groups on breeding within the dairy industry. If one goes to any of these agricultural meetings, one finds that farmers are attending them and questioning the various expert groups or the people involved to get more information on how to raise animals that produce top quality milk with high protein, high butterfat etc. Our side of the country might not be traditionally a beef producing area but I have very seldom, if ever, seen a farmers' meeting billed as the future of the beef industry or the future of the suckler herd in terms of giving information on the type of animal that should be produced to get the best results. A strong emphasis should be put on the fact that all the parties have to meet and agree that the price per pound that one gets for quality beef is most important. It has to start at the basics, with the breeding, and work up. There is an incentive in the agriculture industry at farm level to believe that quality is the way forward. That has been done in the dairy industry and it can be done in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>People say that if one has in excess of seven acres of land &ndash; the actual criteria is a lease or ownership &ndash; one qualifies as a farmer, that one can just get a few cattle and let them run around, but farming is a very technically oriented, expert business. It has to be constantly researched and developed if its players at all levels are to progress. Since cattle forms were introduced in 1992, there has been much form filling to be done, which started with the headage grants introduced <Col N="764" /> in EU laws in the 1970s. Farmers, especially beef producing farmers, have a number of forms to fill in each year. Before the end of this week they must complete the new extensification form. With new regulations, they have to be constantly updated. It can be seen at the various meetings countrywide that farmers are gathering to get more information.</P>
    <P>Today's farming section in the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a heading implying that if the form was not filled in correctly or was not issued before Friday &ndash; this is the first type of this form &ndash; a 100% penalty would be imposed. The regulations have been introduced but there must be greater flexibility within the system. I know we must have rules and some farmers were not the best at adhering to them in the past which is why penalties are strict. However, farmers should be treated fairly. They are becoming more accustomed to filling in forms. They are as entitled to make mistakes as anybody else. As a public representative, I deal with other Departments which accept forms throughout the year. There should be greater flexibility for farmers in this regard.</P>
    <P>The introduction of intervention for EU beef reduced the incentive to market our beef. The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who has responsibility for food, has made great strides in marketing our products since he took office two and a half years ago. At meetings in my constituency he has always said our beef is as good as that of other countries, if we make the effort and deliver on it. Intervention has provided a safety net but it has also meant that we did not have to vigorously market our beef.</P>
    <P>We cannot discuss this Bill without mentioning the farmers' dispute with the meat factories which was triggered by the imposition of the veterinary levy. Farmers have been frustrated by events of the past few years. When prices were okay they did not take action. However, there was always a suspicion, raised at farmers' meetings, that meat factories were operating a cartel in some shape or form. They were watching prices and ensuring nobody was 1p or 2p above them. The frustration at the pickets on meat factories was heartfelt. The IFA members were frustrated with the lack of action. I welcome the resolution of the dispute. For the first time in a number of years, it gave farmers a sense of achievement. They had an idea that agriculture was not being best served by what was happening between meat factories and, to give them their dues, they brought about a resolution.</P>
    <P>I spoke about penalties and the bureaucracy of the appeals system. Some of the appeals mechanisms are failing. Farmers can lodge an appeal and go through six months of filling out forms, with the same outcome as when they started. This builds up their hopes. Like any other industry, farmers should have a representative at an appeal hearing who can fight their case.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing debate about the difference between the price received by the primary beef, lamb or pigmeat producer and that paid by <Col N="765" /> the consumer over the counter. This matter must be looked at as it is causing serious concern. This is more evident in the sheep sector where lambs are being sold at mart for £25 or £30 while a leg of lamb can cost £15 or £20. This is a huge difference. I know the Departments involved are examining what can be done about this. This has been a problem for a long time. I remember at the height of the depression in beef prices in autumn 1998 when family butchers cut the price of beef by 25%. After a short time, the furore died down and there was no incentive to continue cutting prices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the initiative to impose some law and order in our beef industry. The Bill should be welcomed by farmers and consumers if it raises the standards of our beef and agriculture. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1990s will be remembered as an important time for beef. We started the 1990s with the beef tribunal and in 1994 the former Chief Justice, Mr. Hamilton, reported that there were many defects in meat processing plants. As the 1990s concluded, we began the millennium with the meat factory blockades, which was a defining moment for the beef industry. Until then, there was always tension between the urban population and farmers because of a lack of appreciation of the low prices received by farmers. The dispute exposed to urban dwellers the prices farmers were receiving from factories. They began to look at what they were paying in the butchers and found there was a huge difference. They appreciated farmers were not getting a fair deal.</P>
      <P>In today's farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i> I saw for the first time a list of some of the meat processing units &ndash; not all of them &ndash; and the different grades and prices. Most people would like to see an extension of this, as was promised recently. We must encourage accountability and transparency in the industry. There should be a league table similar to that for milk producers which appears in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.</P>
      <P>Sometimes when the Tánaiste returns from a foreign trip, as was the case on this occasion, she is not up to speed with what is happening. This could be seen on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;  when she incorrectly gauged the public mood as regards the budget. Her choice of words regarding the beef dispute was unfortunate. She more or less defined farmers as anarchists when she said a state of anarchy prevailed. This did not go down well with farmers. Farmers cannot be described as anarchists. Their actions should be contrasted with those of European farmers, particularly those in France who often use what we would regard as anarchic methods to fight for their rights. The dispute here was a peaceful blockade in the interests of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is important for the beef industry as it includes many positive measures, including traceability. One must admire Feargal Quinn of <Col N="766" /> Superquinn on his approach regarding identification, traceability and ensuring that the consumer is aware of the origin of meat. Consumers have become more discerning. This is important in relation to the Food Safety Authority and the recent appointment of David Byrne. Some people were sceptical when he was first appointed that he might not be as serious a player as some other commissioners. However, given the way in which things are evolving in Europe, including this country, and the awareness of consumers in relation to food safety, this is becoming an extremely important brief. There will be many developments in the area of food safety in the next few years. We all appreciate this because at the end of the day one must recognise that the consumer is king. That is the importance of a Bill such as this. The onus for this will rest with the farmers but everyone will be accepted until such time as the inspection process is completed. I would like to hear from Department officials how long the inspection process will take. Is a timeframe envisaged? Will it take one, two or three years or just six months to inspect all farms involved in beef production?</P>
    <P>I endorse many of the concerns raised by my colleagues regarding aspects of the appeals procedure. Sometimes there is a lack of consciousness within the Department regarding the fact that many elderly farmers may have left primary school with a very basic education. Many farmers find the amount of paperwork and the level of bureaucracy intimidating. Some elderly farmers may not present their application forms for area aid to the Department on the basis that the area has not changed. It is interesting that when a farmer makes an error he is penalised. However, I saw a letter recently from a member of the area aid unit in response to a query from Teagasc on behalf of a farmer. When I contacted him, he apologised for mislaying the original letter he received. It is interesting that officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development can just apologise for their mistakes while a 70 year old man who did not send in his area aid form is penalised, even though he made a mistake. There is a lack of give and take in this situation. It is understandable that Department officials must be cautious not to put their job on the line because nowadays European Union auditors can come in and inspect files at random. However, there is a difference between attempted fraud and a genuine mistake. Those involved in the appeals process tend to have a very detached view. I am critical of the appeals process, which is very impersonal in that someone in Dublin tries to adjudicate in the case of a person living in Limerick.</P>
    <P>In relation to food safety and traceability, I read recently that Irish beef was to be labelled as European Union beef. What is the logic in this, given that we are supposed to have the best beef in the world? We like our beef to be sold as Irish beef in Germany, France and throughout the Continent. The Minister was in Italy recently pro<Col N="767" /> moting Irish beef. What is the reason for classifying our beef as European Union beef? How is the debate progressing and when will this take place? The Minister of State has a great interest in all aspects of farming. There is mention of extending food safety controls in relation to pig and poultry processing and so on. If one is dealing with Tesco, the broiler unit will be inspected by Tesco officials in order to determine that it is satisfactory. Various veterinary people are along the slaughter line in the factory unit. This means the consumer can be assured of the quality of the Irish poultry product, yet there are massive imports from other European countries. As Europeans, we must accept this but there is also a massive amount of imports from non-European countries.</P>
    <P>Thailand is the fifth largest poultry producing country in the world. I am concerned about the procedures that are in place regarding products from non-EU countries which may not have the same health and safety controls in place as we have. I read with interest a report published last year by a group of veterinarians who travelled to Thailand from the UK to inspect the different units in that country and to get a feel for the product and the conditions under which it is produced. That report listed a number of criticisms. Do our veterinary surgeons ever travel outside of Ireland to determine the quality of the products coming into this country? A lot of produce is imported into Europe and transferred to this country. Fortunately, much of the produce is going into an industry where it is cooked well and the consumer is happy.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about labelling our meat as European Union beef. If a person goes into a supermarket, be it Dunnes or Roches Stores, and picks up a portion of poultry, he or she is entitled to know whether it has come from Thailand, the Ivory Coast, France, Belgium or Ireland. Consumers can then make up their mind. However, at present in many cases consumers are not aware of the origin of the product.</P>
    <P>If the issue of food safety is to be taken further, we must take positive steps to ensure the safety of products being imported into the country. Very often there is just a routine inspection carried out. This beef document is important. However, one wonders if the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will police and monitor this process or will this end at a certain point? Will responsibility for the produce be held by the Food Safety Authority or the Department of Health and Children? Perhaps there would be a lot more emphasis if the Department of Health and Children monitored the process from the farmyard gate to the consumer? Would this lead to a better policing system? I am aware that the inspection of farms would have to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but this could be carried out under the guidance of the Department of Health <Col N="768" /> and Children. It would be better if one Department dealt with the whole issue of food safety in terms of beef and so on. However, we must accept the proposals from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the IFA and the ICMSA have indicated their acceptance of this proposal. I wish the Bill well in its passage through this House. It is very important that we cater for the consumer as king. It is important to ensure improvement in food quality and safety.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party tabled this motion to confront what has been the Government's greatest failure since taking office. I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to his new portfolio and wish him well. Welcome as he is, what the health services need more than anything is not a new face but a new direction.</P>
      <P>On the day of the Minister's appointment, a woman was interviewed on the RTE news at 9 o'clock. Adele Murtagh is an ordinary member of the public, yet her story tells more about the failure of the Government than any list of statistics possibly could. Six months ago her mother was diagnosed as having fluid on the brain. She has been on a priority list for surgery ever since, but the long wait has weakened her to the point where she is too ill to undergo surgery. Care for that woman comes too late. At a time of such prosperity it is incredible that our modern health service cannot deliver treatment to someone so desperately in need of care. However, what is insupportable is that were Adele's mother a private patient she would have had her operation in time.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about this &ndash; Adele's case, tragically, is not unique. There are patients dying as they wait for treatment or for whom treatment is so long coming their lives are shortened dramatically. That is the reality of a health service which is not working for many thousands of people. The Labour Party's determination in tabling this motion is to drive forward the change that will meet the health needs of all citizens. If the chronic problems besetting the sick and those availing of our hospital services, in particular, and those who provide those services are to be addressed, there must be a radical, root and branch reform.</P>
      <P>Reform is needed because the current system is failing so many. The hospital system is characterised by instability, inequality and inefficiencies. When it comes under seasonal pressures, as we saw recently, patients suffer needlessly and terribly as a result of Government inaction. Regardless of whether they are public or private patients, the misery suffered by patients in overcrowded accident and emergency units is the same. It is profoundly disturbing that sick and elderly people have to wait many hours for assessment or have to wait on a trolley or in a wheelchair for days before accessing a bed or being sent home without the necessary back-up care. That would be unacceptable in a society with a modest level of economic growth, but in one like ours that has world beating economic growth rates it is an obscenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On radio last night the Taoiseach said it was ridiculous that we are top of the OECD growth league, yet we do not have national stadium and that he intends to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to provide one. I have never heard the Taoiseach speak with such passion about the need for a decent, good quality health service. I have not heard him say once that since our econ<Col N="770" /> omic growth is so good he will build a health service on the twin principles of excellence and equality. On the need to create a health service capable of meeting the urgent needs of thousands of people, the Taoiseach has nothing to say.</P>
    <P>The health service is in real trouble. The stark fact is that while there has been approximately a 45% increase in health funding, the crisis continues to grow in our hospitals and the waiting lists lengthen inexorably. In its programme for the millennium the Government undertook to tackle waiting lists. In its mid-term review it promised to tackle waiting lists. On taking up his new portfolio the Minister yet again promised to tackle waiting lists. Yet, since taking office, despite all the promises and despite the surge in Exchequer funding, while it is difficult to know the up to date figures, the latest figures show that the Government has succeeded in adding at least an extra 5,200 people to the waiting lists with the total number moving towards 40,000. These are the people on the waiting lists &ndash; we are not talking about those who are on a waiting list to get on to these waiting lists. Despite the increased funding fewer cardiac surgery procedures were carried out nationally in 1998 than were carried out two years previously. In the Mater hospital alone the figure was down by around 20%.</P>
    <P>There are 391 patients waiting to attend the pain clinic in St. Vincent's hospital. These are people whose suffering is so great that normal treatment has failed to assuage it. Even for this last resort type of care, there is a waiting list. Over Christmas in one hospital the position was so bad there was a waiting list to get into the morgue. When the position has deteriorated to this level it is tempting for an Opposition party to simply catalogue the disasters and leave them to fester at the Government's door, but reform of our health services requires fresh thinking and an intelligent, imaginative approach. The Labour Party is committed to providing the leadership that is required to meet that challenge.</P>
    <P>In this context, we framed this motion in the form of a twin track approach. First, we must ensure a significant increase in health care investment. Whatever funding the Government puts into health must be measured by the yardstick that applies across the EU. Ireland has the fastest growth rate and a reported <i>per capita</i> income higher even than Germany's. Yet, when it comes to the percentage of our GDP spent on health, Ireland is at the bottom of the league. Germany spends approximately 10%, Britain spends approximately 8%, yet Ireland's percentage has plummeted during the Government's term of office. In 1997 it dropped from more than 7.3% to 5.3% and it is now at 5.5%, which is remarkably low in European terms.</P>
    <P>While Government investment in health care is not enough, it is not effective in terms of measured health outcomes. We have the highest death rate in the EU from cardiovascular disease and to date our cancer services in terms of outcomes do not compare favourably with other EU <Col N="771" /> countries. We are near the bottom of the list with Britain. The chance of a person's survival in Ireland once he or she has been diagnosed is a direct reflection of the underdevelopment of our cancer services.</P>
    <P>Most complaints Members hear from their constituents relate to accident and emergency units. These units are the gateway for most patients to our hospital services and it is where the greatest pressure is evident. We know that greater resources at general practice level in terms of training, resources and beds in low-tech local units will reduce significantly the attendance at A&amp;E units. That is well known, yet the increase in funding in general practice in 2000 is insignificant &ndash; it is less than inflation. We also know that more than 200 acute hospital beds at any time in the Eastern Health Board region are inappropriately occupied because the Government has not resolved the shortage of step-down beds and has not put in place the necessary supports for the elderly in the community. We know A&amp;E units would provide a better and a faster service if they were fully staffed by A&amp;E consultants, yet there are only 18 such consultants in the country and the majority of A&amp;E units have none. Doctors in training deal with emergency cases in a way that often leads to inefficiencies and overuse of diagnostic facilities. Our young doctors are overworked, our nurses are alienated and we are not appointing enough consultants. Most importantly, we are not moving significantly towards a consultant provided service and away from a consultant led one.</P>
    <P>Is it that we care less about our sick and elderly than other Europeans? I do not think so. Is it that we do not have a tradition of excellence in health care, the infrastructure for it or the educational capability? Hardly. What is lacking is political courage. The idea that because we are wealthier today we should spend less proportionately on our health services is one the Government is satisfied to promote, but it is not shared by the public who are bewildered at the state of our health services. Undoubtedly, the Minister will list figures when he speaks later &ndash; sometimes Ministers count them twice &ndash; but this is meaningless if at the end of the day we are not investing in a way that establishes once and for all stability, equality and efficiency in our hospital services.</P>
    <P>We have excellent people working in health care who draw on a fine tradition. Yet the service provided for the elderly and less well off has been christened a Mickey Mouse service not by an Opposition Member keen to score points, but by a leading consultant physician. As recently as 10 January, 30 patients spent the night on trolleys in the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont Hospital, which is a flagship hospital. Ennis General Hospital had one third more patients than it had capacity for and there were 162 patients in the 129 bed Limerick Regional Hospital. In many hospitals elective cases were cancelled and <Col N="772" /> patients were added to the waiting list over that period. According to the Department of Health and Children, there was no flu epidemic. This is disputed but if it is true, one can imagine what havoc a flu epidemic would have caused.</P>
    <P>Propping up an inherently unstable system by blindly injecting it with more money will not change the fact that it is a system caught between a long-standing chronic lack of resources on the inside and ineffective attempts to control unmet demand through waiting lists on the outside. The current two-tier system of unequal access is virtually in-built into the structural interdependence of public and private care. Public budgets depend on a certain number of people paying for their own care, although they are entitled to it already. The fact that the same personnel and facilities are used to treat public and private patients is often seen as an advantage in terms of consultant care.</P>
    <P>The adverse incentive within such a system, however, lies with forcing greater numbers into taking out more private insurance. In effect, the longer the waiting list, the greater the potential income from fee-paying clients. It creates a serious problem in cost containment in that, other than the professional and humanitarian impulse among professionals, there is little impetus for consultants to treat a greater number of public patients. Without the advantage of accessing care there would be little incentive for subscribers to take out insurance. Yet, without it our public system would be so encumbered as to be rendered inoperative.</P>
    <P>The central challenge, as the Labour Party sees it, is to progress beyond the current system not by eliminating the advantages provided by health insurance but by ensuring that those advantages are extended to all our citizens. We have no interest in or desire to re-apportion scarcity more thinly. That would be pointless and extremely damaging to our health services. We recognise that health funding in Ireland is not drawn from bottomless sources, but we are also keenly aware that we have a historic opportunity to transform our health service to meet the needs of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>In education, the area for which the Minister previously had responsibility, the principle of equality was established by previous Governments. We take it for granted that all children have a right to good quality education regardless of whether their parents can pay. The same principle needs to be established in health. Placing greater value on health means establishing equal access to quality care as a fundamental right. It means introducing legislation to protect that right and appropriate funding and structural change to bring it about. Some 42% of the population already pays private health insurance while 58% does not pay for such insurance. We must work from that basis and move on to deal with the deficiencies as we see them. It is clear that the best way to develop a fully comprehensive system which provides primary and secondary care is to <Col N="773" /> introduce, or at least set about introducing, a universal health insurance system.</P>
    <P>A properly designed universal health insurance system will ensure the stability of the system as well as equality within the system which are lacking at present. It will also create a dynamic which hospitals are denied because of the strict budgetary controls that exist at present which lead to closed wards and blocked beds. There are many models to which we can look, particularly in the European Union where insurance based systems are standard and where equality and excellence are established principles. The system we are proposing would marry the benefits of State financing and regulation, which are vital to ensure universality, social solidarity and equity, and the benefits of consumer choice and competition, which has the power to enhance quality and cost effectiveness within our health system.</P>
    <P>The State would have a central role in planning the system, defining cover of care, acting as a regulator and ensuring that those who cannot afford to pay themselves are looked after, in part or totally, as well as providing necessary capital. The Labour Party will soon publish its proposals for such a universal health insurance system. We are doing so because we are deeply committed to the transformation of our health service. We are conscious that it is in everyone's interest that a new initiative is taken to overcome the deficiencies and faults in our current system. If they are not confronted, they will not only impact on public patients but on those who are already beginning to experience problems within the private sphere in terms of costs and waiting times.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is in Opposition, it is limited in terms of resources and we do not claim to have all the answers. Even if we thought we had them, we would still want to engage with the public and all the key players in the health services. We want to open up the public debate in a way that confronts the necessity for radical reform. Equality must be a fundamental guiding principle in access to health care for every individual, regardless of income, geographic location or social status, and excellence must be the measure of the quality of that care. I am convinced that universal health insurance is the key that can deliver both as long as such a system is properly designed and formulated.</P>
    <P>We cannot fulfil the task on our own. My party's approach is open-ended to ensure that all the key players in our health services, including patients, are involved in the debate that can lead to a fully comprehensive policy. In the Department of Education and Science, the Minister worked within a system where the principles of equality and excellence were already well established. The challenge now presented to him by my party is to bring about those principles in our health care services.</P>
    <P>A senior cancer specialist recently described our health system, in comparison to other European systems, as clearly and measurably deficient and characterised by profound intrinsic structural <Col N="774" /> flaws. He argued for a universal health insurance based system, and the Labour Party agrees with him. Our position is clear about the way forward. We have a world-class economy, it is time we had a world-class health service. I also wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Caoláin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my party tabled this important motion on the health services. The Labour Party feels strongly about the health system and the Minister will hear much from us about it. The purpose of the motion is not only to remind the Government that the health system has deteriorated to a level where people cannot afford to pay for essential treatment and are being forced to do without it, but also to remind them that we are now in a position to make choices about how our health system develops. We are in a position to ensure that no one, regardless of income, is forced to suffer or face fatal consequences because our health services are inadequate or incapable of catering for their needs.</P>
      <P>The Government can decide if we should pump more money into tax reductions, thereby increasing privately held wealth, or improving essential universal services. Health is obviously one of the most important services. Given the growing length of waiting lists, the Government to date has embarked on a mission to improve private wealth, particularly among those who are already wealthy, and to minimise health spending. The burden of taxation in Ireland is low by EU standards but the percentage of total taxation paid by PAYE workers is high.</P>
      <P>The decision in the recent budget to give huge breaks to those liable for capital gains tax is indicative of the Government's approach to taxation. However, those whose incomes are derived from profits and property also have been given many opportunities to minimise their tax bills. As a result of exempting so much income from taxation, the burden on the PAYE sector and the low paid is excessive. There are few low and middle income earners who would trade fully accessible world class facilities for an extra few pounds per week in income tax concessions. They understand that an extra few pounds per week in after tax income will not buy them faster access to medical treatment or pay for increasingly expensive private health insurance. Should their child be mentally or physically handicapped it will not buy a place in long-term or respite care. Only increased public expenditure will improve many aspects of the living standards of ordinary workers. It is clear that the highest living standards in the EU are enjoyed in the countries with the highest level of public spending. That may hit a raw nerve somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While overall public spending in Ireland is low, spending on health care as a percentage of GDP has uniquely, in the EU, been declining. In 1985 Ireland ranked fifth in the EU on health spending as a percentage of GDP. We have since declined <Col N="775" /> to 11th place and only three member states, the UK &ndash; the Labour Government is trying to reverse the awful trend in Britain &ndash; Luxembourg and Greece spend a smaller proportion of their GDP on health than us. Ireland is one of only four EU states which spends less than 7% of GDP on health. These figures show that spending on health care in Ireland is not excessive by any standards. It is hardly surprising that we have up to 40,000 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment and that some public patients have to wait five months for an appointment with a dermatologist, eight months for an appointment with an ophthalmologist and six months for an appointment with a gynaecologist while those in need of hip operations have to wait two or more years to be called.</P>
    <P>I turn to the issues that affect real people on the ground. In a written reply to me on 26 January, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen, indicated that at the end of September 1999 the total number waiting to be called for treatment in the various specialties in the Midland Health Board area was 2,108. This figure is an indictment of the abject failure of the Government to ensure that the people who need attention and seek those vital specialties such as ENT, orthopaedics and vascular surgery are left to suffer and their condition deteriorate. This is a rerun of the old saying in my part of the country, the poor can suffer and wait. It is an absolute shame, at a time of plenty when the Government boasts about its £6 billion in the coffers, that ordinary people with a medical card have to wait while their health deteriorates.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine the pain and debilitation suffered by a person awaiting a hip replacement operation? What level of deterioration is associated with more than a two-year wait for such an operation? One of those on such a list is Robbie McAuley. A woman in her seventies came to see me in my village of Ballynacargy. She asked how she could borrow the money to get into hospital and how much it would cost. I said it would probably cost £5,000. She said she could raise £2,000 and that if she got in they would have to keep her. I advised her to go ahead and told her I would be with her if they put the law on her. I told her to borrow the money from the credit union, to stay in that hospital bed and squat if necessary. In the name of God, it is time a concerted attempt was made to ensure people have to wait no longer than a maximum of six months for those vital operations.</P>
    <P>I come to a local question about which I will be on the Minister's tail. It involves the equipping, staffing and fitting out of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. I am proud to have beside me Deputy Howlin a former Minister for Health who continued the great Labour Party tradition of providing essential services. Another former Minister, Barry Desmond, provided the funding for phase 2A. Some £25 million has been spent on this hospital development to date and <Col N="776" /> another £12 million is all that is required to complete it. Why can this money not be provided immediately? It is abundantly clear the amount required is less than 0.75% of the budget surplus of £2 billion. It is vitally important that this work is completed, staff is provided and 260 medical beds are provided on completion. Based on the outbreak of flu during the Christmas period these medical beds cannot be provided too soon. Mullingar hospital which has 50 medical beds had 130 medical patients in mid-January, an occupancy rate of 220%, while we have an empty shell. The people of Westmeath and Longford are angry. I am with them 100% and will ensure this job is completed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time with me and congratulate her on presenting this Labour Party motion to the House. I draw attention to the kinds of cases which are being brought to my attention by my constituents not for particular action on their own behalf but because they want these issues raised to ensure that nobody else has to endure the same suffering. For example, a woman who contacted me gets a routine mammography examination every two years. The consultant radiologist in a particular hospital wrote to her as follows:</P>
      <P>Your doctor has written to us requesting an appointment for screening and routine mammography. Unfortunately, our appointments for mammography are filled by patients considered to be at high risk of breast cancer. We have written to your doctor informing him of the above. Please contact him again if you are worried that you might have breast cancer.</P>
      <P>This is no way to run a screening service. This woman wanted this issue raised so that the matter would be addressed not on her behalf but on behalf of all patients.</P>
      <P>There is the case of an elderly man who is now deceased. In the advanced stage of illness he was brought to a hospital by ambulance at 7 p.m. and not seen by a doctor until 10.15 p.m. His niece wrote to me as follows:</P>
      <P>If this was not bad enough we were then told that they had no bed for him. He could stay in casualty where he was but there was no bed in a ward. At over six feet in height, his feet were hanging off the edge of the trolley. He had been given injections by the GP for pain but she wanted him to be in the hospital so that he would be comfortable. Instead he was brought back home by the same two ambulance men who brought him in and I was handed suppositories with rubber gloves and gel if he had pain. This had to be the final insult. I would really appreciate if you could do something to ensure that this never happens again. It is too late for my uncle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give examples of numerous cases of children waiting for orthodontic care, elderly patients waiting for geriatric treatment and elderly people <Col N="777" /> who, because they have a small occupational pension, are denied a medical card and are afraid to visit the doctor because of the cost element.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address one issue of health care that affects my constituency. We want a proper regional general hospital located in Loughlinstown. There are large general hospitals ringed around the city &ndash; Beaumont, Blanchardstown and Tallaght. In the southern end of Dublin, the motorway ring as it will be, there is no general hospital. There is no general and regional hospital between St. Vincent's Hospital and Wexford town. People from Wicklow and north Wexford travel to what is a small district hospital in Loughlinstown for care. In an area with a growing population and huge needs, that is no longer acceptable. I ask the Minister to address this matter and take this opportunity to congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, my constituency colleague, who I have no doubt will advance this case in her Department. We want a proper regional general hospital located in Loughlinstown to provide a better quality of service for the people in that general area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>The cost containment culture which was fostered by the cost efficiency drive launched in the period 1987-92, in particular, during the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government of that period is unfortunately still the overriding determinant of health policy. There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> when one hears constituents tell of the length of time people must wait for desperately needed operations. Once again the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is delivering this cost containment culture in a way which is brutally harsh on our constituents.</P>
      <P>When a medical practitioner is put under pressure to resign when he resists the Department of Health and Children's drive to reduce bed occupancy times, as recently happened in the Lourdes Hospital, the reason cited was failure to follow agreed budgetary guidelines. If that is the case, then the Department of Health and Children is still stuck in the 1980s mind set. Unfortunately with a significant increase in the working population, which should be seen as the basis on which to increase the level of <i>per capita</i> health expenditure in real terms, we are still witnessing this 1987-92 culture.</P>
      <P>As my colleagues, Deputies McManus and Penrose, stated earlier, recently there was astonishment in the United Kingdom at the proportion of national income spent on health compared to that spent elsewhere in Europe, but Ireland's expenditure on health is in the same bottom of the league class despite the fact that the economy is surging towards the top of the league. This is something which the new Minister, Deputy Martin, should address urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants to guarantee a quality health service, it requires an increase in the quality of service delivered to the public patient <i>via</i> the Exchequer and the social insurance system. This <Col N="778" /> will allow the insurance funded private health cover to remain affordable to an increasing number of workers as real incomes rise. The increasing workforce provides a unique opportunity for the new Minister.</P>
    <P>The way in which the health system has evolved in recent years is systematic of a Government which has lost real contact with people. The people in my constituency are still struggling to sustain decent livelihoods in an economy where the right to housing has become a thing of the past and the right to basic health services is only accessible to those who can pay. The man or woman who spends his or her entire working life paying taxes and contributing to the social insurance fund is finding out that he or she must wait two, three, four or even five years for essential operations and treatment.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency, much of which is working class, where the people do not have private health insurance and did not think they ought to have it, because they pay their stamps and understood that their health needs could be catered for through the public health system. However, that public health system is on the brink of collapse, as the Minister, Deputy Martin, takes over the Department. He should be aware that the failure of the health services to meet basic demands is one of the biggest scandals of the roaring economy.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the arrogant reply which his predecessor gave to my colleague, Deputy McManus, at Question Time last November. When she rightly criticised him for the 40,000 people on the in-patient waiting lists, the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated that journalists should sometimes recognise that individuals have a vested interest in suggesting that the numbers are higher than they are in an attempt to obtain more funds for their members and are not as objective as they claim to be. What on earth is that supposed to mean? Instead of dealing with an outstanding major problem, he sought to shift the blame to journalists, administrators and health board officials.</P>
    <P>My constituency mail bag, like those of my colleagues, is full to the brim of incredible accounts of people's experiences in hospital. Recently I received correspondence from distressed patients of my local hospital, Beaumont Hospital, who informed me that, on admission, they have been consigned to trolleys on public corridors for days. Others were shifted from bed, to chair and back to bed again, and spent more than two days in their dressing-gown in the middle of the accident and emergency department. How can the Government stand over a situation where such constituents are waiting many years for an essential artery bypass operation? Where is the comfort for them in the arrogance which was shown only last November by the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, who denied in effect that there was a crisis.</P>
    <P>I also wish to bring the attention of the Minister, Deputy Martin, to an issue which was raised <Col N="779" /> last year regarding one of the hospitals in my constituency, that is, the situation at St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny. When it was faced with closure, and patients and 130 jobs were at risk in the argument between two multi-national companies, one of which owned the hospital and the other of which owned the service provision, neither the Minister's predecessor nor the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, would take responsibility. Each of them stated that it had nothing to do with them. Therefore, one of the issues at the top of the Minister's agenda might be the regulation of the private hospital industry.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McManus and her Labour Party colleagues for the opportunity to record my support for the motion. A year ago I opposed the motion of confidence in the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. At that time I joined other Members in deploring the desperate situation in the hospitals as waiting lists grew and as patients faced delays which were damaging their health.</P>
      <P>If anything, the situation has deteriorated since then. Since the vote of confidence in February 1999, there has been the nurses strike, which was one of the gravest situations ever faced by the health service. The massive public support for the nurses was a vote of no confidence by the people in the Government's management of the health services. It was a scandal that the nurses should have had to strike at all. What greater service can any person give than to care for the ill, the elderly and the infirm. This service deserves the fullest possible remuneration. The failure over many years to properly remunerate the nurses is central to the grave problems now afflicting the health services, including long waiting lists, closed wards and state of the art surgical facilities in some locations which cannot be used.</P>
      <P>Nurses and other health professionals have been leaving the public health system. There continues to be a disincentive to young people to enter the nursing profession, seeing as they do the inhuman working hours and pressurised conditions faced by nursing staff in the hospitals and also the attractions of employment in other sectors. While the resolution of the nurses' strike may have addressed this to a certain extent, the shortage of nurses is still causing daily crises in the hospitals. Only last week student nurses had to demonstrate outside Leinster House to demand the abolition of the £2,500 fee for their fourth year of nursing studies and the payment of a subsistence grant. These students are discriminated against and here we have another disincentive to young people taking up careers in nursing. I urge the new Minister, Deputy Martin, to address this without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A glaring example of the flawed approach to the health services by the Government was the dictatorial decision of the outgoing Minister, Deputy Cowen, to restrict the medicinal herb, St. <Col N="780" /> John's Wort. Account was not taken of the thousands of people who used the product safely and beneficially, nor was account taken of the growing herbal medicine sector. This decision can only benefit the large multi-national pharmaceutical companies who seek to monopolise health care. I urge the new Minister, Deputy Martin, to address this issue urgently and respond to the needs and the reasonable expectations of people throughout the State by reversing that decision.</P>

      <P>Another priority for the new Minister, Deputy Martin, must be the dangerous situation with regard to HIV and AIDS. I hope this is not nearly as humorous for the Minister as the last point I raised. As recently as Sunday the director of the HIV/AIDS support group, Cairde, stated that the Eastern Health Board, where 90% of cases occur, has no real HIV strategy. A new national strategy is promised and this must be expedited. Some 38% of infections are caused by intravenous drug abuse and this highlights the failure of successive Governments to provide proper treatment and continuing after care for drug abusers, and to tackle the heroin problem and the climate of social exclusion in which it thrives. Tonight my colleague councillors in Dublin are attending a remembrance service for the young people in this city who have perished and continue to perish every week in the heroin holocaust.</P>
      <P>I am glad the motion concludes with positive proposals, which I endorse totally, and I urge the Minister, Deputy Martin, whom I have already sincerely wished well in his new post, to take them on board and not make narrow or particular political capital. These are important issues of which I know the Minister is cognisant. I ask him to adopt a new and positive approach which can provide the people with the health service which they need and certainly deserve.</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>(a)welcomes the substantial increase in capital and revenue resources that are being committed by this Government to the development of acute hospitals and all other aspects of the health services;</P>
      <P>(b)commends the significant progress that is being made in developing services through a comprehensive series of strategic initiatives in areas such as cancer services and cardiovascular disease;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> (c)endorses the Government's ongoing strategy of dealing with waiting lists and waiting times in a structured, co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary manner, involving all relevant aspects of the health system; and</P>
    <P>(d)welcomes the intention of the Minister for Health and Children to continue to progress the development of a quality-based, patient-focused, well managed and closely integrated service for acute hospital users.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity, so soon after my appointment, to address the House on a vital element of the Government's health policy. I particularly welcome this as an opportunity to outline the way that I believe we should be talking about the future of our health services. One element of this has to be to confront the Opposition with the basic fact that the Government has already put in place a range of programme improvements and funding expansion, which means that today there are more people being treated by the health services, there are more people employed in the health services and there are more capital projects under way than at any time in the history of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that we have a health service which is responsive and effective in meeting the needs of our people. To achieve this one needs a balanced programme and more funding to tackle structural difficulties. Most of all, one needs to realise that if the answers appear simple, then one does not understand the questions. As public policy makers it falls to us to try to develop a constructive debate on all the issues. Ignoring advances, simplifying problems and endlessly grasping at headlines does nothing to help an individual receive better care.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Opposition has shown itself determined to roar &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; at every opportunity and to pretend that nothing is being done. This is highly ironic, given that this Government replaced one whose health policy was characterised by complacency and which actually implemented a cutback in the only dedicated programme designed to tackle public waiting lists.</P>
    <P>If one was to take much of the Opposition's attack seriously, one would have to believe that the Government is responsible for every problem common to almost every health system in the western world. We are not responsible for medical inflation in America, 'flu in Britain and waiting lists in Holland. However, we are responsible for unprecedented increases in funding, for hiring more health professionals and for recognising that as a country we need a balanced and ambitious programme to address long-standing problems in the health service.</P>

This said, we not only have a record of which we can be proud, but we also have policies which can address the problems we continue to face.</P>
      <P>We have to get some things straight. The number of people now benefiting from treatment in the acute hospital sector is greater than ever before. Contrary to the impression the Opposition wants to give, the acute hospital system treated 25,000 more patients on an in-patient or day-case basis during 1998, than in 1997. Similarly, over 18,000 more patients were treated in accident and emergency departments, and over 50,000 more patients were seen at out-patient level than in 1997.</P>
      <P>This trend in overall activity continued during 1999. During the first nine months of the year, overall discharges, in-patient and day-cases were up by over 4% on the same period in 1998. Crucial to this has been the Government's major programme for renewing and developing health services throughout the country. The OECD recently reported that the performance of the system measures up very well by international comparison.</P>
      <P>In spite of these advances we are not complacent. We have provided a very solid basis for further developments. My predecessor as Minister, Deputy Cowen, was responsible for a number of substantial initiatives in the acute hospital sector, which will achieve measurable progress in reforming, reorganising and properly gearing the system to meet the needs of our population. He recently outlined these in detail. They include the cardiovascular health strategy which is aimed at achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease &ndash; the full cost of this will be £150 million; the investment of £14 million since 1998 in cardiac services, including cardiac surgery, to support the objectives of the wider cardiovascular strategy; the national cancer strategy which is already improving the availability of cancer treatment services throughout the country &ndash; a total of £34 million has been invested in the strategy under the present Government; the establishment of a medical manpower forum to review key aspects of medical staffing in public hospitals, which impinge in a fundamental way on the quality of service provided to the public; a range of other initiatives in such areas as acute hospital governance and management development, clinicians in management, laboratory accreditation and health technology assessment, and the implementation of a co-ordinated waiting list initiative, which I will return to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition parties like to try to give an impression of cutbacks &ndash; an unequivocal and deliberate distortion of the fact that the level and breadth of our increased funding of the health service dwarfs that of the Government they were involved in less than three years ago. Through a <Col N="783" /> combination of the normal Estimates process and the national development plan, we have provided resources which will help to renew and develop health services in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, £2 billion has been earmarked for health care which will enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, the elderly, the mentally ill and children in need of care and protection. The plan also provides for investment in health centres and in information technology.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger that the priorities for spending in the health system can be unduly influenced by those who shout loudest or are the most sophisticated lobbyists. While the acute hospital sector and related areas of the services tend to loom large in the public consciousness, the major progress this Government is making in the development of services for the intellectually disabled, is both badly needed and widely welcomed. The ongoing development of services to meet the identified needs of this group has been a top priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Total additional revenue funding of £38.7 million is being provided this year, increasing to £45.7 million next January. This funding will provide, at a minimum, over 550 new residential places, almost 200 new respite places, 700 new day places, health related support services for persons with autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    <P>This is the largest single new revenue investment ever made in the health services. The comparative amount for new developments provided by the previous Government in 1997 was less than one quarter of this figure. Furthermore, additional capital funding amounting to £80 million is to be made available over the next three years to speed up the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support these services.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists and waiting times are, of course, an international problem and we are not unique here in facing the challenge of reducing them. In-patient waiting lists represent 4% of the total discharges from acute hospitals. Having said this, the length of time that an individual patient must wait to gain access for a hospital procedure is of course a highly important indicator of how well the system is responding to demand and can be a more relevant measure than the actual number of patients on a waiting list.</P>

      <P>The problem of waiting lists in the acute hospital sector here is not new, although to listen to the Opposition one would think that we <Col N="784" /> had recently invented them. There is no getting away from the fact that during the lifetime of the last Government the impetus behind addressing waiting lists declined. The numbers on waiting lists and the length of waiting times for many specialties rose by fully one-third. What is truly remarkable in light of this evening's rhetoric is that a Government led by Deputy John Bruton, with Deputy Quinn in charge of the Department of Finance, actually cut the funding targeted at reducing waiting lists for public patients by a third in its last budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have set about redressing the results of this self-satisfied complacency in a comprehensive and structured manner. We have increased funding significantly under the waiting list initiative, providing £12 million in 1998, £20 million in 1999 and £23 million this year &ndash; a level almost three times that provided in the 1997 budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Crucially, however, we have also recognised that funding alone will not address the issue. Adequate funding for waiting lists is an important concern, but the underlying causes of waiting lists are considerably more complex. With this in mind, the Government commissioned an expert review group to examine these causes and to make recommendations on how to address them. The review group rightly pointed out that we must address the waiting list problem from a wide perspective, looking at those factors at the levels of primary care, secondary care and longer term care which can lead to unacceptably long lists. In particular, we must ensure that services at primary care level are properly structured to enable patients to be channelled to the most <Col N="785" /> appropriate point of service as efficiently as possible. At secondary care level, we must develop our hospital based services in a way that manages admissions and discharges effectively and deals speedily with the needs of those on waiting lists. At the level of longer-term care, we must provide sufficient step-down and rehabilitation facilities so that those no longer needing acute treatment can be best cared for outside the acute hospital setting. This, in turn, frees up acute hospital beds for elective procedures, including those for which there is a waiting list, and results in the optimum use of hospital beds to the greatest benefit of patients.</P>
      <P>The series of immediate, medium-term and longer-term objectives recommended by the review group form the basis of the Government's strategic approach to tackling the issue. A strong rate of progress is being made in implementing these recommendations. We are addressing the need to free up acute hospital beds by investing in sub-acute services. A range of measures for improved management arrangements and liaison with GPs are being put in place locally and the major funding available under the national development plan will help address the longer term capacity issues on the non-acute side.</P>
      <P>In summary, the Government has approached the whole issue of waiting lists in a far more structured and comprehensive manner than any previous Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There were very encouraging signs prior to the nurses dispute that this approach was paying dividends. Just before the strike began, in-patient waiting lists as on 30 September had fallen for the third successive quarter. They were down 9% compared with the beginning of the year and the integrated strategy the Government had adopted was showing real success. While the lists rose again in the immediate aftermath of the strike, the challenge now will be to regain lost ground while taking strong encouragement from the very positive impact the strategy has had in the first three quarters of 1999.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be seeking to build on that early progress with a view to achieving real improvements in the waiting times for access to services. This focus is being re-emphasised in my Department's discussions with agencies on their service plans for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All acute hospitals experience a seasonal increase in activity during the winter, particularly in December and January. This is not a uniquely <Col N="786" /> Irish phenomenon but is commonplace throughout Europe and most western health systems. The increase is largely attributable to elderly and other medical patients presenting with chronic illnesses, such as viral and bacterial infections and influenza, which can only be treated in hospital and which require a longer than normal hospital stay.</P>
    <P>The first priority of acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services is to provide care and treatment for emergency patients. Due to the nature of the service, attendances at accident and emergency departments are difficult to predict accurately in advance.</P>
    <P>Of over 1.2 million attendances in 1998, in excess of 540,000 of the total were to the accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services in the eastern region. Hospitals located in the eastern region experience greatest pressures, in terms of numbers presenting at accident and emergency departments and their abilities to respond to these pressures.</P>
    <P>If we are to manage our hospital services efficiently, it is important to ensure the most appropriate services are given in the most appropriate setting. We must ensure accident and emergency services are used only for emergencies. Inappropriate referrals to accident and emergency departments must be eliminated and self-referrals kept to a minimum. To do this, we need to have an adequate out of hours service by general practitioners. Regrettably, criticisms of the out of hours services being provided by GPs, not only in the Dublin area but throughout the country, are becoming more frequent. These criticisms relate to the unavailability of patients' GPs after normal working hours and to the slow response of GP deputising services. In addition, because of the perceived lack of knowledge by deputising GP services of patients' medical history, many patients are reluctant to avail of the deputising service. This has lead to a significant increase in the number of patients presenting in casualty departments when they should more appropriately be attending their GP.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as the DUBDOC GP out of hours project at St. James's Hospital, which works closely in conjunction with the accident and emergency department, and GP co-operatives in Carlow and in the North Eastern Health Board area will be evaluated carefully with a view to their development and extension throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the health boards, we are examining the adequacy and cost of GP out of hours service. I am determined that an adequate and cost effective service is provided by GPs, which will ensure a better quality service to patients, thereby eliminating inappropriate <Col N="787" /> attendances at accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks a significant increase in patient attendances at the accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals, particularly in the eastern region, was experienced, with an increase of approximately 25% in the number of patients requiring admission through the departments. The majority of these were aged 65 years and over and such was the nature of their illnesses that discharge after two to three days, as might be expected, was not possible. Their average length of stay was seven to ten days. This impacted hugely on each hospital's capacity to provide acute beds for the numbers attending each day who were deemed to require admission. At its peak, a total of 108 patients were awaiting admission in accident and emergency departments in the eastern region on 11 January 2000.</P>
      <P>Each hospital providing accident and emergency services adjusts clinically to manage the situation, with many extra efforts to improve the flow of patients through the system. In circumstances where a hospital is operating at full capacity, it may be necessary to cancel elective admissions to free up beds for emergency admissions, thereby inconveniencing patients and perpetuating waiting lists. This has a particular impact on the length of time people are required to wait for elective procedures.</P>
      <P>Hospitals efforts to cope with the increased demand for acute beds were also frustrated by bed closures brought about by a shortage of nursing staff. Nursing staff shortages are a feature of acute hospital provision generally, particularly in the eastern region. This factor, combined with high levels of sick leave due to the viral-bacterial illness presented, contributed to the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided additional funding to acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services to enable them to implement a range of initiatives in the medium term aimed at addressing the difficulties being experienced in their accident and emergency departments. These initiatives include the provision of step-down facilities, the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, the continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion. An additional £2 million is being provided in the current year to enable hospitals to continue with these initiatives.</P>
      <P>The increase in demand which has been experienced in accident and emergency departments in recent weeks has resulted in problems for many people presenting for care and treatment. I very much regret any distress or inconvenience to patients which has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House, however, that in order to provide more effectively for an anticipated increase over the 1999-2000 winter period in attendances of persons with flu or flu-like symp<Col N="788" /> toms at accident and emergency departments and to enable hospitals to respond to a surge in demand for acute hospital beds, the accident and emergency steering group for the eastern region was asked in March 1999 to suggest proposals which would effectively eliminate the &ldquo;trolley crisis&rdquo; in their accident and emergency departments during this period.</P>
    <P>The steering group identified those patients admitted to hospital who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who require a level of care more appropriate to their needs as the single biggest contributing factor to the problem. The Eastern Health Board subsequently submitted a proposal which envisaged the provision of 235 step-down places. Funding has been made available to provide these facilities. It is important to note that had these additional step-down beds not been in place, the impact of the increased demand for services would have been significantly greater. It has been acknowledged by the hospitals providing accident and emergency services that a major crisis was averted because of this additional bed capacity. This enabled, and continues to enable, hospitals to cope with the situation, albeit not without some inconvenience to patients in terms of waiting times for admission. This, together with the dedication and commitment of hospital management and staff, ensured that a major crisis was averted.</P>
    <P>Given the period of the millennium when the problem first occurred, the base nursing shortage at major hospitals, some complaints regarding a lack of adequate general practitioner services during the holiday period and the lack of notice and shortage of confirmation as to whether they were dealing with a flu epidemic, the accident and emergency departments should be congratulated on their performance.</P>
    <P>Hospitals providing accident and emergency services have been seeking to manage seasonal surges by improved admission and discharges management, rostering of additional staff where feasible and through the provision of additional long-term care, sub-acute and convalescent beds. Our initiatives have had an impact, but we recognise that much remains to be done. One of my priorities will be to address the persistent problem of seasonal pressures on our accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Health care systems in the European Union contain a mixture of the various basic financing methods, for example, general taxation, social insurance contributions, out-of-pocket co-payments and private insurance, with a different mix in every country. No one method is accepted as the ideal. Tradition and the social development of each nation seem to be the major determinants of the system to be found in each state, with evolution rather than revolution being the accepted process for the reform of health care financing, particularly in relation to the source of general finance for health. The OECD has praised the Irish health care system in both its last economic <Col N="789" /> reports on Ireland in 1997 and last year. The 1997 report concluded that the Irish health system, with its mixture of public and private care, had &ldquo;resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the taxpayer&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has asked the House to support the introduction of a system which it has not costed and has not set out in detail. It is a classic example of an Opposition presenting something as a quick and easy fix. This is another policy which featured nowhere near the Labour Party's agenda when it controlled either of the Departments of Health or Finance. An insurance based health system is not a panacea, it would involve major dislocation, have an uncertain outcome and potentially be extremely costly. If this is to form the centrepiece of a replacement for the previously spartan Labour Party policy on health, it can be assured that we will not let it away with glibly presenting it as the answer to everything.</P>
      <P>To give a simple example, Germany, with one of the largest social insurance based systems, is instituting major cost containment measures, including the introduction of global hospital budget limits and controversial drug prescribing limits. Hospitals in eastern Germany were only allowed a 1% increase in funding last year and major efforts are being made to reduce both the numbers of hospitals and hospital beds. Also, social insurance systems are usually heavily regulated and, frequently, unforeseen difficulties arise from contradictory effects of these regulations. An example is the increased use of hospital pharmacies following the introduction of prescribing limits for care in Germany. This means that the costs have simply shifted to a different part of the system.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party might like to note that across Europe many sickness funds are running deficits which governments have had to support from general taxation. In Belgium, for example, the scale of government intervention has reached a point where as much as 45% of the funding for sickness funds comes from general tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concentration throughout the developed world is on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery systems and on endeavouring to ensure that the systems' overall capacity better matches demand. There are no easy solutions to universal problems of financing health care. The way to radically improve the health of our society is to put a high level of resources into the services in a focused manner and manage those resources effectively. This Government is determined to commit the necessary resources and to get the needed results. The way forward will not be found through dressing up underdeveloped, uncosted proposals as the painless answer to everything. I suggest to the House that the major administrative costs which <Col N="790" /> would be involved would be better applied to the improvement of the public health care system.</P>
    <P>The developments I have described represent an enormous financial investment in our health care system. I intend to maintain the momentum for investment in health &ndash; and that is how it is rightly being seen &ndash; but I want to do more. I want the way the patients see the service to determine to a much greater extent how the care is delivered. This will mean devising new approaches to involve patients in the organisation and delivery of services. It will mean health providers making available much more and better information about what they do and how well they do it. It will mean, for example, putting in place formal patient advocacy structures on a much wider basis than currently exists. I want to proceed straight away with practical and imaginative projects in this area and will be looking to every care provider to make proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Later this week I will be launching a major initiative in the development of an accreditation programme for acute hospitals. This programme is based on the concept of whole hospital evaluation and is in line with similar quality improvement mechanisms in a number of the most advanced health care systems in the world. I see an initiative such as this as being a powerful driver for a whole range of quality measures, from the way a hospital is governed at board level through its approach to clinical care and right down to its patient responsiveness. In time this programme is expected to expand beyond the acute sector across the system as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to developing a modern and responsive health service which has the resources and structures it needs to provide care quickly when the need is identified. Patients have a right to care using treatments based on best practice. They have a right to well co-ordinated hospital services that will quickly identify and provide their treatment needs and integrate with other parts of the system. At all times this must be underpinned by basic considerations of dignity for patients with courtesy to them and their families.</P>
    <P>This is the objective facing everybody involved in the health system and the achievement of this objective requires a balanced debate about complex problems. Over less than three years, the Government has provided unprecedented resources to the health system and this has meant that more patients than ever are receiving the care they need. The largest programme of renewal and development in the history of Irish health care is well under way and is being felt throughout the system. In addition, a range of long-standing problems are being addressed through the implementation of considered and ambitious initiatives.</P>
    <P>Unlike the complacent record of those we replaced and who are now attacking us, we know more needs to be done and we are committed to doing what has to be done. I am honoured to <Col N="791" /> have been given the opportunity to work with the dedicated officials who make up the staff of my Department. I look forward to working with them and the thousands of health care professionals throughout the system in the coming years. I know that, working together and reinforced by the Government's ongoing commitment to the health service, we can go some way to ensuring that we are delivering the level and quality of service which our people deserve.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Health and Children. I have no doubt he will do as good a job in health as he did in education. I also take the opportunity to congratulate Deputy Hanafin on her appointment as Minister of State at that Department. The debate developing tonight is interesting. The Labour Party has raised some important issues relating to how we manage and deliver a health service to the public. Its contribution, however, has been marked, as so often in the past, by a lack of policy, basic costings and an absence of vision. The absence of that policy in tabling this motion was clearly to try to catch our new Minister for Health and Children on the hop in his first full week in that office. How badly mistaken it has been.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Labour Party could for the purposes of this debate leave aside its usual rhetoric and outline to us its fundamental problems with the provision of an unprecedented level of resources for our health service and proper planning for the development of these resources for the improved delivery of services. This year the level of development funding provided for the acute hospital system stands at five times what was provided when the Labour Party was in Government in 1997 and had control of the national purse strings through Deputy Quinn. In that year, £100 million of capital funding was provided for health infrastructure. This year £230 million will be available under the national development plan. Capital investment in the health services will be treble what it was in the previous six year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restructuring of the services in the eastern region will be actioned by the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in March. This will effect a meaningful improvement in the integrated management of the various components of the system in this region. A series of strategic plans and initiatives backed by real resources are in place to tackle major killers such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, to improve renal services, to achieve a quality driven hospital service accredited to highest international standards, to improve our emergency response services, to tackle the underlying causes of lengthy waiting lists, to enhance subacute and step-down service availability, to address issues relating to medical manpower, to improve management structures and involve clinicians in the decision making process. These are some of the major <Col N="792" /> activities in which this Government is meaningfully engaged in the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>Where sits Labour Party policy on any of these issues? I have not heard it and there were no signs of it when it was presiding over the allocation of meagre development funding when in Government. The Government of which it was part introduced important legislation to provide for greater accountability and structured service planning in the health sector. The legislation was widely recognised as necessary against a background of spiralling debts being run up by agencies and it was supported by us in Opposition on that basis. This Government has been successfully applying this accountability legislation. In Opposition, however, the Labour Party suddenly discovered it did not like its legislation when it was applied last year.</P>
    <P>The burden of rhetorical opposition rests very easily on its shoulders. What a shame for hospital users that responsibility in Government did not bring quite the same confident knowingness. Indeed, as the Minister pointed out, the Labour Party and its Government partners presided over a period of spiralling hospital waiting lists, prompted by their remarkable decision in 1997 to cut waiting list initiative funding by £4 million. That decision would have denied access to a hospital procedure to about 4,000 patients in that year. As the Minister outlined, the number of patients benefiting from hospital services under this Government continues to grow each year. For the benefit of the uninitiated that represents an expansion of service not a deterioration.</P>
    <P>That service is being delivered in hospitals which are better equipped now than under the previous Government. The previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, introduced a dedicated replacement equipment programme for hospitals which meant that for the first time they can budget for the upgrading of equipment. As the new Minister stated earlier, the challenge lies in continuing to introduce improvements so that the service available is as good as it can be.</P>

      <P>One's health is one wealth. We have a healthy and vibrant economy but our <Col N="793" /> health services are in a shambles. Each day the situation deteriorates. It is not fair that people in need of medical procedures, including cardiac surgery, orthopaedic surgery, gynaecological surgery, ophthalmological surgery and ENT surgery, but who cannot afford to pay for them must wait months, even years, to alleviate their suffering.</P>
      <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area, 51% of patients on the orthopaedic surgery list have been on it for over 12 months. Whey must people who are suffering pain and rendered immobile in many cases wait for relief for up to two years? It is not fair and it is negligent, at a time when, unlike heretofore, there are more than adequate resources available, to allow this situation to continue. It is difficult to understand the Government's rationale for doing this.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, 55% of those on the waiting list for ear, nose and throat surgery have been waiting for more than 12 months and 67% of children have been waiting for more than six months. Our national ethos is to treat all the children of the State equally. However, the Government has failed to do so. For those whose parents can afford treatment, the procedures will be carried out. For those who cannot afford it, their children must wait. I have heard of many cases where GPs are encouraging people who do not have the wherewithal to pay for an operation or treatment to place themselves in debt, thereby inflicting unnecessary stress during a most difficult and stressful time in their lives. This matter was already referred to by our colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Our health service must be patient-centred and must put patients first. Inadequacies in public hospital services are depriving those who need it of access within a reasonable timeframe to the medical services to which they are entitled. Those in the front line of health care provision, doctors and nurses, are required to work under unacceptable and intolerable pressure. A democratic state that guarantees you right of access to a lawyer if you commit a crime should guarantee you the right to a physician, essential in-patient hospital treatment or surgery if you become ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from figures released by the Department of Health and Children that the number of patients awaiting admission to hospital for elective surgery is growing steadily. The Minister outlined a comparison between the previous Government and the current Administration. However, I will now remind him of the figures supplied by his predecessor last June. At the end of June 1999, the in-patient waiting list for public patients stood at 33,924 countrywide, an increase of 3,471 or 11% in the first two years of the Government's term of office. According to the previous Minister for Health and Children, following the first ever national nurses' strike, the waiting list figures at the end of October stood at 37,200, an increase of over 3,500 in three months. It is estimated that during that damaging and preventable strike, 3,300 people had their surgery or procedures cancelled. It is unsatisfactory that we <Col N="794" /> will be obliged to wait until March to discover the waiting list figures for December. However, I suggest that these and the figures for January will tell a similar, damning tale in the wake of the large number of emergency admissions which resulted from the flu epidemic.</P>
    <P>Many of those already on waiting lists are obliged to wait from between 12 months to two years for the treatment to which they are entitled. Some must wait even longer. At a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, it is unacceptable that so many public patients must wait so long to be admitted to hospital. It is indefensible that life enhancing, pain relieving operations such as hip replacements should be out of reach for months and, in some cases, years for elderly and infirm people. It is unacceptable and unjust that children should have their school attendance disrupted by ongoing bouts of debilitating infection while the waiting list for ENT surgery grows longer each month. It is unacceptable that the education of school-going children with hearing difficulties is being seriously impaired. I know the Minister, from his experience at the Department of Education and Science, will agree with that statement. It is shocking that cardiac patients are dying while on the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>
    <P>Despite successive attempts to reduce waiting lists through so-called waiting list initiatives, it is clear that simply ploughing money into short-term reductions in numbers is not working. Each winter the waiting lists grow longer and each summer there are unjustified bed closures. This see-saw effect exacerbates rather than relieves the problem it is designed to overcome. As a result of hospital bed closures during the summer months and further autumn cutbacks which hospitals throughout the State were obliged to implement to attempt to remain within their financial budgets, it is estimated that the number currently on the hospital in-patient waiting list can be properly estimated at over 38,000. This means that waiting lists have increased by 24% during the Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>There are, in effect, two waiting lists for public patients. The 33,924 people who made up the waiting lists on 30 June 1999 were awaiting in-patient treatment for surgery. They have seen a consultant and have been examined and assessed as requiring hospital treatment. There are many thousands of people, adults and children, on another waiting list, namely, those awaiting initial appointments with a consultant. Remarkably the Department of Health and Children does not collate national statistics of those awaiting consultations, who are numbered in their tens of thousands. The 33,924 people to whom I referred represent only the tip of the waiting list iceberg.</P>
    <P>Doctors in one Dublin city general hospital were shocked but not surprised that their patients were obliged to wait five months for an initial appointment with a consultant dermatologist, eight months for an appointment with an ophthalmologist and six months for an appointment with a gynaecologist. Several of their patients, for <Col N="795" /> whom letters of referral were sent in August 1999, received appointments in June 2000. This situation is unacceptable. The problem is not unique to Dublin. There are more than 1,000 people awaiting neurological consultations in the Southern Health Board area, some of whom will be obliged to wait over 18 months for initial points with one of the three neurologists in that area which includes the second largest centre of population in the country, Cork city.</P>
    <P>Such delays create unnecessary anxiety for people whose medical condition may already be a cause of concern. Such delays can place patients lives at risk. While acknowledging that money invested in the waiting list initiative has solved individual health problems for many thousands of people, such special financial allocations have not structurally resolved the waiting list problem. A great deal more action is needed.</P>
    <P>To tackle the waiting list crisis a broad range of reforms is required which will impact on departmental, health board and Comhairle na n-Ospidéal procedures, hospital structures, the management of waiting lists and the manner in which general practitioners, consultants and medical staff work. The co-ordinated nationwide usage of the latest interactive communications as a diagnostic tool and for the administration and monitoring of the health services is also crucial in order to ensure a caring health service responsive to community needs which is equipped to meet the challenge of the new millennium. At a time of unprecedented economic growth, funds should be provided to put in place a comprehensive programme of measures which, once and for all, address the waiting list problem.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that piecemeal initiatives merely act as a palliative and a cure is needed. Fine Gael has proposed specific measures designed to tackle in-patient and out-patient waiting lists in a systematic and practical way to make acute hospital services more patient-centred.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists in the Mid-Western Health Board flagship hospital, the Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, Limerick, are totally unacceptable. Between June 1997, when Deputy Noonan left office, and June 1999, two years after this Government took office, there was a 36% increase in waiting list figures &ndash; an additional 415 patients.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west, 142 adults are awaiting ear, nose and throat surgery, 55% of whom are waiting for over 12 months; there are 84 children on the waiting list, 67% of whom have been waiting for over six months; 424 women are awaiting gynaecological procedures, almost 30% of whom are waiting over 12 months; 613 patients are awaiting ophthalmology treatment, 78% of whom are waiting over 12 months, of which 522 require cataract surgery. It is unfair that elderly people cannot read newspapers or books or see television at a time when they could enjoy such pleasures after decades of contributing to bring <Col N="796" /> the State to its current position. The Government has forgotten these people.</P>
    <P>Also in the mid-west, 331 people are awaiting orthopaedic surgery, 51% of whom are waiting over 12 months. This condition affects the elderly in particular and it is scandalous that people have to suffer while waiting for hip or other replacement operations. Why should people suffer in this way because they do not have the personal resources to pay for treatment?</P>
    <P>Orthodontic services in the Mid-Western Health Board region are a shambles and public representatives are regularly contacted about this. The Minister should examine this situation in particular as there is a problem. He would be well advised to ask his officials to speak to the consultant orthodontist and his staff who are extremely concerned about the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned improvements to mental health services under the new plan. This area has been neglected for too long. Our psychiatric services have a Third World status for many reasons and languish in the 1930s and 1940s when psychiatric hospitals were known as &ldquo;lunatic asylums&rdquo;. This is not a personal attack on the Minister as he has just taken office, but it is an attack on the performance of the Government. The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ended 31 December 1998, published last November, was most revealing. It highlighted the fact that a serious and disturbing situation has developed, with which I agree, and also referred to many serious deficiencies in the service. This is an indictment of the Government's treatment of one of the most vulnerable groups in society &ndash; the mentally ill. These patients have been neglected, ignored and stigmatised for decades.</P>
    <P>A total of 5,101 patients have been treated in psychiatric units and acute hospitals over the past decades. The Joint Committee on Health and Children hopes to discuss this issue on Thursday and, hopefully, it will take these matters on board. I hope to raise this issue with the Minister in addition to the associated issues of suicide and attempted suicide.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin on his appointment as Minister for Health and Children and Deputy Hanafin on her appointment as Minister of State and I wish them well. I note from press coverage that the Taoiseach's reasons for transferring the Minister have been cited as bolstering the Government's re-election prospects. There is no other reason the Taoiseach would have transferred a Minister who was successful in the Department of Education and Science and given him the poisoned chalice of the Department of Health and Children were it not for the fact that he felt he was the best man for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members, including the Minister, have been inundated with complaints from constituents about the inadequacy of the health services. Last Thursday I dealt with the case of a woman in Mallow hospital suffering from multiple organ <Col N="797" /> failure who was looking for a bed in Cork University Hospital. However, she could not get a bed or an ambulance to transfer her. I spoke to the admissions office in the hospital but was informed that there were no nurses or beds available. Yesterday in my constituency office I spoke to the husband of a woman admitted in an emergency to the Erinville hospital on Saturday night for a gynaecological operation. However, the position was the same &ndash; there was no bed available for surgery as of this evening and none is expected to be available until the weekend at least. Such cases are the tip of the iceberg and there are enormous problems.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to the motion welcomes the substantial increases in capital and revenue. We cannot argue with facts and there are increases in these areas. However, the amendment goes on to endorse the Government's ongoing strategy to deal with waiting lists. No one could endorse a situation in which waiting lists have grown over the past three years. I was disappointed by the Minister's explanation is so far as he appeared to blame nurses and doctors. That is not a good start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister reads his speech he will see that he said nurses were to blame for the growing waiting lists and doctors were to blame for problems in accident and emergency departments. That is a pretty poor starting point. The Department of Health and Children is a poisoned chalice and every Minister, in good times or bad, has found it difficult to please everyone. I hope the Minister will have some success in dealing with the major problems.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the parochial issue of cardiac surgery facilities in Cork University Hospital where there is one cardiac surgeon who is about to retire. I have spoken to him previously about individual constituents but this is an appalling situation which needs to be addressed as quickly as possible. A second issue is the location of BTSB facilities in Cork. As Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin listened sympathetically to calls for such a service but he was able to throw his hands in the air and say that he would solve the problem if this matter came within his portfolio.</P>

      <P>This issue is now part of his portfolio and people in Cork are waiting in anticipation. I will return to this issue in the future as I do not want to ruin the Deputy's inaugural appearance in the House as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to orthodontic services where guidelines are too restrictive and the cost of private treatment is beyond the means of many parents. This treatment involves far more than a <Col N="798" /> cosmetic procedure. It has implications for personal development, self confidence and so on and we need to investigate why, for example, treatment is so much cheaper in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the care of the elderly. All Members receive representations from people who want the State to take responsibility for their parents and who do not want to take any responsibility themselves. We should encourage continuing care in the community as far as is possible. However, when people have to be institutionalised, particularly in private nursing homes, we must examine the level of the nursing home subvention. The maximum is £120, although it might be increased in some cases, but this is totally inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Richard Bruton. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue which is of considerable importance to the people of my constituency and other constituencies in the greater Dublin area, particularly those bordering the bay. For many generations Dublin Bay has been an amenity and resource. There is always a balance to be struck when dealing with a facility of economic importance to the city which is also a significant amenity to those who live in the city and in the eastern region generally.</P>
      <P>This application was made by Dublin Port Company in autumn in a way and at a time which ensured it came to the attention of most people who would be directly affected by it, particularly those living in Clontarf, at a late stage in the day. There were few opportunities to make objections within the statutory period for which there is provision and I regret that. It has led to much bad feeling in my constituency about the issue.</P>
      <P>Since then, what has happened demonstrates the total inadequacy of the way in which we deal with applications of this kind generally. The law governing this has existed since the 1930s with some European regulations grafted on some time later. That law allowed the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to make a decision largely without a statutory requirement for public consultation. That such consultation takes place has come about through custom and practice and the European regulations which have been grafted on. That is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of adequacy in the law was clearly demonstrated by the response of the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, when he got himself into a knot over the issue of planning permission. He suggested to the port company that he would not be minded to grant the foreshore licence <Col N="799" /> unless an application was at least made, if not determined, for planning permission. Then he tried to say that, nonetheless, the two applications were in parallel and one would be decided without prejudice to the other. The Minister was trying to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that there is a potential conflict of interest anyway. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has an interest in the port as an economic unit which serves both the city and business in the eastern region. He is also obliged under current legislation to make a decision on environmental grounds. Apart from the legal competence of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to make a decision on environmental grounds, there is clearly a conflict of interests in so far as the Minister is wearing two hats.</P>
    <P>There should be clarity about the process. Has the Minister had legal advice on his decision about planning permission? What is the Minister's view on the merits of the application?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The old Joni Mitchell song said, &ldquo;Don't it always seem to be that we don't know what we got 'til it's gone&rdquo;. That is the case in Dublin Bay. A commercial company is seeking permission to produce free land from its point of view. That is what drives this. The Minister's decision to go through a planning process is welcome on one level, it has some public dimension, but it treats the issue as if it were a technicality to be determined solely by An Bord Pleanála. This is a regional issue about alternative uses of the bay and the long-term social costs and benefits. That will not enter the framework when An Bord Pleanála makes its decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell pointed out that there are serious legal doubts about the legality of the Minister's actions because he admits that he is only now looking for legal endorsement from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for this method of handling future foreshore applications. The examples cited by the Minister are not similar to this one.</P>
      <P>There is a clear conflict of interest between being a shareholder in the port and determining this. At the heart of the matter, we must ask if we will use the bay, a public amenity for the people of Dublin, solely to meet the commercial needs of Dublin port for free land. This should not be seen as solely an issue for An Bord Pleanála, it is a wider political issue and the Minister must look at that dimension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Port Company applied to the previous Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for permission under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, as amended, to have 21 hectares of foreshore owned by the company in the port area reclaimed for port purposes. Publication of an EIS in respect of the project and the <Col N="800" /> commencement of a process of public consultation were advertised prominently in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 October and copies of the EIS and other associated documents necessary for the public consultation process were made available for the statutory period of one month at both the port company's offices and Store Street Garda station. The purpose of such public consultation is to afford the public an opportunity to make submissions in relation to the proposed development.</P>
      <P>The port company has advised that, following publication of a notice in the newspapers on 1 October and having regard to the relatively small attendance at the exhibition in the port offices of the public consultation documents, public representatives for the area, at both national and local level, known residents associations in the area and other known interested parties such as An Taisce and Birdwatch Ireland were written to and invited to attend at the company's offices. The company advises that the response was mixed, with some attending and having fruitful discussions, some sending apologies and some ignoring the invitation.</P>
      <P>A total of 428 submissions were made to me on the proposed reclamation. The vast bulk of these were from individual residents or family groups with Clontarf addresses, while two were from community action groups, the Clontarf Residents Association and the East Wall Community Development Council. The submissions were under 14 broad headings.</P>
      <P>The observations made on the proposal, 16 of which were in favour, have been referred to the port company for its response, which is now to hand. My Department has engaged independent consultants to review the adequacy of the EIS prepared by Dublin Port Company. If adequate, the submissions made and the company's responses to them, together with the company's proposal for the reclamation, will be considered by them and a report made to my Department. The Department will then assess those reviews and responses and will make recommendations to the Minister. This process will take at least two months to complete.</P>
      <P>If the EIS is found to be inadequate, the company will be required to publish a supplementary EIS or, if the shortcomings are deemed to be serious enough, publish a new EIS. In that event, the time scale for a decision could be significantly longer than the two months just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best standards of public planning require that a proposal on the scale envisaged by the port company are dealt with on an integrated basis. On environmental grounds alone there is little point in my granting permission for reclamation if the company does not receive planning permission for the development it proposes on the area of foreshore in question. My Department has, therefore, advised the company that, without prejudice to any decision which the Minister will ultimately take on the application for permission under the Foreshore Acts, in the event of a posi<Col N="801" /> tive decision the Minister will require the board, before any reclamation commences, to apply for and obtain full local authority planning permission for the proposed reclamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>This approach is in line with my Department's actions in developments in State owned harbours where the foreshore is owned by the State. It will be recalled that my Department went through the planning permission process in respect of the reclamation of foreshore for the construction of the ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire. My Department will be applying for planning permission for proposed developments at Killybegs and Castletownbere harbours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and understand the politics of leaking information which has been part and parcel of this Government since its inception. However, the latest leak by the Department of Defence which has sole responsibility for the White Paper goes beyond what is acceptable.</P>
      <P>When Opposition parties seek information from a Department it is common courtesy to ensure such information is made available. I asked for the date of the publication of the White Paper on defence the last time the Minister for Defence answered questions in the House. I was told it would be available later in the year. The same answer was given by the Taoiseach to Deputy John Bruton in the past few weeks. I found it insulting, degrading and I considered it bad manners by the Minister and his Department when I read in a recent edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that a reporter had been given two copies of the proposals. Opposition spokespersons could only get a reply of &ldquo;later in the year&rdquo;. Neither did the representative bodies receive copies &ndash; the Minister and his Department appear to feel that such an action would not be worthwhile. Morale in the Defence Forces does not matter. The members of the Defence Forces are only soldiers, or perhaps they are merely numbers. The Department of Defence has behaved disgracefully. Leak after leak has occurred prompting one soldier to remark that there cannot be a plumber in the Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> Will the Minister supply the House with answers? Who gave the two copies of the White Paper to the <i>Irish Independent</i>? What action has been taken to prevent a recurrence of such an act? When will the Opposition spokespersons and the representative associations be afforded the same courtesy as a newspaper reporter? Will there be an internal investigation into the events leading to this leak?</P>
    <P>The Department has responsibility for the Defence Forces. This means that every aspect of the Defence Forces must be dealt with. On many occasions I have spoken about morale in the three sections which make up the forces. Morale has again been damaged by this latest episode. In the last few days the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps have seen unprecedented statements being made by the relevant sections of each sector. All sectors are complaining, although that term may be too mild to describe the feelings evoked by the Department's action. Members of the Defence Forces have families and commitments and feel they have a future in the Defence Forces. In many cases their plans have been put in jeopardy by the cold hand of an uncaring Department.</P>
    <P>What value would the Department gain from this action? Why can the Department not deal properly with the representative bodies and with Opposition spokespersons who have always been agreeable and forthcoming in assisting the Department with any changes the Minister requested. I am disappointed this has happened and I ask him to clear the air of depression that has descended on the Defence Forces in the last few weeks, to ensure that an investigation is held to clear up the mess created by ignoring standard procedures and to allow everyone concerned with the White Paper to examine it properly, either in discussions between his Department and the representative bodies, RACO and PDFORRA in a formal setting, or with the Opposition spokespersons in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this important matter. I deplore the wholly unauthorised release of the draft of the White Paper on defence to a newspaper. It is a distasteful occurrence which can only have an adverse effects on the conduct of a complex and sensitive dialogue between the key stakeholders. If the intention of those who released this draft into the public arena was to put me under pressure, let me assure them that I am made of stronger stuff and I have no intention of being diverted or subverted from what I believe to be the correct way to proceed.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on defence is concerned with the Government's policy and approach to defence and the Minister and the Government must be free to make decisions in these areas without being pre-empted by those whose task it will be to implement those decisions and policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the military authorities have initiated an investigation into the circumstances in which confidential material relating to the <Col N="803" /> White Paper was supplied to a number of newspapers and I await the findings of this inquiry with interest.</P>
    <P>The White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years. The overall objectives of the White Paper as published at the commencement of the consultative process are as follows: to provide a medium term policy framework within which defence policy can evolve to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme of defence services, already commenced under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the management of defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative centrally, and to set out the basis for the future development of Civil Defence policy and the follow-up to the present Towards 2000 strategy.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong to construe these objectives as meaning something other than what they say, namely that the White Paper process offers a comprehensive and positive opportunity for the development of defence. Furthermore, as I have indicated many times, real positive changes continue to be made in the Defence Forces &ndash; new equipment, better infrastructure, closure of barracks, regular recruitment, improved overseas allowances and improved and more streamlined organisation structures.</P>
    <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the defence Vote for new equipment and in providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces. I intend to continue, and expand where possible, the modernisation programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their roles.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance I have placed on the consultation element of the process. I was aware that a topic of such fundamental importance as defence should be the subject of widespread consultation. I was also keenly conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation on the one hand and my duty as Minister in relation to the formation of defence policy on the other.</P>
    <P>In August 1998 a notice was inserted in the national press inviting interested individuals and organisations to make submissions to my Department. Over the following six months or so a total of 46 submissions were received from a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations and following examination of these, invitations were extended to a number of individuals or groups where it was felt that further contact would be useful. My concern was to ensure that all of those who wished to make an input to the White Paper process should be facilitated in doing so. In that regard, the key stakeholders, <Col N="804" /> including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs and the military authorities have had an opportunity to make their input to the White Paper. Throughout the drafting process the military authorities have also been able to make their input in a number of different ways. I cannot accept the claim that the Defence Forces were not given a sufficient input to the design of the White Paper, for this is tantamount to accusing me of not performing my job as Minister.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on defence will be completed very shortly and I intend to bring forward my proposals immediately for consideration and approval by Government. These proposals will address all aspects of the development of the Defence Forces including the overall defence policy framework, manpower, organisation, equipment and resourcing generally. As with all Government publications, the White Paper will be widely promulgated.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that consultations on the White Paper will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>

      <P>On many occasions in the House I have drawn attention to the fact that the uptake of our childhood immunisation programme is only approximately 75%, despite the fact that the Department of Health and Children has set a target uptake of 95%. This is the level needed to ensure that the population as a whole is protected for nominated infectious diseases. We need to develop a phenomenon known as the herd immunity effect, that is the level of immunity in the population above which an epidemic cannot start. Once that level is reached the unvaccinated will benefit from everyone else's immunisation. However, unless a disease is eradicated from a population the risk of an epidemic arises if the uptake rate of immunisation drops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am alarmed by comments made by the director of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, Dr. Darina O'Flanagan, who has said that she had no doubt that unless we get our take-up rate up to the 95% within the next few years we can expect a major increase in the number of cases of measles. Many people think measles is a minor illness and in many cases it is, but in some children it can cause severe brain damage and one in 10,000 children who get measles will die from the disease. The figures from the Department of Health and Children for the take up in the various health board regions are: Midland Health Board, 68%; Mid-Western Health Board, 73%; Southern Health Board, 75%; Eastern Health Board, 76%; North-Eastern Health Board, 77%; and South-Eastern Health Board, 78%. These figures show that nationally one in four children of two years has not received the immunisation programme as desired by the Department of Health and Children. It shows that the policy has <Col N="805" /> failed, that it is not a success and that it needs to be re-examined and revised if we are to avoid an epidemic.</P>
    <P>The aim of the national childhood immunisation programme is to eliminate vaccine preventable diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib disease, measles, mumps and rubella, by achieving the desired 95% uptake in the childhood population. Recent reports from the Eastern Health Board show an increase in the number of cases of measles for the month of January. Is this the tell-tale sign following a lower than desired uptake of the national immunisation programme?</P>
    <P>A review group was established in 1993 to examine the low uptake problem. One of the recommendations of the group was that the GP was ideally placed to administer the immunisation scheme and should be the principal health professional involved in delivery. However, we are all aware of the difficulties which have arisen concerning implementation of the scheme. There was a dispute with the public health nurses who refused to implement the scheme for reasons which have now been resolved. They were not consulted on the development of the scheme. What has been done to follow up the position of those children who were not immunised at the time of the dispute? Apart from the low uptake, there was obviously a gap in the system at the time. I would like to be reassured that those children not contacted by public health nurses at the time have been followed up and have been immunised if the parents so wish.</P>
    <P>I have asked questions on this matter on a number of occasions and have always been told that the health boards have put in place arrangements to evaluate and monitor the programme with a view to developing strategies to maximise the uptake. What monitoring of heath boards does the Department of Health and Children conduct to ensure that the maximum uptake is achieved? The Minister replies to my questions by saying it is a matter for the health boards, but if we have an epidemic, it will be a matter for the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is important to treat the parents of young children with respect and to provide them with balanced information on the side effects or the adverse reactions. The advice from GPs to whom I have spoken has always been that it is safer to have children immunised and that there is evidence to that effect. However, I accept that, given information, people can make decisions for themselves. I am concerned that parents of young children are not contacted. A programme does not seem to be in place to contact all parents of young children to ensure that the children enter the immunisation programme.</P>
    <P>Recently &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; covered the flu vaccine and highlighted the low uptake in the Dublin area. Only 23% of those eligible for the flu vaccine took it up. The fact that a GP had not contacted them was one of the main reasons given. Anyone who took the vaccine did so because <Col N="806" /> their GP had contacted them or had explained the situation to them and they felt confident in taking the vaccine. It was not because they got a leaflet through the door or because they read newspaper articles or saw advertisements on television but because their GP contacted them.</P>
    <P>What facilities are being put in place to bridge the gap between the national figure of 75% and the required figure of 95% to avoid an epidemic, which is looming, if we are to believe the director of the national surveillance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for raising this important issue and I am glad to have the opportunity to set the position straight. The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children under the age of two against a number of serious infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib disease, measles, mumps and rubella. The current arrangements were introduced in December 1995 and involve general practitioners entering into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of a programme. Parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the doctor of their choice.</P>
      <P>The target uptake for this programme is 95% at two years of age. If this uptake is achieved in the population, the level of immunity in the population as a whole is such that diseases cannot spread and, if a sufficiently high uptake is maintained, they should eventually be eradicated. It is recognised, however, that we have not reached these targets. The average reported uptake for DTP, Hib and polio immunisation is approximately 85%, and for MMR it is approximately 77%. However, a recent study carried out on behalf of the directors of public health in the North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board areas showed that actual uptake was considerably higher than the reported figures.</P>
      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards. A total of £1.25 million in additional funding for the programme has been provided in this year's allocation to health boards and they have been requested to pay particular attention to securing improvements in this regard. They are being urged to explore all possible avenues and, if necessary, adopt novel approaches in their efforts to secure improvements. Doctors, public health nurses and health board administrators have a role to play in spreading the immunisation message. I urge all those involved to continue to make all possible efforts to promote the immunisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns are periodically expressed about the safety of vaccines which may lead some parents to decide against having their children immunised. The Department's policy on childhood immunisation is guided by advice from the national immunisation committee of the Royal <Col N="807" /> College of Physicians of Ireland and in accordance with international best practice as enunciated by the World Health Organisation. To date, scientific scrutiny has not revealed a causal link between immunisation and a range of diseases and disabilities which it has been suggested are linked to receipt of vaccines in childhood. The international consensus is that the benefits of immunisation greatly outweigh possible risks, that the incidence of a range of vaccine preventable diseases has been greatly reduced with lower morbidity and mortality and that this development is directly related to the introduction and implementation of effective vaccination programmes. The experience in Ireland is in line with the international situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The current low immunisation uptake in Ireland, especially of the MMR vaccine, leaves us vulnerable to an epidemic and there are indications that the incidence of measles may be on the increase. My Department understands from the National Disease Surveillance Centre that it has contacted the directors of public health in the health boards to ask them to pay particular attention to the surveillance of measles. The information received in response indicates that there has been a sharp increase in the number of cases of measles notified to the Eastern Health Board since the beginning of 2000. Consequently, the director of public health for the Eastern Health Board has written to family doctors to emphasise the need to maximise MMR uptake.</P>
    <P>The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's publication, Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland, contains detailed information for doctors on immunisation, contra-indications to the administration of vaccines and their possible side effects. General practitioners request parents to give informed consent to their children's immunisation and this would include informing them about benefits, possible contra-indications and side effects which may occur. Observation by general practitioners of the advice given on the contra-indications to immunisation in individual cases will also help to minimise the incidence of adverse reactions.</P>
    <P>Many vaccines require a number of doses to achieve adequate immunity. It is, therefore, important that, where the immunisation schedule specifies that a number of doses of a vaccine are required, parents ensure that their children receive the full course of primary immunisation and also the appropriate booster dose as they become older. The benefits of immunisation greatly outweigh the risks of possible side effects, and I urge all parents to ensure their children are immunised to protect them against a range of potentially serious and preventable childhood diseases. My Department remains committed to the uptake targets and will continue to work with the health boards and other interests involved to ensure they are achieved.</P>
    <P>Regarding those children who may have missed out on their immunisation due to problems with <Col N="808" /> public health nurses, the health boards have asked both doctors and public health nurses to retrace some of those cases.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Flood Relief.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Christmas Eve, due to very heavy rain and exceptionally high tides &ndash; probably unprecedented &ndash; and, in the view of the local community, because of works on the River Shannon associated with the Limerick main drainage scheme, a flooding occurred in St. Mary's parish in Corbally, principally at Sir Harry's Mall and Athlunkard Street. Many houses were flooded with water coming in front and back doors, floor coverings were destroyed and ancillary damage was caused to the houses and their furnishings. The flooding was unprecedented in its severity and extent. Areas never flooded before were flooded. There were unprecedented high tides and there was extremely heavy rain. I do not know to what degree the work on the river aggravated the increase in flooding. The bunds placed on the river to allow construction to take place will, when removed, be replaced by a weir. If the bunds caused the flooding the weir will do so also. I would like the Minister to investigate that matter.</P>
      <P>I approached this matter by way of written question and received an unsatisfactory reply on 26 January. It was a reply with the level of objectivity which only somebody sitting in the Custom House, 120 miles from the flooding, could have had. The issues raised were not properly addressed. First, I want a commitment from the Minister that the cause of the flooding will be properly examined and established. Second, I want a commitment that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, together with the Office of Public Works, will prescribe the remedial works necessary for Limerick Corporation and that it will provide the corporation with the required funding to ensure this problem is remediated.</P>
      <P>According to the city engineer in correspondence with me, a combination of adverse weather conditions will create flooding in a number of different low lying areas in Limerick city without major investment in the provision of new improved quay walls, embankments and drainage systems. If these were put in place it would contribute in a very significant manner to resolving the problems. Limerick Corporation has been in correspondence with the Office of Public Works and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am not quite sure whose writ runs now in circumstances where flooding such as this occurs. I am not sure whether it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works in their wider remit for arterial drainage or the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the local authorities in their remit for remediating minor waterways and incidences of flooding in towns. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The third point I wish to raise relates to compensation. I raised this issue in my parliamentary question and it was dismissed in the reply in the most cursory fashion as if the idea of compensation for flood damage had never before been raised. There are several precedents. I recall when cottages in Ballsbridge were flooded and compensation was provided. When the river flooded Clonmel, compensation was provided. When Fermoy was flooded some compensation was provided. Compensation was provided after flooding in the rural areas of south-east Galway some years ago. It is not unknown for national schemes to have been introduced to compensate farmers for the loss of fodder in times of severe rain and flooding. There are precedents for compensation payments as a result of flooding.</P>
    <P>I do not think a request by people in Limerick whose homes were flooded for the same treatment as has been provided in the past to other communities should be dismissed out of hand in the manner in which it was dismissed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in his reply to me on 26 January. Many people who live in areas subject to flooding cannot get insurance cover against flood damage. They can get fire insurance and all sorts of other insurance but flood damage is not covered. I ask the Minister of State, whom I thank for coming here this evening, to have this situation examined again. Limerick Corporation has a full register of the homes damaged by the floods on Christmas Eve. I ask him to approach this matter in an open handed way and if the houses not covered by insurance can be identified by Limerick Corporation &ndash; and I am certain they can &ndash; that he provide compensation.</P>
    <P>Flooding took place over a limited area. We are not talking about millions of pounds, we are not even talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds. We are talking about adequate sums of money so that the superficial damage can be repaired. Many of the people involved are not wealthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I would like to express again the Government's sympathy to the people in the various areas affected by the flooding over the Christmas period. Unfortunately, no funds are available to this Department to compensate for damage or loss of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the reply to Question No. 561 of 26 January, the flooding in Limerick was mainly due to a combination of heavy rainfall and unprecedented high tides. Low atmospheric pressures also played a part. A high tide of 8.6 metres, influenced by westerly winds and heavy rainfall, was recorded at Limerick dock gauge on the evening of 24 December 1999. This was the high<Col N="810" /> est ever tide level recorded for the area. I understand the flooding was at its worst on Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day and that it persisted to a lesser extent into the new year.</P>
    <P>Limerick Corporation engineering staff, fire and sanitary services personnel and the Limerick main drainage contractor were on duty throughout. Such relief measures as were possible, including pumping operations, were carried out by Limerick Corporation. The Army and Civil Defence assisted in protecting property by sand-bagging. Temporary bunds, constructed in connection with the Limerick main drainage scheme, which at one point it was considered might be contributing to slowing the abatement of flood waters in the area adjacent to the Abbey River, were also breached by the contractor at the corporation's request in the hope that it might accelerate a reduction in the level of the floodwaters. It is important, however, to clarify that the bunds were not a contributory factor to the flooding. During the worst two days both bunds on the Abbey River were actually below water level, such was the depth of the flow.</P>
    <P>When completed, the Limerick drainage scheme, which is being funded by the Department of the Environment and Local Government with assistance from the EU Cohesion funds, will help remove foul sewage problems associated with flooding throughout the city and will eliminate the potential for surface water overflows at a number of locations. However, I understand that to deal specifically with the flooding issue, Limerick Corporation intends to initiate a detailed study to try to identify a long-term solution to the problem. The corporation has been in contact with the Office of Public Works and it is seeking in conjunction with Office of Public Works to have a report prepared that would allow proposals to be brought forward to reduce the risks of a recurrence. This would require extensive investigation by consultants, including a study of quay walls, road levels, river embankments, storage and monitoring the flow and tide levels in the Shannon. If any proposals should emanate from this study that would be eligible for funding under the Department's water services or roads programmes they will be sympathetically considered. In the meantime a number of short-term preventative measures are being taken, including pumping standby arrangements, discharge controls and facilities to partially remove bunding if necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Acts, the Office of Public Works is empowered to undertake drainage schemes in response to flooding from any watercourse for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing incidences of flooding. Other responsibilities in relation to certain navigable waters rest with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Waterways Ireland, the new cross-Border authority. While we will assist in any way we can, it is not a function of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to formulate a response to the problem of flooding. Grants from the <Col N="811" /> Environment and Local Government Vote to local authorities for public water supply and sewerage schemes address flood relief requirements only in the context of measures to relieve overloading of sewerage networks in built-up areas. On a more general level and with an eye to the future, to ensure that flooding risks may be taken into account in the development process, <Col N="812" /> the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will allow local authorities to make it an objective of development plans to regulate, restrict or control development in areas at risk of flooding, whether inland or coastal.</P>

      <P>My Department is about to engage in discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in regard to the employment by local authorities of archaeologists. The Department also raised the issue with the County Managers Association in December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal that local authorities would appoint their own archaeologists is one that I support. It would ensure greater devolution of responsibilities to local authorities whereby they would take a more direct interest in the protection of their own local archaeological heritage and in this way, provide more efficient and effective management of the archaeological resource. As the Deputy may already be aware, several local authorities have already appointed archaeologists to their staff, most notably Dublin and Cork corporations. These appointments have not only acted to provide advice and assistance to the local authorities and developers on proposals for new developments in a more hands-on way, but they have been very successful in heightening awareness of the existence of and the need to protect sites of archaeological interest. I encourage other local authorities to follow suit and I hope to be able to explore in the coming months <Col N="814" /> the possibilities for putting such arrangements in place on a more widespread basis.</P>

This is a very substantial investment in the waterways and will lead to a much enhanced product that will enable us to consolidate and expand the tourism market for waterways associated holidays and activities and help spread the tourism benefits to the many small rural communities along the waterways corridors.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, has been established under the British-Irish Agreement. Waterways Ireland has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout this island, principally for recreational purposes. Waterways Ireland took charge of the Shannon-Erne Waterway on 2 December last and, on 1 April next, will take over the rest of the south's waterways for which Dúchas now has responsibility, namely the Shannon navigation, the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow navigation. Waterways Ireland is responsible to the North-South Ministerial Council. I have already met with my Northern counterpart, Mr Michael McGimpsey, MLA, and I will be having further discussions with him through the North-South Ministerial Council regarding inland waterways and the programmes and actions to be pursued by Waterways Ireland.</P>
      <P>The money being provided in 2000 in relation to the development of the canal system is £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>The works to be undertaken include: design of bridges to replace existing culverts blocking navigation; reconstruction of bog embankments; design of additional water supplies; dredging and reconstruction of the canal channel and banks; installation of landings, jetties, moorings slipways and associated landscaping plus repairs to existing operational structures; and completion of barge restoration programme.</P>

      <P>Six sites have been offered to my Department for the proposed visitor centre for Mayo National Park, two of which are considered as suitable and we would hope to acquire one within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994-99 tranche of EU Structural Funds an amount of £2 million was allocated provisionally for the centre. It became clear in late summer 1997 that the EU deadline for completion of the project end 2000 was unlikely to be met so the funds were decommitted in October of that year and re-allocated to other Structural Funds projects. At that time I gave an assurance that the project would be submitted for assistance under the next round of EU Structural Funds and I am pleased that a sum of £3 million has been included in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the construction of the new centre.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for implementing the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and the EU Birds Directive 79/49/EEC and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both these directives are being implemented. However, the EU Commission initiated legal action against Ireland for failure to transmit a list of special areas of conservation as required under the EU Habitats Directive. I have since transmitted 236 sites to the Commission, but the list is still incomplete and the legal action is proceeding.</P>
      <P>In addition a reasoned opinion has been issued in respect of overgrazing, particularly in regard to the Owenduff-Nephin Beg site in the context of the birds Directive. Despite a full response outlining steps taken to deal with the matter, I have recently been informed that the Commission intends to pursue legal action.</P>
      <P>In addition, Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 097/36/EC, Television Without Frontiers, promotes the free flow of broadcasting services across national boundaries by means of cable and other transmission systems. A reasoned opinion dated 9 July 1999 was issued by the European Commission against Ireland for non-implementation of Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC.</P>

      <P>This directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, in February 1997. The first part of Ireland's <Col N="820" /> proposed SAC network was publicised in March 1997 by the then Minister, Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister, I concluded that adequate consultation procedures had not been introduced. I immediately directed that no site be formally transmitted to the EU Commission until after adequate consultation occurred.</P>
      <P>My Department has had numerous meetings with farming, conservation and other interests since the original sites were publicised and prior to the publicisation of additional sites in August-September 1999. In addition, I have established local liaison committees to discuss difficulties arising out of the proposals, where landowners are agreeable to their formation.</P>
      <P>I have also established an independent advisory board to make appropriate recommendations to me in respect of objections submitted by landowners regarding the proposed sites. This board is chaired by the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, and comprises representatives of landowners and conservation groups. I have indicated to the EU Commission that I will not formally transmit a site until all relevant objections have been fully examined and decided upon.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that I have implemented a full consultative programme in respect of these proposals best suited to ensuring successful implementation of the directive in this country.</P>

      <P>Determinations which I make under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, are confined to determining the intrinsic scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest of the building, and do not purport to determine the entitlement of owners-occupiers to claim tax relief under the Act.</P>
      <P>The position is that the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, for relief for expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 301 and 302 on 2 February 1999. Solutions to the interference problems mentioned in that reply have been identified and implemented. I understand from RTE that the RTE transmitters at Clermont Carn in County Louth have been operating on increased power for a number of months without causing difficulty. RTE estimate that reception of its television services has increased to at least 70% of the population of Northern Ireland from roughly 30% which was the level when the current efforts to secure clearance for the increased coverage began. I am hopeful that final political clearance can be obtained for the increased power at Clermont Carn in the near future.</P>
      <P>The suggestion by the Deputy regarding the establishment of RTE transmitters in Northern Ireland would have to be pursued at inter-governmental level and is not under consideration.</P>

      <Quest>the number of archaeological excavations which have been visited by archaeological staff from her Depart ment as a result of 800 licence applications and 5000 planning applications referred to her Department in 1999; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The majority of archaeological licences are issued on foot of conditions attached to planning permissions for development which prescribe an archaeological input so that the licensing and planning functions of the archaeological service of my Department are complementary.</P>
      <P>In 1999 a total of 72 site inspections were carried out by my archaeological service to ensure that proper archaeological standards were being applied by the profession and that planning permission conditions relating to archaeology as well as licensing conditions were adhered to.</P>
      <P>This number may seem somewhat on the low side but given the demands generally on my archaeological service resulting from the increase in construction activity impacting on sites of archaeological interest, I am satisfied that the attention given to site inspections represents the most efficient use of the resources available to me. Nevertheless, the inspections that are being carried out act as a good barometer for assessing the standards employed across the profession but I regret that the resultant evidence indicates that the archaeological work being carried out remains somewhat sub-standard.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure standards among the profession are raised so that the integrity of the archaeological heritage is preserved wherever possible. My Department is constantly looking at ways to raise these standards. Among the initiatives to date have been the publication by me of two policy documents last year, Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage and Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavations. These not only target the archaeological profession but also the developers who sponsor excavations and whom, in many cases can compromise the value of archaeological excavation work in an effort to press ahead with their developments.</P>
      <P>My Department also has established and maintains a register of professional archaeologists who are eligible to hold licences. In the past, licences have been withheld from archaeologists where they have failed to satisfy my Department in relation to fulfilling the terms and conditions of licences previously issued to them. Finally, my Department also carefully vets all applications to become a licence holder and it has established an advisory panel to interview independently all such applicants. In this way, the competence of newly-qualified archaeologists can be assessed before allowing them on site.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that these measures will help in raising the standard of excavations generally and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to strive to improve those standards.</P>

      <P>When Wicklow County Council initially proposed to widen the N11 through the Glen of the Downs, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department &ndash; then the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works &ndash; expressed its concerns about the impact of the scheme on the nature reserve. Their primary concerns related to the area of land required for the road, the number of trees to be felled and the impacts on the stream and wet woodland on the eastern side of the nature reserve. As a result the county council made several major adjustments to the road scheme, realigning it away from the stream and narrowing it by several metres.</P>
      <P>I am aware that submissions on hydrogeology were given in evidence by the objectors to the road scheme to the High Court during a judicial review action concerning the proposed road-widening scheme through the Glen of the Downs which was heard in 1999. Wicklow County Council assured the Court that their road design scheme would take account of all concerns raised. The High Court was satisfied that the issues relating to hydrology were properly addressed in the environmental impact assessment. A permeable layer will be included in the road construction to ensure that groundwater flow is not impeded by the road. The High Court and the Supreme Court have held that a valid environmental impact assessment has been carried out for the proposed road scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> My Department will continue to monitor the scheme during the construction phase and will liaise with Wicklow County Council to ensure construction impacts on the glen are minimised.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every effort has been made to mitigate the negative effects of the road scheme on the glen. In addition, substantial compensation measures, including the planting of 6,000 native oak seedlings and the addition of 0.85 hectares of land to the nature reserve in return for the 0.68 hectares removed, are being undertaken. 87 per cent of the improved road through the glen will be built over existing or former road surfaces.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is responsible for navigation only on the River Shannon and one of its principal duties is to ensure that there is adequate water depth for the navigation of boats on the system. This activity applies almost exclusively to the cruising season, from mid-March to October, as only a few hundred of the 75,000 boat passages through the locks annually occur during the winter months.</P>
      <P>Water levels in the three main lakes on the river, Loughs Allen, Ree and Derg, are controlled by the ESB. Water levels-depths in the river between these lakes are controlled by Dúchas for navigation purposes by means of a series of weirs with sluices. These weirs are so constructed as to retain water at a level adequate for navigation but they are overtopped in times of flood. When the water level rises in the river above that necessary for navigation purposes, the sluices are opened and any weir-boards removed so as to aid the flow of water. When the water is flowing freely over the tops of the weirs and all the sluices are open, Dúchas has no further control on water levels.</P>
      <P>None of the Acts which apply to navigation grants powers or imposes duties on me relating to drainage matters or flood relief. While I regret the damage and hardship caused to families by the recent flooding, I am not in a position to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to advise the Deputy that Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, has been established <Col N="830" /> under the British-Irish Agreement. Waterways Ireland has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout this island, principally for recreational purposes. Waterways Ireland took charge of the Shannon-Erne Waterway on 2 December last and, on 1 April next, will take over the rest of the South's waterways for which Dúchas now has responsibility, namely the Shannon navigation, the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow navigation. The British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, provides that my powers and functions in respect of these waterways are transferred to Waterways Ireland on the respective dates. Waterways Ireland is responsible to the North-South Ministerial Council in which I will participate with my colleague Minister McGimpsey of the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>

      <P>Representations from the Deputy on behalf of the millennium proposal for floodlighting and installing a millennium church bell referred to in his question were received by the Millennium Office on 10 May 1999 and were acknowledged the following day. Further representations by the Deputy to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on this proposal were referred to the Millennium Office and they were acknowledged on 18 May 1999.</P>
      <P>The millennium proposal concerned was submitted to the National Millennium Committee at the earliest opportunity. Following consideration of the matter, the committee made a recommendation to award up to £5,000 towards the cost of the floodlighting aspect of the proposal, subject to confirmation of details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the procedures agreed with the Government, the recommendations of the millennium committee are submitted for Government approval prior to formal confirmation of awards. In respect of the recommendations of the National Millennium Committee on a number of proposals for the floodlighting of churches, <Col N="832" /> including the project referred to by the Deputy, Government approval was received in mid-December 1999.</P>
    <P>Due to the heavy workload involved with the new year's eve celebrations, formal notification of the particular award has only recently been made. I understand the Deputy has been formally advised of the position at the same time.</P>

In addition to advising on projects and in response to proposals received, the millennium committee also made recommendations to the Government on the funding of events to mark the millennium, including on new year's eve.</P>
      <P>The major national event on new year's eve was the Last Light of the Millennium ceremony.

      <P>In the capital city, new year's eve was celebrated with a free concert which was organised at Merrion Square. This major event, which ran from 2.30 p.m. to 1.00 a.m., featured a wide range of artists including top names in the Irish music scene and attracted a total audience upwards of 40,000 people. In addition, the concert was a main feature on RTE's millennium broadcast during the day.</P>
      <P>New year's eve was also celebrated in Dublin with the permanent illumination of eleven bridges along the River Liffey, transforming the quays into &ldquo;a Liffey of Light&rdquo; culminating in a spectacular fireworks display in Dublin Bay to mark the beginning of the new millennium.</P>

      <P>The number of new apprentice registrations from September 1995 until September 1999 in trades within the construction industry rose from 2,517 to 5,281, an increase of about 110%. This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the demand for training places on the required off the job courses in FÁS and in particular in the Institutes of Technology. The increase in demand has led to difficulties with the timely placement of apprentices in off the job training because of the weight of numbers involved.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of the Construction Industry Federation and have discussed the current difficulties regarding off the job training places in FÁS and in the Institutes of Technology. FÁS and the education sector have responded to the shortage by significantly expanding their apprenticeship capacities. However, despite the significant increase in the number of places available for off the job training, there remain current capacity problems. The situation is being kept under close review by the board of FÁS and the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, and FÁS and the Department of Education and Science are intensifying their efforts to provide adequate places to meet the demand and to keep delays to a minimum.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals are also being considered by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee to address the capacity problems, in particular in relation to the education sector.</P>

      <P>The 1995 amendments, STCW 95, to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 1978, prescribe mandatory minimum requirements for the certification of engineer officers and engine-room watch ratings which are reflected in the implementing Irish legislation, the Merchant Shipping (Training and Certification) Regulations, 1998, SI No. 553 of 1998.</P>
      <P>Candidates for Irish certificates of competency have to meet certain medical standards, including eyesight; have satisfactorily completed the minimum period of seagoing service; reach the required vocational and academic standard; undertake some ancillary technical training, and in the case of officer candidates, on completion of programmes of education and training approved by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, pass an oral examination by a Department of the Marine and Natural Resources examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental principle of the STCW Convention is to ensure safe operation of merchant ships of different types. The convention requires <Col N="835" /> that the sea time for certification must be served on a merchant vessel for the purpose of qualifying for certification. While my Department recognises the quality of training received by Naval Officers and accepts that their academic training is quite adequate and acceptable, as these officers currently conduct their entire ship related training on naval vessels, they are unable to comply with the STCW Convention requirements regarding qualifying sea service.</P>
    <P>Discussions on this issue have, however, been taking place for some time now between my Department and the Department of Defence together with the Naval Service, with a view to identifying and developing a mechanism whereby engineering officers of the Naval Service may obtain appropriate certification for merchant shipping purposes provided they gain a certain amount of merchant vessel experience in addition to their Naval Service experience.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, as a result of this consultation, the marine survey office of my Department, which is responsible for the examination and certification of seafarers under the STCW Convention, expects to be in a position shortly to finalise implementation arrangements for a procedure whereby Naval Service Officers sea service can be recognised in part towards that required for merchant vessel certification.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 128 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1999 regular report from the Commission on Romania's progress towards accession to the European Union, including progress on <Col N="836" /> human rights and the protection of minorities, the European Commission evaluated that Romania in general fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, although this position will need to be re-examined if the authorities do not continue to give priority to dealing with the crisis in their child care institutions. Other areas which need particular attention, according to the Commission report, include the fight against corruption and, despite some positive developments, the situation of the Roma where, the Commission concludes, adequate budgetary resources should be made available and efforts should be made to fight discriminatory attitudes in society. The Commission will continue to evaluate the situation in Romania and will submit regular reports on progress achieved to the European Council.</P>
    <P>The 41 member states of the Council of Europe are expected to fully honour the standards and values of the Council, including the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Council is active not only in monitoring compliance by its member states with its standards, but also in providing practical assistance to ensure that these standards can be achieved.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the Council of Europe, Romania too has undertaken, in common with the other members of the Council, to accept the standards of the Council. Romania is also a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, the provisions of which provide for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Within the Council of Europe it is considered that Romania has made considerable progress towards the fulfilment of its obligations and commitments made on joining that organisation and continues to take steps to improve the functioning of democracy, respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>Persons within the jurisdiction of a member state of the Council of Europe may lodge a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. It is important to note that the European Convention on Human Rights provides that domestic remedies must be exhausted before a matter can be dealt with by the Court.</P>
    <P>With respect to Article 33 of the convention, while that Article enables any party to the convention to refer any alleged breach of the provisions of the convention by another party to the European Court of Human Rights, such action would not be realistic nor is there any precedent for taking such action against a party to the convention in the absence of specific allegations, together with supporting evidence, of human rights abuses or other breaches of the convention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of deferring deportation orders against Romanians, I cannot comment as the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>One of the most important challenges facing the international community is that of the debt burden on developing countries, especially the poorest. The debt repayments required of many heavily indebted poor countries or HIPC's greatly exceed development assistance flows. The efforts of many of the most impoverished countries to achieve sustainable development are frustrated by their level of indebtedness. This is clearly unacceptable and underlines the need for a positive and comprehensive response by the international community.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the extent of public support for the Jubilee 2000 Campaign which is calling for debt cancellation and I welcome their contribution in galvanising international support for greater action. The Government believes that it is necessary to look at every option including, where possible, debt cancellation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While recognised as well-intentioned, the HIPC debt initiative launched by the World Bank and IMF in 1996 failed to make a significant impact in the majority of the heavily indebted poor countries. There have, however, been posi<Col N="838" /> tive developments on the debt front over the course of recent months.</P>
    <P>The annual general meeting of the World Bank and IMF in Washington in September 1999 agreed an enhanced HIPC initiative which is a significant advance on its predecessor. By relaxing the criteria for eligibility, the new initiative is expected to double the amount of debt relief available under the initiative and to increase the number of recipient countries from 29 to 36. The enhanced initiative strengthens the relationship between debt relief and poverty alleviation. In this respect, it reflects one of the central points raised in our own national submission to the HIPC review. As part of the new initiative, each recipient country will produce a poverty reduction strategy paper, designed to ensure that the resources freed by debt relief will be of direct benefit to those in the greatest need.</P>
    <P>If it is to make a real difference, the enhanced HIPC must receive the funding it requires as soon as possible. Ireland is advocating that the most generous possible EU support be made available to the enhanced HIPC initiative. In that connection, we welcomed the decision taken on 8 December 1999 that the EU should contribute 1 billion euros to debt relief and the HIPC initiative as placing the EU in the lead role internationally in dealing with the issue. Ireland's share would amount to about six million euros.</P>
    <P>This does not, of course, amount to debt cancellation. The growing demand for cancellation by the Jubilee 2000 campaign and others is understandable in view of the impact the debt has on the poorest countries. The strength of international feeling on this issue is recognised and undoubtedly influenced the G7 in their decision to reform the HIPC initiative. Certainly debt cancellation should be explored by bilateral and multilateral donors whenever possible or feasible. Ireland strongly welcomed the recent decision of the British government to cancel 100% of the debts owed to it by HIPC countries. We would encourage other bilateral donors to take similar actions. Total cancellation does, however, raise a number of difficult and complex questions. Debt alleviation cannot be considered in isolation. Issues such as corruption, poor governance, internal conflict and human rights abuses can sometimes play a part. It is natural that creditor governments, who will be expected to pay very substantial moneys in support of debt relief, will want assurances that resources are directed to the alleviation of poverty.</P>
    <P>Many heavily indebted poor countries have undertaken major structural reforms to their economies to qualify for debt relief. Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, debt repayments by these countries should fall to a level which is sustainable and which do not deflect scarce resources from important social sectors such as health and education. There will be an extremely positive impact in recipient countries.</P>
    <P>Although not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries, Ireland strongly welcomes <Col N="839" /> measures, whether through debt relief or debt cancellation, aimed at easing the burden. At a national level, we have mobilised IR£31 million to help relieve the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries. We have contributed IR£9.5 million to debt relief in Tanzania and Mozambique, both of which are priority countries for Irish aid. Funds amounting to IR£22 million have been channelled through the World Bank and the IMF to finance the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to argue for a generous and flexible approach to heavily indebted poor countries by creditor nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies. Ireland will continue to press for a vigorous and intensified programme to address this major challenge to development.</P>

      <P>The request that the Department of Foreign Affairs obtain a civil marriage certificate from Rome was first made in a telephone call by the person concerned to the Department on 4 March 1999 and was immediately passed on to the embassy in Rome. When a written reminder of 20 October 1999 was received in the Department, the embassy was told by telephone that the request was still outstanding and was asked again to act on it.</P>
      <P>I regret to have to inform the Deputy that it was not until the matter was brought to the Department's and the embassy's attention again through his question that action was taken by the embassy. The embassy has contacted the parish in order to ascertain the date the marriage was registered in the civil register. That information is required by the <i>Commune De Roma</i> before they will issue a marriage certificate.</P>
      <P>I will make every endeavour to see that the person concerned receives the certificate within ten days.</P>

      <P>In recent years, the Radiological Protection Institute has issued numerous press releases, given interviews on radio and television and has participated in public meetings and press conferences concerning radon. In addition, it has published six reports detailing the results of its national survey on radon levels in domestic dwellings which was completed last July. In the last week, the institute announced the results of the first phase of its national survey on radon in schools. This survey was commissioned by the Minister for Education and Science. The second phase of this survey is under way. The Department of Education and Science is making arrangements for radon remediation measures to be taken in all schools where such measures are deemed necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> An advice booklet entitled Radon in Buildings produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government is available from the Government Publications Sale Office. This booklet provides advice to householders and builders on preventative and remedial measures which can be undertaken in new and existing buildings to reduce high radon concentrations.</P>
    <P>The Government is not in a position to provide funding this year for a scheme of grant assistance towards radon remediation works in households. I will keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to the earlier parliamentary question referred to by Deputy Kenny, I conveyed, as promised, to the Aer Lingus Chairman the concerns of the House at the cessation by Aer Lingus of their Knock-Birmingham service. The Deputy will also be aware that Aer Lingus has a strict commercial mandate from the Government and that it is not within my power to instruct the airline to operate any particular route. This is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airline.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked my Department to initiate the procedures necessary in order to introduce, before the end of this year, a public service obligation on the Knock-Dublin route under the essential air services programme.</P>
      <P>The introduction of such a route would serve to further improve accessibility and encourage the growth of both industry and tourism related activities in the west and north west.</P>

With effect from 1 April 2000, such quota holders will have the option of resuming milk production in their own right during the 2000/1 milk quota year or, should they choose, of selling the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on four breeding mares and one colt under the 1999 equine headage scheme. Under clause 6 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme, only breeding mares which are registered in the producer's name with the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society or in the Irish Horse Register are eligible for payment. The colt therefore was not eligible for payment and as three of the breeding mares were not registered in the producer's name, the person named incurred a 100% penalty in accordance with clause 27 of the terms and conditions and was advised accordingly by letter from my Department dated 13 January 2000.</P>
      <P>However, the case has now been reviewed and given that the three mares in question were paid on under the 1998 equine headage scheme, payment on the four mares applied on under the 1999 scheme will issue within the next 14 days. The person named should ensure that the animals are registered in her name in the year 2000 if she intends to submit these animals for equine headage.</P>

      <P>The person named <Col N="848" /> was paid his full entitlement of £1,095.19 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 28 September 1999. The grant was calculated in accordance with clause 26 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme which provides that an applicant qualifying for headage grants on beef cows may not receive more than £89.62 per hectare of the total forage area of the holding within the handicapped areas and not more than £55.99 per forage hectare in respect of headage grants on other animals. Under the 1999 cattle headage scheme the person named qualified for payment on 12 beef cows and 12 other animals based on total forage area of 15.31 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named also applied for premium on 11 cows under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on 31 May 1999. A 60% advance payment of £878.72 issued on 1 November 1999, in addition the person named was paid the euro compensation top-up of £77.99 on 20 December 1999 in respect of the 11 animals in question. Payment of a 40% balance will issue shortly.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted one 1999 application for special beef premium in respect of two animals on 28 October 1999.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application on which he declared 30.68 hectares of linseed in 1999. The case was selected for inspection in accordance with the selection criteria and the inspection revealed that an area of 4.83 hectares of linseed <Col N="849" /> was sown. This represented a difference of 25.85 hectares or an overclaim of 535%. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied where the difference is less than 3% or two hectares whichever is the lesser. The penalty is based on double the difference from the area found when the overclaim is between 3% and 20%, and when the difference is over 20% a 100% penalty must be applied. The penalty applicable in this case is 100%.</P>
      <P>A review of the inspection was requested by the applicant. When the review has been completed the results will be communicated to the person concerned.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 142 on 14 December 1999 the position is as follows.</P>
    <P>Under the 1997 suckler cow scheme the person named applied for premium on 38 cows on 28 May 1998. Following an on farm inspection carried out on 4 November 1999 it was established that ten of the animals on the claim were not properly tagged, consequently the animals in question were not eligible for premium. Payment of £3,926.44 in respect of the other 28 animals on the claim issued on 10 November 1998.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for premium on 47 cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme on 28 May 1998. Following an on farm inspection which took place on 23 July 1998 it was established that eleven of the animals on the claim had identification errors which resulted in them being deleted without penalty from the claim. It was therefore established that the applicant had an entitlement to payment on 36 animals The applicant was subsequently paid £3,814.25 on 27 October 1998, a further payment of £112.99 on 18 November 1998 and a final balance of £1,121.84 on 20 April 1999.</P>

Because of the volume of applications under the scheme which were received during 1999, there is a significant backlog. The applications on hands are being processed by local office staff in conjunction with other priority work.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that progress will be made in this case in the next month. I would point out that when the processing of an application is delayed in this way there is no financial loss to a retiring farmer. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171, 180 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>As of 1 October 1999 there were 754 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.7% of the total staff. That the number of people with disabilities across the Civil Service generally has dropped below the target of 3% continues to be a cause of concern. The heads of each Department and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% quota.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission is in the process of holding an open recruitment competition for clerical officers for people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability. A panel of suitably qualified people will be established through this competition. Applicants are being facilitated by the provision of enlarged scripts, braille and audio test material, interpreters for interviews, and wheelchair access to test and interview locations. Testing for this competition has now been completed and notifications for interviews will be issued within the next two to three weeks. As soon as a panel of qualified candidates becomes available for appointment, each head of Department will be encouraged to draw from that panel when recruiting clerical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 3% relates to the Civil Service as a whole. It is not always possible to ensure that <Col N="853" /> each Department individually fulfils the 3% quota at all times. For example, the regular and ongoing movement of staff between Departments may impact on the quota at any given time. In addition, a number of positions across the Civil Service may not be as suited to those with certain types of disabilities. For practical reasons therefore, in monitoring the number of disabled staff, the aim at present is to achieve an overall quota of 3%.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
    <P>Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures. The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee representative of staff and management. In addition, in the context of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service, equality initiatives relating to the employment of people with disabilities are being developed.</P>

To qualify for relief under the scheme, an applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>

      <P>The seaside resort scheme was announced in the 1995 budget and commenced on 1 July 1995. It was extended on two occasions and terminated on 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to extend this scheme beyond that date or to designate other areas under a similar scheme as it has fulfilled its purpose by encouraging a large volume of investment in the 15 designated seaside areas. The tax cost of the scheme is provisionally estimated at £250 million to £300 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to the cost implications of a further extension to the scheme, I had to take account of the fact that the new regional aid scheme for all EU countries commenced on 1 January 2000 and the seaside resort scheme had to finish before that date for EU related reasons. The state aids section of the EU Commission has written recently to my Department seeking information on the scheme in response to a complaint about the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the companies concerned were written to in October 1999. The position as at 27 January 2000 is as follows. Of the 38,996 companies concerned, 5,512 have at this stage made the required return to the Revenue Commissioners. A further 9,389 returns have been sent back to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the addressee is unknown; these companies are being checked to establish whether up-to-date addresses can be found. This leaves a total of 24,095 companies from which no response has been received. These cases are also being examined to check whether, in the event, they have registered for tax in the interim.</P>
      <P>It is intended to complete this examination shortly and to forward a list of all those companies which have failed to provide the required information to the Registrar of Companies so as to enable him to initiate strike-off procedures.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, contains the company law part of the package of measures to deal with IRNR companies. As part of this, prior to registration of new companies, the Registrar of Companies must be satisfied that the company will carry on an activity in the State.</P>
      <P>I believe that the measures to deal with the IRNR problem, which I introduced in last year's Finance Act, and the changes to company law will prove to be effective in containing and eliminating this problem.</P>

    <P>Specified Rate for bank/financial institution employees in respect of Principal Private Residence Loans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Where a bank-financial institution, whose trade partly consists of making principal private residence loans for a fixed number of years at a fixed rate of interest, gives a loan to an employee of the bank-financial institution to purchase a principal private residence at a fixed rate of interest for the full duration of the loan, and the rate charged to non-employees on such a loan is less than the specified rate of 6%, then the specified rate for the purposes of calculating benefit-in-kind, is the rate charged to non-employees.</P>
    <P>For all other principal private residence loans, the specified rate is 6%.</P>
    <P>Example 1: Principal Private Residence Loan</P>
    <P>Bank X gives an employee a loan of £40,000 at a fixed rate of interest of 3% over 20 years. The loan is used to purchase a dwelling house which will be the employee's principal private residence. The individual is single, and is a first time buyer.</P>
    <P>At the time the preferential loan was given to the employee, it is not general practice for the bank to make principal private residence loans to non-employees at a fixed rate of interest for the full duration of a loan.</P>
    <P>The specified rate in this case is 6%. The benefit in kind charge is as follows:</P>
    <P>Interest payable at 6%: £40,000 X 6% = £2,400</P>
    <P>Less interest actually paid: £40,000 X 3% = £1.200</P>
    <P>Benefit in kind Charge £1,200, (chargeable at the employee's marginal rate of tax)</P>
    <P>Income tax relief will be due on the mortgage interest payable at the specified rate. £40,000 x 6% = £2,400</P>
    <P>This relief is available at the current standard rate of tax (24%).</P>
    <P>Example 2: Principal Private Residence Loan</P>
    <P>As above, except that at the time the preferential loan was given to the employee, it is general practice for the bank to make principal private residence loans to non-employees at a fixed rate of interest for the duration of a loan, and the rate of interest charged on such loans is 5%. (It should be noted that this rarely arises in practice).</P>
    <P>The specified rate is 5%, and the benefit in kind charge is as follows:</P>
    <P>Interest payable at 5%: £40,000 X 5% = £2,000.</P>
    <P>Less interest actually paid: £40,000 X 3% = £1,200</P>
    <P>Benefit in kind Charge £800, chargeable at the employee's marginal rate of tax</P>
    <P>Income tax relief will be due on the mortgage interest payable at the specified rate. £40,000 x 5% = £2,000</P>
    <P>This relief is available at the current standard rate of tax 24%.</P>
    <P>Example 3: Other Loans</P>
    <P>Bank X gives an employee a loan of £10,000 at a rate of interest of 4%. The loan is used to purchase a car.</P>
    <P>The specified rate in this case is 10%. The benefit in kind charge is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Interest payable at specified rate 10%: £10,000 X 10% = £1,000</P>
    <P>Less interest actually paid: £10,000 X 3% = £300</P>
    <P>Taxable benefit in kind £700 (chargeable at the employee's marginal rate of tax).</P>
    <P>There is no income tax relief due in respect of the interest paid, as it is not a qualifying loan that is, principle private residence loan or a loan used to acquire an interest in a private company.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. There are three neurologists in the Southern Health Board area: two at Cork University Hospital and one at the Mercy Hospital, Cork. The additional information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department. However, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board and the secretary-manager of the Mercy Hospital to reply to the Deputy directly on the matter.</P>
      <P>The appointment of additional staff is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance. However, I will continue to sanction additional appointments in accordance with the priority identified by the agencies in the Southern Health Board area and in the context of available funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of bed closures and resulting bed days lost in 1999 are set out in the following table. It should be noted that, for the purposes of accurate comparison, the figures exclude closures which occurred as a result of the nurses' strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery <Col N="861" /> of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level.</P>
    <P>In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and <Col N="862" /> the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas.</P>
    <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1998 was 809,099. At out-patient level, the figures show that 1,960,126 attendances were recorded in that period. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of 3% over 1997 levels. This upward trend in overall activity continued in the first nine months of 1999. Overall discharges, in-patient and day case, were up 4.18% over the same period in 1998, which include an increase in day cases of 12%. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in recent times hospitals providing accident and emergency services have experienced increased activity. However, it is important to note that while patients may experience delays in accident and emergency departments, every effort is made by the staff to keep these delays to a minimum and to ensure that appropriate medical treatment is provided to all patients at all times.</P>
      <P>A contributing factor to the delays for patients who are awaiting admission from accident and emergency departments to acute hospitals is the number of patients who are inappropriately occupying acute hospital beds. The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative indicated that a significant proportion of such beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>As part of a package of measures to address these problems the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Dublin acute hospitals which provide accident and emergency services, were asked to examine this particular aspect of the service and to formulate a response. The board submitted a comprehensive action plan which takes into account the complex group of patients who need a mixture of sub-acute care services. This group include young chronic sick, physical rehabilitation cases, medical rehabilitation patients and elderly patients. The implementation of the plan, which provides an additional 235 alternative care places to cater for patients across the spectrum, has already been agreed and 205 of the places are already <i>in situ</i>. The remaining 30 will be in place by early February 2000. These 235 places can be broken down as follows: 70 sub-acute-convalescent places, 25 young chronic sick places and 140 long stay contract nursing home places.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the number of empty beds in the Meath Hospital, Dublin 8, which could be used for long-term care of the elderly.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, services provided at the Meath Hospital transferred to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, on the opening of that hospital in June 1998. The Eastern Health Board subsequently negotiated a lease on the Meath Hospital for the purpose of commissioning and opening a much needed 60 bed sub-acute unit for older people. This service development was essential to ensure that St James's Hospital would have additional support to meet demands upon it following the opening of the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The Meath Hospital was later purchased by the Eastern Health Board in late 1999 to provide for the development of a range of important services on a permanent basis. This initiative will focus on the provision of critical services to the local elderly population, and in supporting nearby general hospitals.</P>
      <P>The proposals for the development on the Meath Hospital campus are as follows:</P>
      <P>The 50 bed unit for older people the range of in-patient services in this unit will include: sub-acute-convalescent care for patients who have completed the acute phase of their medical care; respite-intermittent care for patients being cared for at home but who require short-term planned admission for non-acute care-assessment and-or to give &ldquo;home carers&rdquo; respite; and long stay care for patients who have been medically assessed as no longer capable of being cared for in their own home environment.</P>
      <P>25 bed facility for secondary rehabilitation is for older persons who, having completed the acute phase of their treatment, require continuing intensive rehabilitation over a planned period of time prior to being discharged back into their own home environment with appropriate community support.</P>
      <P>The 60 long stay places currently in situation at the Meath Hospital will be redesigned and together with the additional 15 places will enable the ranges of inpatient services as described above to be provided.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is setting up a register for people who would benefit from a regular attendance at a day care unit. It is expected that up to 20 patients a day would attend such a unit. The range of facilities available will be needs based. However, it is expected that physiotherapy will be provided.</P>
      <P>On general practitioner's treatment unit, the Eastern Health Board proposal is to provide support services for the south inner city primary care unit &ndash; 29 participating general practitioners &ndash; and will include a minor injuries unit and wound dressing clinic. The services will be provided out of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that consultant led out-patient <Col N="867" /> clinics will be managed by consultants based in St James's Hospital. The range of specialities and frequency of the clinics are still to be decided and will depend on the needs identified in this area.</P>
    <P>Various community services will be provided for that part of the south inner city from the multipurpose health centre facility, including public health nursing, community welfare, dental, home helps, social work, paramedical services etc.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric day hospital and psychiatric out-patient clinic services will be consultant-led and will operate Monday to Friday during normal working hours.</P>
    <P>Officials at my Department are working with the Eastern Health Board to examine in greater detail the optimum use of the site so that appropriate health services are delivered in the most effective manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no spare bed capacity in acute hospitals or in hospitals or extended care facilities in the Dublin region for older people who require long-term care.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that 164 older persons were occupying acute hospital beds in the Eastern Health Board region on 23 January 2000. These people have completed the acute phase of their illnesses and have been medically assessed as being in need of long-term care. The Eastern Health Board has also informed me that there would also be approximately 60 older people in a community setting at any one time who have been medically assessed in the various departments of medicine for the elderly as requiring long-term care in the short to medium term. Following their assessment the older people are reviewed on a regular basis in the day hospital attached to the departments of medicine for the elderly to monitor their progress and their priority need for long-term care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a planned approach to ensure the optimal utilisation of the acute bed resource in the region, the Eastern Health Board submitted a proposal to my Department in early 1999 which was designed to complement the established programme of expansion of extended care places for older people who occupy acute hospital beds inappropriately. It takes into account the complex <Col N="868" /> group of patients, which includes older people, who need a mixture of sub-acute care services.</P>
    <P>The plan, which allowed for the provision of an additional 234 extended care places for patients across the spectrum, 140 of which were long-stay contract nursing home places for older people, was agreed to and implemented with additional funding provided by my Department for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that it has adopted a strategy ageing with confidence for the people of Cork and Kerry and this strategy envisages the community hospital as the focal point for the provision and delivery of care including such services as acute care, rehabilitation, respite, palliative and continuing care. The board recognises that significant investment, together with the development of resources, including community and district hospitals, is required to ensure that these are appropriate to the delivery of care and allow for a wider access to a range of services for the older person. Detailed plans for the implementation of the strategy are in the final stages of preparation and will include Bandon Community Hospital within the context as outlined above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the particular issue of Bandon, I understand that the local voluntary fund-raising group has collected approximately £30,000  towards the cost of providing a day room at the community <Col N="869" /> hospital. I am advised that the Southern Health Board is preparing a submission to my Department concerning the balance of the funding needed to carry out such work. I will give careful consideration to the board's application when it is received.</P>

      <P>As the Minister, Deputy Fahey, outlined to the House last week, the Adoption Board is an independent statutory body with primary responsibility for matters related to adoption. The reasoning behind the Adoption Board's decision has already been elaborated on in detail. I know that this important issue was given careful consideration by the board before any decision was made. The board's experience and expertise in this area is well established and together with its independent status I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to intervene.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of discrimination against adoptive parents, it is considered that in the context of inter-country adoptions it is in the best interest of the child that the parents should fall within the new age limits. I also note that the Adoption Board has pointed out that approximately 90% of couples who have applied to have their inter-country adoptions recognised under Irish law or to have Irish adoption orders made where the board was not in a position to recognise their inter-country adoptions, have come within the board's guidelines on age.</P>

These contracts provide for the implementation and enforcement of the relevant legislation by the official agencies, acting as agents of the authority.</P>
      <P>In the case of the health boards, the activities covered by the service contracts include the inspection of catering, food retailing premises as well as those wholesaling, distribution and manufacturing premises coming under their control. It is not possible to separate the numbers assigned to inspecting each type of premises.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212, 230 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>Part M of the building regulations, which have been in effect since 1 June 1992, places a duty on persons constructing or extending public buildings to provide access for people with disabilities. Compliance with the regulations is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the buildings involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local building control authorities are statutorily responsible for enforcement of the regulations. Since my appointment as Minister in 1997, I have been urging local authorities to more actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including Part M. In particular, Circular Letter BC 7/99 on 17 June 1999 specifically called for <Col N="874" /> stricter enforcement of Part M. I understand that 35 out of 37 authorities have now appointed officers; and the balance are in the process of making such appointments. I have also increased building control fees to provide local authorities with additional revenue to fund better enforcement.</P>
    <P>In July 1999 I issued a consultation document on my proposal to require all new dwellings commencing on or after 1 July 2000 to be accessible to disabled visitors. At the same time, I indicated that the whole of Part M was being thrown open for review and amendment. I intend to publish the revised and improved Part M within the next three months, following consideration of a wide range of comments received and having consulted with the building regulations advisory body. When the definitive Part M measures are published, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, will be holding a series of regional seminars throughout the country dealing with the revised Technical Guidance Document M.</P>
    <P>In my foreword to the consultation document on Part M, I summed up my own views on the enforcement of Part M as follows:</P>
    <P>I hope that Part M, when amended and vigorously enforced, will deliver greatly improved accessibility to all our citizens including people with disabilities, in the new millennium and not before its time.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Sale of Houses) Regulations, 1995, governs the sale of rented houses by local authorities to tenants and provide that the purchase price is the market value as determined by the local authority in its existing state of repair and condition. Discounts of 3% on the value of the house are allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of ten years, plus an additional discount of £3,000. Valuations stand for a maximum period of one year or such lesser period as the local authority may determine. Any improvements carried out by the tenant are disregarded in calculating the sale price. A tenant may contest a local authority valuation by submitting a valuation certificate from a qualified valuer in support of the claim. In the event of significant variation between the two valuations the local authority may refer the matter to the Valuation Office for adjudication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the purchase of private houses as part of the local authority housing programme local authorities have been advised that they may purchase private houses where the cost of the acquisition can be met from the authority's capital allocation and the acquisition represents a cost effective and economical means by which the authority can meet the housing needs of persons who have been included in the last assessment of <Col N="876" /> housing need or who have been accepted for inclusion in the next assessment.  The approval of the Department is not required for individual purchases or sales to tenants. Detailed information is not therefore available in my Department on the sale and purchase price of local authority dwellings. However such prices would vary greatly having regard to the condition and location of houses at the time of sale or purchase discounts in the case of sales to tenants etc. and the general rate of price increases in the locality.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the policy guidance outlined in Changing our Ways, emerging regional waste management plans provide for the development of an integrated network of waste management infrastructure, including facilities for thermal treatment of waste.</P>
      <P>To inform the development and implementation of these waste management plans, two EU-funded feasibility studies were carried out in 1998 on thermal treatment-recovery options as one element in an integrated approach towards waste management. These studies examined the technical, environmental and financial advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment in two distinct rural regions, the north-east and mid-west, and in the greater Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The studies considered three thermal treatment options, waste incineration with energy recovery  &ndash; WTE &ndash;  gasification and pyrolysis, under a range of criteria.  At the time, the consultants concluded,<i> inter alia</i>, that WTE is a safe, tried and tested technology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards; gasification and pyrolysis are emerging technologies which are continuing to be developed to the scale likely to be appropriate in Irish circumstances; gasification offers environmental advantages over WTE, including lower emissions; gasification does not have the same track record as WTE, but appears to be close to becoming proven as a treatment method for municipal wastes; and pyrolysis may have future potential in certain applications but is not currently suitable as a bulk treatment method for municipal wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our major infrastructural requirements in the waste area can best be addressed through the establishment of public-private partnerships &ndash; PPP &ndash; delivering integrated regional solutions. Private participation in waste management can contribute not just capital investment, but specialist expertise in the application of alternative and emerging technologies. As local authorities <Col N="877" /> address the implementation of regional waste management plans, it may be expected that PPP proposals will emerge which reflect the state of the art in, and relative merits of, available waste technologies.</P>
    <P>The position in this regard, including the need and scope for support of a technologically innovative process, such as gasification, in a pilot basis, will be kept under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>The following is my position in relation to the concerns stated in the details to the question: I have raised the issue of the removal of VRT and VAT from wheelchair accessible taxis with my colleague, the Minister for Finance. Concerns have been expressed to me by taxi interests about the need to improve taxi fare structures in <Col N="878" /> the Dublin taximeter area and I have agreed to take this issue up with the competent Dublin local authorities. For the purpose of the implementation of the Government proposals for increased taxis in Dublin no alteration of the current Dublin taximeter area is envisaged.  The organisation and marketing of taxi services are primarily matters for the taxi industry. I have, however, indicated that my Department is prepared to offer support for the carrying out of an integrated study on desirable improvements in the quality of taxi service operations. On 13 January 2000 I made regulations which establish an application process for all existing taxi licence holders in Dublin to apply for the grant of either a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence from Dublin Corporation. Applications must be received by the corporation on or before 18 February 2000. In the light of the responses which emerge I will be prepared to consider further the arrangements for allocating licences under the scheme which I will finalise shortly. The above regulations are intended to address taxi licences for issue in the present year and suspend the delegation of certain powers to Dublin local authorities. It is however envisaged that Dublin Corporation should re-assume full regulation of taxis and maintain the equilibrium of taxi supply and demand into the future.</P>

      <P>The current licence fees for dogs are provided for in the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act, 1992, which came into operation on 1 February 1999.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people and to people living alone, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities, who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence. Similar difficulties are likely to arise with a scheme to allow pensioners with more than one dog to have only one licence.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (National Car Test) regulations, 1999, do not apply to the roadworthiness testing of small public service vehicles. It is proposed to review these arrangements later this year, in consultation with the Garda authorities, with a view to the transfer of such vehicle testing to the new national car test.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Garda Commissioner remains the appropriate vehicle testing authority for small public service vehicles and my Department has confirmed this position to the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>Under the SWA scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less the nominal sum of £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>People seeking a rent supplement from a health board must first satisfy the health board that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. Secondly, the health board must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has advised that the person concerned sold their house in <Col N="885" /> September 1999 and applied for rent supplement in November 1999. The application for a rent supplement was disallowed by the health board on the grounds that in selling their house the person knowingly deprived themselves of accommodation and did not fulfil the conditions for receipt of rent supplement as required under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The person concerned lodged an appeal against this decision with the health board appeals office on 26 January 2000 and the case will be determined as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments in recent years has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis </i>the employment status of the parent(s). Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy approach, substantial additional resources have been invested in the child benefit scheme since this Government came into office. The full-year costs of the increases provided for in the 1998 budget amounted to some £28.4 million, while the 1999 budget included a full-year provision of over £40 million.</P>
      <P>More recently, the 2000 budget provides for a full-year investment of some £106 million in the child benefit scheme. From September of this year, the child benefit rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement, provided they continue to meet the normal conditions for eligibility. This is to ensure as far <Col N="886" /> as possible that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>There are 1,164 widows and widowers between 60 and 65 years of age who are in receipt of free electricity/gas allowance and free TV licence under this special provision. There are 454 free telephone rental allowances in payment to this group, of which all but 22 clients also have entitlement to free electricity/gas allowance. Overall, there are 13,356 widows and widower pensioners in this age range, from which it can be derived that approximately 12,192 of this group do not have any free scheme entitlements under current rules. The cost of extending the schemes in these cases is estimated at £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes and the target groups to be covered. The question of any further extension of the schemes to groups not yet covered would have to be considered in the context of that review and of overall budgetary considerations.</P>

Under existing legislation, payment of the deserted wife's allowance, which she had been receiving up to 1990, cannot be restored.</P>
      <P>I intend providing in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, which will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly, that deserted wife's allowance will be restored in cases such as this, provided the conditions which applied to recipients of the allowance are satisfied.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the social welfare appeals process is quasi-judicial and is governed by legislation and case law and the equally binding requirements of natural justice and the courts. These procedures, statutory and otherwise, are designed to ensure that every appeal gets due and fair consideration. Such a process is inevitably time consuming.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process appeals during the past year was 21 weeks. While this did not represent any deterioration on the 1998 position, the substantial increase in the number of appeals received in 1999 &ndash; up by over 10% on the 1998 figure &ndash; meant that no inroads in the processing time could be achieved.</P>
      <P>Two additional appeals officers were appointed in 1997 to deal with a then increasing workload and I have assigned two more this month. There may be a time lag before these increases are reflected in reduced waiting periods but it is anticipated that improvement can be achieved within the next few months.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April, regardless of the temperature. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20% in the last six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. A sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme for the 1999-2000 fuel season.</P>
      <P>Based on the estimates for the current fuel season the cost of extending the fuel season by one week would be approximately £1.8 million or £46.4 million to extend it for the full year. As such an extension to the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications this could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account. The Deputy will note that the primary weekly payments have increased by £18 per week since this Government came into office.</P>
      <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>In the case of late claims to free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance, current practice in relation to late claims is to backdate for up to two years in addition to the year in which the claim is made. This practice is under review at present in the light of the changes made in the backdating provisions affecting contributory pensions. This review will be completed shortly and the practice will be further considered in the light of the conclusions.</P>

      <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements. The issue of extending the free schemes to retired public servants is being addressed as part of the review process.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the Policy Institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series in March 2000.</P>
      <P>Since July 1996 the free schemes are available to low income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, currently £89 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £94 for a recipient aged 80 years or over, plus £30, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate. The make-up of this income limit means that it increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates. The annual cost of increasing the means disregard on the free schemes means test to £100 per week is not available.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 made provision for the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes will be extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance giving this group access to all the free schemes. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000.</P>
      <P>Government Departments do not subsidise the free schemes for ex-employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment, of £6 per week, to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> In line with this Government's commitment to a strong social welfare pension based on social insurance, and the achievement of an old age non-contributory pension rate of £100 per week by 2002, I have concentrated on improving the personal pension rates of our older people. I believe this to be the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved.</P>
    <P>In this regard, significant progress has been made towards achieving this objective since this Government took up office. For instance, the recent budget provides for an increase of £7 per week in personal pension rates &ndash; well above the average inflation rate. Taken together with the improvements in the 1998 and 1999 budgets, this means that all pensions have been increased by £18 per week since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of aligning the tax and social welfare changes from the start of April by 2001, the Government has brought forward the implementation date of the budget increases by six weeks from mid-June to the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    <P>Any increase in the rate of payment would have to be considered in the light of the modest increase overall in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was set, taking into account the substantial increases in primary payment rates over the same period.</P>
    <P>To increase the current £5 per week rate by £1 per week for the whole of the fuel season would cost approximately £7.2 million per annum and to increase the rate from £5 to £20 would cost an additional £108 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. With regard to the payment rate, the group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 with further increases of either £4 or £7 which will come into effect from May 2000.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>RTE reports that in some parts of West Cork, television reception is marginal. RTE states that it had a coverage extension programme which was planned for completion by the end of 1999.

      <P>Under the 1994-99 EU community support framework, there was a provisional allocation of £2 million made under the tourism operational programme for the construction of the visitor centre and development of the national park. However the EU regulations specified that the project had to be fully completed by the end of 1999. When it became clear that this deadline could not be met this project was decommitted as I outlined in my replies of 24 Feabhra and 31 Márta 1998 to ceisteanna Nos. 270 to 272, inclusive, and 214 and 215 respectively. Some £143,969 had been spent on the project previously in minor preparatory works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now allocated £3 million for this project under the national development plan. The sites offered for the visitor centre to be located at Ballycroy have been assessed and narrowed down to those most suitable. Once a definite site has been selected its acquisition and the subsequent planning and design of the centre will be processed in the normal manner. Some £200,000 has been <Col N="894" /> allocated towards purchasing a site, planning, design work, etc. in the current year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible or realistic to attempt to quantify this figure. The reality in this area as in many other areas involving Exchequer expenditure is that the level of demand can always be expected to exceed the resources that can actually be made available. However, the Arts Council's second arts plan covering the period 1999-2001 sets out a budget requirement of £100 million for its implementation over the period in question.  The Government has approved the plan and I am providing the necessary funding to facilitate the Arts Council to implement the plan in full.  I am also able to advise the Deputy that I have allocated resources from my Department's Estimate in 2000 towards the establishment, in conjunction with the music industry, of the music board of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, published in November 1999, the Government is committed to providing resources for the further development of the State's arts and culture infrastructure. I am currently developing a new capital scheme which will support regional, urban and community based projects as well as the redevelopment of existing cultural infrastructural facilities. I would hope formally to launch this initiative in the near future.  </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for meeting the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities rests with each Government Department and the individual public sector body or agency concerned. My Department is responsible for monitoring progress towards achieving this target in the public sector other than the Civil Service. To this end, a monitoring committee is working to support and advise in relation to the attainment of the target. The committee is chaired by my Department and is composed of representatives of each Department, of the social partners under Partnership 2000 and of the relevant interest groups.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people with disabilities employed in the public sector, other than the Civil Service, has increased from 1.49% in 1995, to 1.52% in 1997 and to 1.7% in 1998. The latter figure represents 3.50 persons out of the total staff of 178,980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring committee has sought to advance progress through: a survey of the position as at 31 December 1998; endorsing a model of code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities as being suitable for adoption or modification by each public sector body or agency under the aegis of a Government Department. The code was launched in September 1999 by my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, for use in the local authority service; Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at my Department, who has special responsibility for equality and disabilities issues, has written to each Minister requesting their active support in progressing the adoption of codes of practice in relation to the <Col N="900" /> public sector bodies and agencies under the aegis of their own Department.</P>
    <P>Future work of the monitoring committee will include: advising on the conduct of a survey of ascertain progress towards the attainment of the target since the last survey; and identifying reasons for the success by some bodies in achieving the 3% target, as well as the failure in other areas to do so.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor, support and advise public sector bodies and agencies in working to achieve the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>There are currently 1,040 transfer applications in respect of basic grade prison officers on hand at present. Included in this figure are multiple applications from individual officers who have applied to be transferred to a number of prisons.</P>
      <P>Prison officers are recruited for general prison service, and conditions of service make it clear that they may be assigned to any prison or place of detention, as required. The current recruitment campaign which commenced in late 1997 has been specifically to staff the new prisons at Castlerea, Mountjoy Women's, Cloverhill and the midland's &ndash; Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>Officers are initially assigned to prisons depending on the exigencies of the service. In general, subsequent transfers are effected on a seniority basis. The length of time an officer is required to wait before a transfer application is successful depends on a number of factors, namely, the location sought and whether, in fact, there are any vacancies, the officer's seniority and the existing waiting list for transfers to the prison concerned. In general most applications are in respect of prisons located outside the Dublin city area where vacancies will be infrequent, and applicants are required to wait longer than is the case in respect of Dublin city-based institutions.</P>

    <P>The grounds upon which asylum applicants from Nigeria base their claim for asylum are varied and cover the full spectrum of the grounds stipulated in the Geneva Convention, namely, race; religion; nationality; membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>Each application for asylum is considered on its merits, taking into consideration the information supplied by the applicant in his or her completed questionnaire, at interview and any submissions made by or on behalf of the applicant. Also taken into account is the general situation in the country of origin as it pertains to the applicant's grounds for claiming asylum. For this purpose, my Department obtains information from,<i> inter alia</i>, the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the US State Department, the Canadian Boards of Immi<Col N="904" /> gration, other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources. A research and documentation centre is available in the Refugee Application Centre as a research facility for this Department and the legal representatives of asylum seekers. This documentation centre is administered by the Refugee Legal Service in co-operation with the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Applications for asylum are considered in confidence to safeguard against the possibility of any risk arising to a possible refugee through it becoming known to the applicant's alleged persecutor of his or her whereabouts. It has been my Department's policy not to inquire of countries of origin about individual asylum seekers as this would be contrary to the assurance given to asylum seekers that their cases will be dealt with in confidence.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any views held in Nigeria that asylum seekers from that country are needed at home in Nigeria or that they are not in fact refugees.</P>

      <P>Finglas is one of six locations that have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing by the CCTV advisory committee.</P>
      <P>I am aware that delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects while the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant &ndash; with applications being received from almost 40 communities throughout the country. The Deputy is aware that a shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems &ndash; particularly in each of the prioritised locations. Notwithstanding the shortage of technicians, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I, therefore, decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area and to also quantify in precise terms the benefits of CCTV in city centre areas. The review is expected to be completed soon and its findings will then be submitted for consideration.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin to include Grafton Street and its surrounding streets and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The order in which the remaining priority locations &ndash; including Finglas &ndash; will be undertaken has not yet been decided. I can confirm that while it is intended to commence the planning and implementation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible, it is not possible at this stage to give a definitive timescale in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 294, 304, 317, 340, and 341 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background information, I wish to point out that the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training, which was introduced in October 1994 and fully <Col N="909" /> operational since 1998, is funded by the Department of Health. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non-means tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children consulted with a number of colleges in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes, which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of part-time degree programmes have been introduced on a self-financing basis and I understand that it is open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Part-time courses do not come within the scope of the free fees initiative. I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway, has introduced a one year full-time nursing degree programme for students who have completed the three year nursing diploma programme. As the Deputies will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children has stated that his Department is not in a position to meet the fees of students undertaking this programme.</P>
    <P>This degree course has not been included within the scope of my Department's free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others <i>v</i>. the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter. I would refer to the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will involve a 12 month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The commission further recommended that no third level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the 2002-03 academic year. The Nursing Education Forum has been established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year pre-registration nursing degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <P>The managerial authority of the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for sanction to appoint a teacher for the Sraith Gaelach in 1996. The application was considered by my Department at that time. The staffing allocation of the school fully reflected its entitlement under the staffing schedule. Accordingly, the board of management was advised by letter of 12 August 1996 that it was not possible to approve the application for additional staffing. Due to industrial action within my Department I am not in a position to confirm whether a more recent application has been received from the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition to which the Deputy refers is generally diagnosed by a speech and language therapist or medical specialist. The speech of a pupil with verbal apraxia may not be fluent and there is defective phonology. Children suffering from the condition can be difficult to understand and there can be associated learning disability in terms of acquiring literacy skills.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the extent of the condition in question among school children. Pupils with more severe forms of this condition are generally enrolled in special classes dedicated to children with speech and language disorders. Such classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 7:1 and have the support of a speech therapy service provided by the relevant health board. Children attending such classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding. My Department will continue to provide such classes in any area where a need for such provision has been identified.</P>
      <P>Individual children with less severe forms of the condition in question can be catered for in mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis, with the support where necessary of the remedial or resource teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remedial teaching service has been extended to all first and second level schools from the commencement of the current school year. I would also point out that arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children <Col N="911" /> assessed as having special educational needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to special support services. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 642 child care assistants to support children with special needs in the primary system.</P>
    <P>All primary schools have been advised of this development and of the procedures to be followed by schools in seeking support for special needs pupils. My Department is responding to requests for such support on an ongoing basis and will continue to make the relevant resources available to support such pupils, including those with verbal apraxia. However, in the case of children with verbal apraxia, the input of the speech and language therapist will continue to be of particular importance.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency was established in autumn 1999 and recruitment of additional psychologists to staff the service is well advanced. It is hoped that all posts sanctioned for 1999, plus appointments to fill vacancies caused by resignations, will be filled shortly. The selection process for a further cohort of psychologists to be appointed during the current year is nearing completion by the Civil Service Commission. It is intended that these further psychologists should be in post by the end of summer 2000. It is envisaged that pupils in all schools will have access to the service by the end of a five-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues which is being considered by the agency is the question of how interim support may be provided to students and schools that do not yet have access to the service. My Department has held discussions with the Department of Health and Children in relation to the undertaking by the health boards of urgent psychological assessments during the development phase of <Col N="912" /> the National Educational Psychological Service. The two Departments concerned will make every effort to arrive at an early satisfactory solution to this interim difficulty. The needs of the student referred to have been brought to the attention of the agency.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. When assessing income from self-employment/farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit/loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. These means test arrangements, which have been in operation since 1983, are of general application. There are no plans to alter the method of computing reckonable income for the purposes of the student support schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second-level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Computer equipment and software are items that may be provided. Under the terms of the scheme the school auth<Col N="916" /> orities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. I understand that no application has been received by my Department in respect of the student in question. My officials have been in touch with the school authorities to ensure that the school is fully informed about the scheme and to advise the school to submit an application on behalf of the student. I understand that the student has already been assessed and that the school has all the relevant documentation. The application once received will be processed by my Department without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the ESF aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The ESF aided middle level technician programme consists of one and two year courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical/business skills programme consists of three year national diploma and one year &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; diploma level courses. The programmes apply to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects.</P>
      <P>The European Social Fund aided maintenance grants scheme applies to eligible students attending such courses. In general a student can receive grant aid for the approved duration of one ESF aided course. However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, a student can be grant aided where, he or she having passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, wishes to transfer to a different course. In these circumstances the student can be grant aided for the normal duration of the new course.</P>
      <P>Similarly, students who receive grant aid for a one year ESF aided course and are progressing to a further course can be assisted for the subsequent two or three years of a related MLT course or HTBS course. Students who are grant aided for a two year MLT course and having successfully competed the course gain admission, by exemption, to year two of an indirectly related HTBS course, can be grant aided for the remaining two years of that course. Furthermore, students who are grant aided for a two year MLT course can be grant-aided for the third &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; year of a related HTBS course. Outside of these circumstances, students are not eligible for grant assistance for two unrelated ESF aided courses.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation to which the Deputy refers. My predecessor recently launched a £194 million plan to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. A key objective of this plan is to ensure that support services for disadvantaged pupils are properly targeted at those most in need.</P>
      <P>Traditional approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage have lacked the necessary flexibility to target individual and small groups of pupils suffering educational disadvantage. The system has tended to concentrate resources on schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils, while failing to give adequate support to other schools with smaller but nonetheless serious pockets of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Under the New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity &ndash; it is intended that all primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers, will be surveyed to identify the precise distribution of disadvantaged pupils across the system. This survey will be carried out during the current school term.</P>
      <P>In response to the levels of disadvantage identified through the survey, additional supports will be made available to schools to meet the needs of their pupils. The level and nature of the support services made available will vary depending on the level of need identified.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to attach particular priority to the issue of educational disadvantage and to ensure that an efficient and effective system of support for disadvantaged pupils is put in place by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Mol an Óige &ndash; Ar Aghaidh Linn &ndash; plan was received in my Department recently. The plan is now being studied by my officials and they will be in contact with key people in Tipperary about the plan in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance that this Government and my Department attach to the issue of educational disadvantage and school retention. A range of supports for schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage have been put in place over recent years so that young people at risk of early school leaving can be supported and retained until they attain certification in the educational system. These supports reflect well my Department's emphasis on preventative actions and positive discrimination in favour of young people at risk.</P>
      <P>More recently my Department announced the stay in school retention initiative at second level. The initiative will provide funding to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools in collaboration with local statutory and voluntary agencies and agreed with my Department. The plans, which will provide for a range of in-school and out-of-school actions will address the needs of targeted young people at risk. They will specify clear targets in terms of increased retention up to the end of the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>Fifty eight schools are participating in the first phase of the initiative and it is intended to invite a further selection of schools to participate in the second phase during 2000.</P>
      <P>Further, in December 1999, the Taoiseach launched the New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity &ndash; that entails expenditure of £194 million over the next three years on all of the major areas of education. Young people at risk of early school leaving and the schools they attend will be prioritised for inclusion in developments under this major programme.</P>
      <P>The importance of school retention as a priority issue is clearly reflected in the national development plan. It is also a priority for the Government and for my Department that the life chances of young people are improved and their prospects of employment and meaningful participation in the various dimensions of social activity are maximised through school retention and certification.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Computer equipment and software are items that may be provided. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. My officials have been in touch with the school authorities and with the mother of the student in question. I understand that the school submitted an application for an equipment grant on Friday of last week. The application once received will be processed by my Department without delay.</P>
