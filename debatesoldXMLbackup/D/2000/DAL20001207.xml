      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with two related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Owen and Wright. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office. I call first on Deputy Owen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgent public importance: the loss of 750 jobs at Motorola, Swords, County Dublin; the circumstances surrounding the job losses; how long the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has known of the impending job losses; and the steps she intends to take to remedy the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of public interest which requires urgent consideration: the announcement yesterday at Motorola, Swords, of the loss of 750 jobs and the urgent need for a special task force to bring further new employment opportunities to the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 23<i>b</i>, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of proposed approval of United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; No. 22, Supplementary Estimates for Public Services [Votes 6,10, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42 and 44] returned from committee; and No. 21<i>a</i>, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [2000] (Motion 4, resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 23<i>b</i> and 22 shall be decided without debate <Col N="1094" /> and in the case of No. 22, the Supplementary Estimates [Votes 6,10, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42 and 44] shall be moved together and decided by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate on No. 21<i>a</i>: the speech of the main spokespersons or a Member nominated in his or her stead for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes; and Members may share time.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 23<i>b</i> and No. 22, Supplementary Estimates, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 21<i>a</i> agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the taking of all the Supplementary Estimates together without debate, perhaps the Tánaiste would obviate the need for a division on this matter. I am informed that Vote 42(<i>e</i>) concerns scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht, the scheme for improving strategic roads in the Gaeltacht. Two Gaeltacht areas have been specifically excluded from this, namely the Meath Gaeltacht&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the Waterford Gaeltacht. No money has been allocated for road improvement schemes in these areas. We will certainly vote against the Supplementary Estimates if these areas are excluded from the schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first proposal was agreed and we are now dealing with the proposal for No. 21<i>a</i>. Is that proposal agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister for Finance omit the Government's planned increases in motor taxes from his Budget Statement? These were announced by means of a press release after the budget. Was the Minister afraid the party atmosphere would be destroyed? Is that why he allowed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to announce these increases by press release?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>They were announced in the middle of the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this something which will never happen, like some of the other announcements made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue relates to the debate on the budget. Deputy Bruton is well aware that motor tax revenue goes directly to local authorities. The Minister for Finance dealt with many <Col N="1095" /> issues in the budget which cannot all be delivered in a speech of a reasonable length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tax increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party called for this last night. That is what it voted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not right.</P>

      <P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste satisfied that a financial resolution is not required for the imposition of an additional charge on the people? Is it not the case that this increase in motor taxation is being decided by the Government and not by local authorities? The Government is accountable to this House and if it wishes to impose an additional charge on the people it is obliged in this democracy, as I understand it, to put that proposition before the House. Why was the proposition of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, not put before the House last night with the financial resolutions and why was it not announced by the Tánaiste's friend, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement? As the Tánaiste is, I believe, sincerely concerned to maintain the standing of this House as the place where important announcements are made and decided, can she excuse or explain the unwillingness of the Minister for Finance to make this announcement in the budget? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is a great person to stand up for standards when in Opposition. There are certain standards regarding the way this House should be treated in the matter of the imposition of taxes on the people. Why did the Minister for Finance not announce this tax measure in the budget yesterday? Why was it kept secret?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a one sentence preamble to a question that the Chair normally allows. It is <Col N="1096" /> important that the full fiscal parameters of the budget are presented to the House. Without exception, that is always done in the Minister's speech. If this is a departure, are there other fiscal measures we will hear of when other Ministers speak in this debate? We must know the full parameters of the budget before Members are asked to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating the financial statement of the Minister for Finance. This measure is not included in that so the debate is starting under a false pretence. Will the Tanáiste give an assurance that no other tax announcements will be made by the Minister for the Envir<Col N="1097" /> onment and Local Government, or any other Minister, that were not included in the budget?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised the resignation of an inspector investigating the Ansbacher issue and the Taoiseach responded. The Tánaiste has direct ministerial responsibility for the matter. Will she indicate the circumstances surrounding the resignation in so far as she knows them, the proposals she has to bring these matters to a conclusion and when the reports will be available for scrutiny by this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 November, Judge Declan Costello came to see me and informed me that, on medical advice, he had to, unfortunately, stand down from the inspectorate. He very much regretted that. I am very grateful to him, as I am sure is the House, for the outstanding work he has done over the past year. He has worked seven days a week on many occasions to try to bring this inquiry to a conclusion. I have been in discussions with the Attorney General for the past two weeks seeking to have an inspector or inspectors appointed to replace Judge Costello. It is important to ensure there is no conflict of interest and that inspectors have not worked for any of the people under investigation. We are now in a position to put names to the High Court and I hope that will be done tomorrow. I stress Judge Costello stood down on medical advice and solely on that.</P>

      <P>Yesterday's budget reminded me vividly of a certain event that took place with a similar fanfare, red smoke, balloons and champagne &ndash; the Eircom launch. At the time all the spin, hype and PR had an air of euphoria about it. There were no losers, everyone was a winner and stood to gain very substantially. As we know, that cream turned very sour for those investors. They face little prospect of getting their money back, leaving aside a windfall. They were battered and bruised by the major shareholders withdrawing, about which they were not told. All the assurances from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste at the time and all the spin and hype were just froth that disappeared into a more sober reality. It is the same with this budget. I acknowledge that it is impossible to give away £4 billion and not have some good news to tell, but this budget gambles with our economic prosperity. It raises the stakes enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some clear warnings the Government needs to take heed of. In economic history there is no case where oil prices have doubled and house prices have more than doubled where there has not been an economic recession. What has cushioned the country from very high inflation and loss of competitiveness has been the drop in the value of the euro. The Government inherited the lowest inflation in Europe, 1.25%, but we now have three times the European average inflation. We now have the highest inflation in 18 years. Having regard to the prospects for inflation, local authorities have been advised by the ESRI to factor in a 7.5% increase into their estimates for the provision of the same public services. I am advised by the CIF that construction inflation to build a similar house, road or school is rising at 15% per annum. Inflation is out of control. All these pressures are building up in the economy leaving aside the wage inflation pressure. What has cushioned the economy has been the drop in the value of the euro, which has allowed us to remain competitive, particularly in our principal market, that of the UK, our nearest neighbour. If the euro appreciates in value by up to 10%, which is not impossible, there is a risk that on the rebound we will be seriously exposed to a cost price squeeze. We will loose our competitiveness, our export markets, jobs and investment. What will the Minister for Finance have done at this critical juncture? Like a power hose of high octane fuel, he will have pumped an expenditure of £4 billion chasing very limited capacity on the embers of an inflation developing economy. The construction industry and the labour market cannot absorb that level of growth. It does not have that level of spare capacity. What happens when too much money is chasing too limited a capacity, is that inflation rises. I greatly fear that when we move to the reality of this budget, the reality of this attempt, for political reasons, to position the Government favourably for an election, it will be similar to the Nigel Law<Col N="1107" /> son era in the 1980s in the UK. Then add to that all the populace reaction to those budgets, where taxes were slashed and people were thrusting forward. What happened? The UK manufacturing industry was decimated as inflation took hold. The UK lost competitiveness and there was negative equity in the housing market when people could not retrieve the equity in their house based on the previous mortgage they had taken out.</P>
    <P>We have all the ingredients in this historic gamble of £4 billion of moving from boom to bust. That is my first serious concern. The analogy with the Eircom launch is entirely valid and the 600,000 people who are left holding share certificates will know what I mean in terms of the ultimate pain they suffer.</P>
    <P>The second area I wish to touch on, which is the most gaping, glaring omission and oversight in the budget, a matter on which I have the unique experience to speak, is the BSE crisis. I was Chairman and President of the European Council of Ministers in the latter half of 1996 when we had the Presidency of the European Council, when the last BSE crisis was at its height. I know what the decisions of the Council of Ministers on 4 December mean. The decision to not feed meat and bonemeal to any pigs and poultry means there is no market in meat and bonemeal. It is now a commodity to be disposed of.</P>
    <P>The second decision to shoot to kill, to destroy or to screen all animals over 30 months has major economic significance. I want to develop this point because the mandarins in the Department of Finance have not got to grips with the reality of it. Not one penny has been provided in the budget to deal with the BSE crisis. This is not only a crisis for farm incomes, it is a crisis for the Exchequer. If the Government is in any doubt about it, members of it should go to the UK Minister for Agriculture in Whitehall, as I did. Europe is going down the track of the destruction system that the UK had to go in response to BSE. That cost it billions of pounds.</P>
    <P>I will tell the Government how the time bomb on which it is sitting will detonate. Very shortly after the bank holiday on 1 January, when these decisions come into effect, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, will get a call from the rendering and meat and bonemeal group and subsequently from meat processors to say, &ldquo;Sorry, there is no point in us rendering meat and bonemeal because we have nowhere to sell it; it is a waste product&rdquo;. We produce 140,000 tonnes of this. They will say, &ldquo;Sorry, we are closing down the rendering plants because there is no one to buy our meat and bonemeal&rdquo;. Very quickly Larry Goodman and all the meat factories will be into the Minister to say, &ldquo;Sorry, we have trolley loads of offal piling up in our meat factories &ndash; as they said to me one Easter Tuesday in 1996 when they said &ndash; we can't slaughter animals anymore because there is nowhere to go with the offal.&rdquo;  They landed into my office to tell <Col N="1108" /> me that the meat processing industry had come to a grinding halt. There is only one group who can buy the meat and bonemeal, that group sits in the Government. It is faced with the same situation as was the UK. It will have to buy the meat and bonemeal, store it and dispose of it. There is no other reality. No one inside or outside Europe will take it off the Government's hands. We have been getting rid of it by way of pig and poultry feed. That decision on that matter is one made by the European Council.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second decision that was made. We have 750,000 animals over 30 months old. The Food Advisory Authority expert, Mr. Wall, has said they should all be destroyed and not consumed. Cow beef will be virtually unsaleable. That means the Government will first have to decide if the animals will be screened. On doing that, the first difficulty that will be encountered is that the incidence of BSE will rise, which will have a knock on effect on our beef markets. The most likely outcome is that the animals will have to be destroyed and rendered. Who will buy those animals? There is no market for them either.</P>
    <P>Our beef industry is our largest indigenous industry, accounting for in excess of 3% of GNP. This is a nightmare for us. We have 1 million tonnes of beef to export, as we consume only 10% of what we produce. We are the largest exporter of beef in the Northern Hemisphere. This is a huge fiscal crisis. The Government will have to buy the meat and bonemeal, arrange for its storage and disposal and deal with 750,000 animals. In the nine month period between the latter half of 1996 and the early part of 1997, between slaughter premium, agreed with the Department of Finance, and top up payments in special beef premium, suckler cow premium and slaughter premium, we negotiated £400 million of compensation when there was a market for meat and bonemeal and for these cows. There will be huge difficulties disposing of that, therefore farm income compensation will be the third level of cost on the Exchequer. I know Franz Fischler has no appetite for picking up these costs. It has already been established that we will have to deal with 10% of the animals over 30 months, or 70% of that cost, and the entire cost of the meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>No contingency provisions whatsoever were made in the budget for that. I can imagine the spin doctors saying: &ldquo;Please, our whole budget arithmetic will be set aside if we have to deal with the reality of this. We could not go ahead with all the good news in our spin doctor programme for tax and social welfare increases and so on.&rdquo;  Therefore they simply ignored the issue and pretended it did not exist. The Minister said it was too early to indicate this but if one goes to Whitehall one can find out exactly what it will cost and the way it will develop. I predict that it will cost the Government several hundred million pounds in the next two years to pick up the tab <Col N="1109" /> for the decisions made by the Council of Ministers in Brussels on 4 December.</P>
    <P>The most serious and undermining aspect of the Government's handling of the economy relates to housing. If one talks to ASTI members, signalmen or members of the other 350 groups going to the LRC to discuss pay problems, they will say: &ldquo;My partner and I are working and we cannot even aspire to buying our own home.&rdquo;  That is the underlying pressure for wage inflation, particularly in the greater Dublin area. The average industrial wage is around £16,000 per annum while the average cost of a new house is in excess of six times that. Lenders will only give three times one's gross income, therefore there is an affordability gap for most people. The NCB report stated that only one fifth of people at work are now in the private housing market. One has to have an income of over £35,000 per year and that has been independently assessed.</P>
    <P>What did the Government do about that housing crisis? The solution was very simple: demand exceeds supply, so we need to increase supply to 60,000 houses per year and we must build 500,000 more houses. That is the only solution to the housing crisis. What did the Government do? Absolutely nothing. During the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill, 1997, Deputy McCreevy, then in Opposition, stated in column 812: &ldquo;If I had an accounting business and a farming business I could offset losses, one against the other. Revenue should look at the farming business from the point of view of a rule of standards.&rdquo; He went on to state that similarly, section 23 relief should be provided and he tabled amendments Nos. 17, 19, 71 and 81 to bring the property owning business into line with other trades and professions to offset one's interest costs against income tax.</P>
    <P>The private rented residential accommodation sector report stated that we need 33,000 new accommodation units every year for students and those with contract jobs who do not wish to settle down in an area. I am now told that because of the Bacon report, and the 9% and 2% per annum provisions, investment in this sector is at a total standstill. Rents are due to increase by a minimum of 20% per annum and there will be a real, unprecedented crisis in the private residential market.</P>
    <P>In addition, capital gains tax and the social housing provisions of Part V of the Planning Act mean that the supply of houses in the last quarter of this year and going into next year will reduce by 20%. At a critical time for supply, Government-inspired decisions will help reduce supply and the situation will become profoundly worse. This is very serious and will have a knock-on effect on industrial disputes, wage inflation and so on.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Planning Act sets out that 20% of a housing development of a certain size must be set aside for social housing. However, no blueprint has been provided to ensure 20% of the land goes to the local authority at an agricultural price, neither is there a workable proposal to <Col N="1110" /> ensure that a local authority gets a certain number of houses free. There is total uncertainty in the construction industry as it cannot determine the price for the remaining 80% of the houses. The construction industry is saying it will not buy a pig in a poke and is backing off. Similarly, capital gains tax is at 20% but if one does not use it this rises to 60% within three years. Landowners are looking for indemnity against that, which results in a lack of supply of land for the market.</P>
    <P>Those three measures, the capital gains tax, the Planning Act and particularly the Bacon measures, will restrict supply. The number of new units per year, instead of going from 46,000 to 50,0000 and on to 60,0000, will go back to approximately 30,000 per year. The underlying growth in the labour market, demographic requirements and reduction in house formation sizes mean these units will be required. Again, one will have too much money chasing too few houses and prices will continue to rise. That, more than anything else, will contribute to pressure in the economy.</P>
    <P>There are other key differences between Fine Gael's policies on taxation, welfare and other issues and the Government's approach. If one gives away £4 billion a lot of Fianna Fáil cows are calving. There must be a lot of popular measures but some key points have been missed. The cut in the top rate of tax and the failure to exempt income within the national minimum wage is a serious error. If one earns the national minimum wage, which has been independently arbitrated at £220 for a 40-hour week, then one's gross and net pay should be the same. The resources were available to allow that in the budget but it has not been done. The stay at home mother receives an increase to £60 per week through the extension of individualisation but the fact that she does not qualify for the PAYE allowance is another serious anomaly. We have argued that the fairest thing to do would be not only to exempt the minimum wage but to introduce a new middle rate of tax between 20% and 40% at 33% because the key problem is not that our top rate of tax is too high but that people on very modest incomes are paying the top rate.</P>
    <P>The biggest benefits in the package favour the better off and skew it in an unfair way. The small print of the PRSI provisions will be very negative for the manufacturing industry, which needs to reverse the brain drain and to get the top people in, particularly in the electronics sector. These are the companies which will pay the higher corporation tax. They go from 10% to 12.5%, so they get none of the benefits the service industry get, yet they will be faced with higher PRSI charges of £130 million with the abolition of the ceiling. In relation to welfare, I cannot understand how any Government could be proud of the fact that free fuel stays at the present level of £5 or £6 per week. The cost of fuel has increased enormously since the 1980s, when that was last adjusted, and this is a very effective cash scheme which provides for the real needs of pensioners during winter. I am disappointed that all that could be done was to extend the scheme by three weeks.</P>
    <P>There is also a clear problem regarding chil<Col N="1111" /> dren under five years when it comes to child benefit. Such children are not in the formal education system and no provision has been made to give a variable rate for infant children or those under five. Resources should be targeted better, as children in primary or secondary school do not need child care. The cost of child care impacts most on those children who are not in formal education in terms of crèches, playschools and so on, yet that is not recognised at all. The Minister gave the impression he is knee-deep in analysis and reports on this matter, yet how he could miss that basic point strikes me as a glaring omission.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reduction of 1% in the top rate of VAT from 21% to 20% as helping e-commerce. There is no vision regarding e-commerce in the budget. It is not beyond the wit of mankind to devise, as President Bill Clinton did, a special VAT rate for e-commerce sales abroad. An imaginative proposal to stimulate sales on the web could have been brought forward but that will not be possible in terms of the alteration of the top rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>The Government has missed a major opportunity to bring forward novel schemes to promote savings. I have spoken about the personal spending boom. All these lessons have been learned before. In the late 1970s, what happened with the huge release of money from that manifesto into the economy? There were more imports of cars, televisions and brown goods, all of which had to be paid for later.</P>
    <P>Savings must be encouraged. We proposed that the first £5,000 of income from DIRT would be exempt to encourage people to save because there is such a low rate of return and there are many products that the insurance industry has put forward in terms of life assurance and the taxation of the exit of money from assurance and insurance investment schemes at 25%. Halving that to 12.5% was a particular budget submission. I have advocated that the NTMA should introduce an infrastructure bond of, say, five or ten years' duration. That would be very attractive and, like post office savings, tax free. These are all novel measures in savings, yet all we have is something that should have been done three years ago in relation to the credit unions. I am glad the Minister has eaten humble pie in that regard because his arrogance was completely out of line in relation to the excellent work done by that community based, non-profit movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extremely vague in the area of charities. The section restricting donations to domestic charities needs to be completely revamped, with a minimum of £200. Voluntarism is the backbone of many activities in this country and I regret that the Minister has just made some nebulous reference to the Finance Bill and that he does not have any definite proposals at this stage.</P>
    <P>There is a big hype about medical cards being extended to those over 70 but for those under 70, it is not so great. Many people do not reach that age; I think three score years and ten was the biblical provision. That is where Fianna Fáil clocks in for medical cards. The percentage of the popu<Col N="1112" /> lation with medical cards, and it varies from one health board area to another, has gone from just below 50% to about 30%. The number of medical card holders has greatly reduced. We propose that people under 18 in full-time education and people over 65 should get a medical card, and that will be our position in the election, but many other people could be considered. What about families where the wife has a part-time job and perhaps they have a little extra coming in because of overtime. They will lose their medical card because they are earning over £135 a week. Every week people come to my clinics to complain about that. A basic provision for a family of £200 of an income limit would be more meaningful than waiting till the person is 70. I regret the Government has not taken a more radical approach in relation to medical cards.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed in relation to the green agenda, my own area of responsibility in terms of the environment portfolio. There is no budget for recycling. There is a waste crisis looming in this country and 29 landfill sites are almost full. The Government does not have any coherent strategy other than blaming local authorities. Someone needs to drive waste management through a new authority, and set up the critical mass and the necessary measures for recycling. Plastic recycling facilities are a joke. Recycling facilities for cans, both steel and aluminium, do not work. Glass is the only facility that works. We have no tyre recycling facilities and in a whole series of areas we are the worst in Europe. A serious administrative and fiscal effort needs to be made to deal with recycling. Everyone agrees that 50% of our waste, two million tonnes a year, should be recycled but there is no infrastructure on the ground to deal with that. Also in that regard, I regret that there is nothing much for the green energy sector in terms of wind energy.</P>
    <P>This budget has three extremely serious flaws. First, it is a recipe for boom to bust. Second, it ignores the reality of the cost on the Exchequer of the BSE crisis and, third, it fails to address the house supply impediments that this Government has put in place. When the froth wears off, these realities will emerge to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to highlight a point Deputy Yates mentioned, the £4.5 billion which is being thrown into the economy. That is pouring petrol rather than water on the inflation fire and the knock-on bottlenecks such as the infrastructural deficits Deputy Yates highlighted. The Minister did not take the opportunity yesterday to focus on the issues of inflation and congestion, which are opposite sides of the same coin. Regardless of the amount of money thrown at certain elements of the system, it will not change the current position. The spend on the health sector has increased by 75%, yet people are spending longer periods on the waiting lists for treatment than before. There have been a number of instances of people dying while on the waiting lists. In my own area, the Western Health Board called a person on the waiting list for surgery who had died two years previously. That is the system the Minister for Finance is currently standing <Col N="1113" /> over, yet he is not prepared to tackle the bottlenecks in the system. There is a need to radically change the whole structure of our health service and other services if we are to get the benefit from the spend about which the Minister has spoken. Without that structural reform, the budget will not have the impact for which the Minister is hoping.</P>
      <P>A sound economy is crucial to achieving a better quality of life. Such a vision cannot be built on policies which undermine our long-term competitiveness. Loose spending policies and heavy-handed bureaucracies have no place in a strategy to rebuild the quality of our public services. Our economic growth remains vulnerable. The threats are real. We need to consolidate our prosperity. Already the strains are evident. We are running into serious capacity problems. This is especially evident in the construction and housing sectors. It is also evident in the skills and labour shortages in the transport sector. The consequences are increasing pressure on wages and prices, and rapidly escalating congestion costs. Competitiveness would be quickly lost if everyone pushes for their own claim for a bigger share in the free for all. We must preserve and deepen the social partnership we have built. In a more open global marketplace, competitiveness is of fundamental importance. We must protect and carefully build on our competitive strengths. Public and private monopolies should be broken up and the State must confine itself to dealing with the regulatory issues necessary to protect the weak and maintain competitive conditions.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister spoke about reducing VAT to alleviate the effects of inflation on the consumer price index, and the Tánaiste also referred to that in the House last night, but unless the reductions in VAT are passed on to the consumer, they will not have the desired impact. The only way to ensure that is done is to have a strong Competition Authority but, unfortunately, the Government has squeezed the Competition Authority into a position where it is completely ineffective. The Tánaiste has provided funding for additional staff but without reform of the structure, that funding will not succeed in getting additional staff. The authority is finding it extremely difficult to recruit and retain staff, especially experienced staff such as solicitors, because of the uncompetitive pay structure and poor prospects for salary increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Authority is recruiting junior solicitors who are not experienced to deal with the level of resistance with which the authority has to deal in terms of anti-competitive practices and passing on the benefit of the decrease in VAT to consumers. Senior solicitors working in the private sector are paid the same salary as the Director of the Competition Authority and there is little chance of recruiting them into the authority. The Tánaiste has stated on numerous occasions that she intends to fully resource the Competition Authority. However, her inaction in solving the staffing difficulties has not only seriously compromised the effectiveness of the authority and the public perception of it, but it has also given a bad impression to potential <Col N="1114" /> employees. There is little point in talking about the elimination of bottlenecks or the need to improve competitiveness if the authority is not given the necessary resources. Fine Gael has proposed the establishment of a task force to look at the bottlenecks which are jeopardising our competitiveness and putting pressure on inflation and to put forward recommendations which can be swiftly passed by this House.</P>
    <P>We should examine areas where the rates of price increase are above the norm and make them a priority so that the pressures are removed. Deputy Yates referred to housing, which is a good example. The 9% rate of stamp duty introduced earlier this year has put huge pressure on the private rented sector and is a contradiction to the proposals put forward by the commission on the private rented sector. Two years ago the Minister introduced the rural renewal scheme, the urban renewal scheme and the town renewal scheme. The 9% rate of stamp duty obliterates the incentives under these schemes. The objective of the schemes was to encourage investment in dilapidated areas of towns and rural areas which have been devoid of investment for generations and to revitalise them. The Minister has completely blocked such investment by the introduction of the 9% rate of stamp duty on second homes.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of this is that people are coming under increasing pressure in trying to find rented accommodation. I know a number of third level students who only managed to secure rented accommodation in Dublin last week. The Minister has continued to ignore this problem and did not avail of the opportunity to address it in the budget. He has ignored both the private rented sector and students who have to pay astronomical money for accommodation if they are lucky enough to get it. Many landlords are not prepared to rent to students and the rate of grant is not adequate to cover the cost of accommodation.</P>
    <P>There has been a decrease in the number of students taking up science and technology courses in third level institutions. This comes back to the point made by Deputy Noonan yesterday that many Departments have returned money at the end of the year because they have not been able to spend it. The Tánaiste's Department returned funding allocated for investment in the science and technology area and ensuring we have an enterprise culture which will help indigenous industries to grow and expand in the same way as some of the major players in the IT sector. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, who is a former Minister with responsibility for science and technology should realise the importance of investment in this area. Unfortunately, the necessary structures have not been put in place and the funding for this area has been returned to the Exchequer. The Minister for Finance has allocated the handsome sum of £0.25 million for the promotion of enterprise education at second level. However, not one penny was allocated for the promotion of science and technology. We can talk about enterprise all we like, but unless the basic fundamentals are in place in <Col N="1115" /> the economy and people can take up the skilled jobs we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue close to my heart, that is, school transport. I raise this issue because the Minister's proposals in this area are along the lines of the recommendations made to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, 12 months ago in the Oireachtas Joint Committee report on school transport. Sadly, the Minister has failed to address the issue of dilapidated buses. It is not acceptable that children should have rain falling on top of their heads while travelling in school buses. The Minister did not avail of the opportunity in the budget to fund a rural transport initiative, as proposed in the report. He did not address the issues of bus safety, the provision of first aid kits and mobile phones on buses so that contact can be made with depots when they break down, over-crowding or the problem where children are abandoned outside schools at 8 a.m. and have to wait in the rain until the school opens at 9 a.m. The Minister had an opportunity to address these issues with the money available to him.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the Government is not meeting the targets for infrastructure set out in the national development plan because of bureaucratic inertia and the turf wars between various Departments. Unless these bottlenecks are tackled and resolved the Government will not be able to deal with the infrastructural deficit. The Minister for Finance referred to reform of the CPO. However, the measures announced by him, which will have no net cost to the Exchequer, will not resolve the problems in relation to motorways, gas pipelines or fibre optic cable. These problems could be swiftly resolved if some imagination was applied to the projects. Instead of putting large integrated projects out to tender, the Government is breaking up the work into smaller pieces, thereby slowing down the process as each project has to go through a separate planning and tendering process. For example, the Dublin-Cork motorway will be built in six segments. It could easily be built in one segment and allotted to a single contractor at a competitive price. It is a matter of reforming the bureaucratic nightmare that exists to resolve some of these issues, provide competition in the marketplace and ensure we meet our targets, which need to be delivered on in terms of infrastructure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Presentation nowadays is considered more important than reality when it comes to the annual budget. In every budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, we are told how immensely better off we will be but for most people it does not quite turn out like that. Every year we are told that so many wage earners have been removed from the tax net, a figure that hardly survives longer than the day on which it is announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, using the Minister's figure, he forecast on a post-budget basis that tax revenue for 2000 would amount to £20.15 billion. He told us yesterday the outturn will be £21.49 billion. That is an error of 7.5%. In other words, the <Col N="1116" /> Government took £1.34 billion more in taxes from people than even the Minister for Finance had planned in the current year. Yesterday he told us that on a pre-budget basis he expected tax revenues for 2001 to amount to £24.5 billion but that post-budget revenues would amount to £23.99 billion. In other words, after yesterday's measures introduced in the budget the forecast outturn will be £23.99 billion.</P>
    <P>The first fact to be highlighted from these figures is that despite the hoop-la surrounding his tax cutting budget the Government next year plans to take £2.49 billion more in tax revenues than in 2000. The second thing that can be stated with confidence is that the Minister and the Department have again underestimated the resources available to the Minister for the coming year. One could see some merit in times of scarcity in the Department of Finance continually coming into this House and seriously, not marginally, underestimating tax revenue outturn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte, I ask you to refer to the Minister for Finance, not the Department of Finance or its officials. The Minister is responsible in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>You normally spend your time in that Chair, a Leas Cheann-Comhairle, asking me not to say things about the Minister. I will be very glad to comply with your stricture.</P>
      <P>However, successive Ministers for Finance, since economic growth took off, have come into the House and made predictions which they must have made on the basis of advice from the model operating in the Department of Finance. The consistent under estimation of key economic indicators and outturns for the year to that extent by the Minister and the Department ought to be reviewed because I cannot see what purpose it serves nowadays. It served a purpose when times were bad in so much as it acted as a brake against Ministers for Finance and Governments taking measures they would have liked in terms of spending and so on, but when there is a Minister in office who, despite his image, has no regard for spending, I cannot see what the merit is in consistently under estimating the outturn.</P>
      <P>The total tax take planned by the Government for next year is to increase. I acknowledge that yesterday those who have over the decades paid their taxes, DIRT and eschewed offshore banking got something back but it could and should have in certain areas been greater and it could and should have been better balanced and more equitably and fairly distributed.</P>
      <P>I refer again to the Minister's figures in his Budget Statement to illustrate why the budget is not what it appears. The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compared with last year a single worker on the estimated average industrial wage had £1,602 more in his or her pocket in a full year due to wage increases and tax reductions in my last budget. This overall increase represents a 13% increase for that worker's disposable earnings on last year. After today's budget this worker next year will not only receive a further 5.5% from the second phase of the PPF and <Col N="1117" /> an additional 2% as a result of the adjustments agreed on 4 December but will also benefit from tax reductions in this budget to give a total increase in disposable income next year of 13.5%.</P>
    <P>That is a quite remarkable and succinct summary, which demonstrates that the worker on average wages, who most certainly did not feel he did well this year, will increase his disposable income next year by 0.5% &ndash; 13.5% in 2001 compared to 13% in 2000. The Minister's figures give a lie to the impression that the average worker will receive a huge benefit from the budget. Everyone acknowledges that last year's budget was skewed in favour of high earners, yet in this budget the person on average wages will improve his or her disposable income by 0.5% as compared to this year.</P>
    <P>What the Minister's presentation unintentionally achieves is to highlight the extent of low pay in the land of the Celtic tiger. For example, take the Minister's claim that we now have a tax code which exempts 667,775 wage earners. What kind of an economy exempts this number of workers from tax when the exemption threshold is £144 per week or less than £7,500 per annum? Accepting that not all of these are single workers, a total of 667,775 out of 1.7 million workers shows that we have a huge low pay problem. In a country where the price of a modest home has doubled in four years the person on average earnings has no prospect of affording his or her own home.</P>
    <P>A person earning close to the average industrial wage, say £16,000 per annum, will gain £620 from the budget while a person on £60,000 will gain £2,165 or a person on £100,000 will gain a little short of £3,000. This is perfectly consistent with the Minister's previous three budgets. If the cumulative benefit of his four budgets is analysed in terms of tax changes, it amounts to a gain of £1,138 for the person on the average industrial wage. However, the same effect over four budgets for a person on £34,000 is £4,862 and it is £6,422 for someone on £60,000.</P>
    <P>If one examines a comparison between single and married persons over those four budgets in five different earning categories the figures are interesting in terms of the totals. A single person on £9,100 gains a cumulative £1,138, as I said, whereas a married couple receives £459. At £17,000 the figures are £3,842 compared with £2,192 for a married couple. At £34,000, the figures are £4,862 compared with £7,684. At £60,000, the cumulative benefit is £6,422 or, for a married couple, £9,244. At £100,000 the figures are £8,822 and, for a married couple, £11,644. In other words, the single person on £9,100 receives £1,138 and the person on £100,000 receives £8,822. If he or she is married and is on £9,100, the figure is £459 and £11,644 if he or she is on £100,000. There is no equity in that type of tax reform driven mainly by the Minister and her party, although she and the Minister for Finance are political Siamese twins and there probably was not much of a struggle in seeing eye to eye on it.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, if he lets nature take its course, the Government might stagger on until next summer.</P>
      <P>The tables of the Minister for Finance show that a single person on PAYE and earning no more than £9,000 a year will still pay tax. The Minister spent £371 million in reducing tax rates when that money could have been targeted at increasing the exemption threshold, thus benefiting all taxpayers but especially those on very low pay.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued that a Minister for Finance would wheel out his surrogates to accuse, misleadingly, my colleague, Deputy McDowell, of being prepared to raid the pension fund. All the advisers recruited in Áras de Valera devise colourful sound bites. They do not read the policies published by other parties but they have sound bites on the word processor. All they need do is push a button and out they come. While they accused my colleague of being prepared to raid the pension fund, the same Minister in this budget has not hesitated from not only raiding the pension fund but also cutting the PRSI rates. We do not see any humbug in the two positions taken by the same Government.</P>
      <P>Some employer bodies complained this morning about the abolition of the PRSI income ceiling but made no mention of the cutting of the contribution rate from 5% to 3% for self-employed and proprietary directors. The corporate sector has generally done well. I am not sure why it is no longer headlined because it used to be but one must now read the accompanying documents to discover that the cost to the Exchequer of the cut in corporation tax on the way to realising the single rate of 12.5% is £194 million. I thought that would have been headlined in the traditional fashion.</P>
      <P>Small businesses receive further relief through the announced change in the definition of a small firm by the raising of the income limit from £50,000 a year to £200,000 a year, which is worth another £20 million. In addition, changes to the operation of capital allowances will cost the Exchequer and benefit business to the tune of £140 million in the next few years. The changes in respect of company cars will cost the Exchequer another £10 million over the next three years. I heard Turlough O'Sullivan saying on television last night that, from the chat he had with the Minister, she was prepared to re-examine the PRSI ceiling.</P>

      <P>I would like her to take the opportunity in addressing the House to say if she has given that commitment to IBEC. We already had the announcement last night about vehicle registration tax and it is important we should <Col N="1119" /> know the full extent of what is included in the budget.</P>
      <P>When compared to this largesse, most social welfare recipients have less to exult about. The £8 per week basic increase is mean-spirited at a time of unimaginable riches. It brings the unemployment or disability benefit rate to £85. The provision for carers is indecent in a bountiful economy when only 5,000 extra will qualify for the modest allowance out of an estimated population of 120,000 carers. If the Minister was not going to take up the Labour Party proposal to use the £173 million windfall from the DIRT inquiry for the benefit of pensioners, then surely he could have ring-fenced it for the benefit of hard-pressed carers. The changes for medical card entitlements are minimalist and the Minister and Government have run away from the child care issue.</P>
      <P>In an economy working almost at full employment, it is scarcely surprising that child care was a principal debate running up to this budget. In a society where ownership of a reasonable home is predicated on two persons going out to work, it is scarcely surprising that the grossly inadequate and hugely expensive child care issue should have been a main debate. Against a background where Fianna Fáil in 1997 promised that home-based carers would be given a tax free allowance and that working parents would receive an equivalent amount of tax relief, it is scarcely surprising now that there is such a feeling of let-down after a budget that avoided the issue and ran away from child care.</P>
      <P>There is no point seeking to confuse child benefit, an instrument of social policy, with child care, a support to employment policy. I note that Barnardo's drew attention to the fact that Ireland has one of the highest levels of child poverty in Europe. Yesterday's improvements in child benefit are very welcome in the assault on child poverty. However, this ought not be confused with the child care issue.</P>
      <P>With the school teachers at the gates of Leinster House, primarily because two teachers can no longer secure a mortgage for a reasonable home, the Minister's response to the housing crisis is the introduction of a rent a room scheme. If one cannot afford a home, take in a lodger. This is almost the first indication we have had in the lifetime of this Government of a rift between the Torvill and Dean of the Government. The Minister is determined to drive the women of Ireland back into the workforce, but the Minister for Finance wants to turn them into landladies. It is back to the 1940s and 1950s as a new version of the glimmerman will inspect who is sleeping in the attic in what the Minister for Finance says are the many homes where the possibility exists of spare accommodation being rented out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has long boasted he is a man of the world. Does he really think people driven to taking in lodgers to pay the mortgage will be over the moon to learn that rental income up to £6,000 per annum will, in future, be exempt from tax? Does the Minister for Finance, above all politicians in this House, believe that unfortunate people trying to repay a mortgage are not already <Col N="1120" /> doing precisely that? Who is eligible to benefit from this creative attack on house prices? Do the landladies in Maynooth qualify for this £6,000 allowance? It shows the facility with which Fianna Fáil can push the buttons in terms of who they should support because, in terms of making&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;in terms of assisting with the housing crisis, but it is certainly a novel approach if the Minister thinks we would take it seriously. The Minister believes that some new capacity will be freed up in this measure, but he does not appear to know what is happening on the ground. This is the same Minister who, for example, demonstrating his knowledge of the black economy, told the RTE reporter George Lee, when the scandal about tax evasion in the banks broke: &ldquo;The sums uncovered are very small in the context of the level of tax paid each year, so I think we need to put it in context&rdquo;. If the sums are small in the banks that were involved in tax evasion, they are very small in terms of the unfortunate young couple who have to open their home unwillingly to a lodger in order to be able to pay the mortgage. The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>It is an insult to the vast majority of taxpayers to say that tax evasion was widespread. The question of tax evasion is not a unique Irish problem, nor is the question of residents having offshore bank accounts for tax evasion a unique Irish thing, as well. So, these things should be borne in mind rather than people going off half cocked and making ridiculous and outlandish allegations, both against the Revenue Commissioners and against other people as well.</P>
      <P>That is the hard-bitten Minister for Finance who knows what is going on on the ground. That is his assessment of what is happening when it comes to multi-million pound tax evasion facilitated by the financial institutions, yet this is the measure that he thinks will make a contribution towards freeing up capacity to deal with the extent of the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation has again soared and Ireland is once again a high inflation member of the European Union. In 1999 the headline rate of inflation was just 1.6%. In his budget speech a year ago, the Minister forecast an inflation rate of 3% for the year 2000. This year, however, inflation will actually average 5.5% according to the Minister. This is likely to be another miscalculation. The average for this year understates the true picture in <Col N="1121" /> that it does not convey that inflation has continued to rise through the year and is currently at around 7%. A year ago the Minister was of the view that inflation would rise during the early part of this year but would then fall back. It has not. It has continued to accelerate through the year, so this was yet another serious miscalculation. The Government has actually managed to blow away the low inflation economy that it inherited. We now have an inflation rate seriously in excess of the EU average and also seriously in excess of the average in the euro zone. The Minister's response yesterday was to engage in a sleight of hand, juggling the consumer price index figures for next year by cutting VAT and excise on fuel, but will it work? There are no measures in the budget to ensure that the cut in VAT will be passed back to the citizens.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority is under resourced and understaffed. Rather than giving resources to the authority to police the new regime, the Minister simply said that if the cut in VAT was not passed back by business then that would be the end of VAT reductions. So much for attacking inflation. This is reminiscent of the phoney attempt to arrest excessive price taking by publicans. It did not work, but then one would only be disappointed if one was naive enough to believe that it was intended to work. Fianna Fáil will not take on the publicans. Does anyone seriously believe that the price of a pint will be reduced by 2p? Does anybody seriously believe that will be the outcome of the budget, given the manner in which the Director of Consumer Affairs has been obstructed, and given the flaws in the order made by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt? The Minister for Finance has actually facilitated a further 2p profit taking on the pint and the price of drink generally by publicans. The much hyped anti-inflation package does not amount to a hill of beans, and that is without going into the environmental arguments that have been raised about excise duties by other Deputies in last night's debate on the financial resolutions.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was never serious about tackling the issue of the publicans who contribute a disproportionate 0.9% to the consumer price index. Instead of causing the publicans to row back on the increases, the Minister made a flawed order which is being flouted and cannot be policed by the Director of Consumer Affairs. It will happen thus as a result of the budget measures which contain nothing to facilitate an attack on inflation.</P>
    <P>On 8 October, the Taoiseach &ndash; bringing both sides of the road with him &ndash; told Seán Duignan:</P>
    <P>The highest earners in our society should not have a difficulty with paying 44%. I don't think that's the argument; it is that people on relatively low levels of pay still drift into that higher tax rate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, of course, was only reiterating the fair-minded consensus that this year's tax reductions ought to be targeted at the lower to middle income category. IBEC has been strong <Col N="1122" /> in supporting Congress on the same issue, but whatever the Tánaiste wants, she gets. After her <i>annus horribilis</i>, the Progressive Democrats had to be given their way in reducing tax rates rather than spending the £371 million on genuine reform of the tax code that would benefit all, but more especially the low to middle income earners. It probably was not such a struggle inasmuch as the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are political Siamese twins. Having decided not to separate them, the Taoiseach decided to capitulate to them. Out the window went his fine words about targeting ordinary workers as, once again, the biggest gains accrue to the largest earners. The people who in bad times paid punitive taxes to keep our social services functioning, and who did not rush offshore with their money or take refuge in the nearest bogus non-resident account, get less than they deserve from yesterday's budget. At the same time, those who acquired tax exile status, real or imagined, will gain most, but then nobody ever accused this Government combination of being fair.</P>
    <P>I agree that yesterday people got some of their own money back. The Government &ndash; which, in the words of the Tánaiste, is awash with money &ndash; could do no less. The Government could have done more, however, for the 200,000 in persistent poverty. People who fell out of the workforce because of accident, disability or ill health, and who paid punitively high taxes when they were at work, will now receive an extra £8 in disability benefit bringing the weekly rate to £85. The housing crisis threatens to undermine the economic boom. Some 46,000 people are on local authority waiting lists, and 60,000 people are on waiting lists for all forms of housing option. People are sleeping in doorways in our cities. Some 1,200 children are in bed and breakfast care in this city alone. What does this budget offer to redress the housing crisis? Rent a room and take in a lodger, is the response of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, for example, supported the belated initiative on homelessness eventually extracted from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, but even he acknowledges that, like everything else he has done, the initiative will take time. I do not know whether he intends to have the homeless sleeping in taxis over Christmas, but he must acknowledge that emergency measures are urgently required to end the scandal of homelessness in a country, in the words of the Tánaiste, awash with money.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is aware that, as she continues on her continental mission from South Africa, Beijing to Newfoundland, the cost of housing in the economy is a real barrier to people coming here to work and provide the skills which she says are necessary. There is nothing in the budget which deals with the housing crisis. In so far as policy has been devolved to Mr. Bacon, he has only made matters worse and created an imminent crisis in the private rented sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The fundamental issue which had to be faced in compensating social welfare recipients was the role of inflation in this calendar year. The forecast of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, last year of a figure of 3% has turned out to be catastrophically wrong. The figure has ended up at almost 7%. Increases in social welfare, which were paid from April, were, therefore, almost eroded before social recipients received them. The increases averaged 5.2% to 5.5%. The miserable increase of £4 per week for those in receipt of long-term assistance payments was almost wiped out before they received the money in their pockets. In mid to late summer as the price of fuel, heating, transport, groceries and many other items began to escalate and explode any doubts which remained about the social welfare increases provided for in budget 2000 were totally wiped away.</P>
    <P>When I raised the alarm in September at the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, I strongly urged the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to bring forward the payment date of the 2001 increases to January, but he steadfastly refused to do so. He engaged in childish and ridiculous PR hype in recent weeks when he announced that he had been stalled and prevented by the Tánaiste and other Ministers from granting an additional £74 million by way of a double payment in 2000. I asked him why he had not resigned as a result, given that he accepted that there was a real problem because of escalating inflation due to the increase in the price of fuel and problems with the euro, and that he had asked for more money, but failed to get it. The bottom line on budget 2000 is that there was no increase across a range of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance estimates that the rate of inflation in 2001 will be 4.5%, but after his hopeless prediction and that of his advisers last year, can we really believe him? Can we really accept &ndash; this time next year we will be within weeks of having the new euro notes in our pockets &ndash; that there will not be shocks and a hard landing in the economy with the result that, like this year, social welfare increases will be significantly eroded? On the Minister's figures, net current spending will rise by 6.6%. This alone suggests that the rate of inflation will be higher than 4.5%. Does the Minister really care? Paying social welfare increases from April will leave a neat run-in for both him and the Taoiseach to a June general election.</P>
    <P>Given the rate of inflation projected for next year, the increase of £8 per week across a range of social welfare assistance and benefit payments is pathetic. It will bring the personal rate of unemployment assistance, disability allowance and pre-retirement allowance up to £85.50 and carer's allowance, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension and blind person's allowance to £88.50. Even insurance pensions such as invalidity pension will only rise to £89.10. All through the year, each time the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs met the voluntary pillars of social partnership &ndash; the <Col N="1124" /> INOU, Combat Poverty Agency, St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and Women's Network &ndash; he received steady advice that if he wanted to make up for the ravages of inflation on social welfare recipients, who account for one third of the population, he would have to provide for an increase of £14 or, at the very minimum, £10. Sadly, neither he nor the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste listened. They were not even prepared to grant what everybody accepted should be the minimum increase to try to keep social welfare recipients ahead of inflation. The basic increase for 2001 is, therefore, woefully disappointing.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party urged that the applicable figure in respect of qualified adult allowance be increased to 70%. This would mean, for example, that the payment in respect of a dependant of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance would rise to between £58 and £60. The reality is that the Minister for Finance has only granted an increase of £7.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleagues that the Tánaiste and the Minister are the driving force behind the Government on fiscal policy. Social welfare spending has fallen year after year from 11.5% of GDP when the Government took office to around 7% this year. The proportion of GDP for which social welfare recipients account has, therefore, fallen dramatically in what is now a 100 billion euro economy. It can clearly be seen where the real priorities of the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Government lie.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has trumpeted the increases for pensioners, but despite all the hype the non-contributory pension has still not reached £100 per week. It currently stands at £95.50 per week. It took four budgets to increase the contributory pension to £106. Because of the scandal of widescale tax evasion, including DIRT, during the past 30 years the Labour Party demanded that contributory and other types of pensions be increased by at least £24 per week, to increase the basic rate to £120 per week, well over 34% of average industrial earnings. We are still a long way from that benchmark.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what happens in coming months and the timing of the next general election, the Labour Party will guarantee that under any Government in which it participates all pensioners and all those in receipt of long-term social welfare payments will receive an increase of £24 per week backdated to 1 January 2001. My party's spokesperson on finance has carefully costed this proposal. This is only proper and the right of the poorest segment of our community. The Government, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in particular, has failed social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's target of an increase of £24 per week is based on the premise that for 30 to 40 years there has been massive tax evasion, including DIRT. The next general election &ndash; as will be seen from its posters &ndash; will mark pay back time for social welfare recipients, the poorest segment of our community, whom the Government has callously and wilfully disregarded over the past three and a half years, who <Col N="1125" /> now account for 7% of GDP and whose basic needs &ndash; from carers to pensioners to child care &ndash; have not been met. The Labour Party will demand that the extra £628 million which it has promised be paid by any Government in which it participates.</P>

      <P>We have now introduced our fourth budget and there is one to go. In 1997 this Government set out to deliver five reforming budgets. We have delivered four of them and we are on course to deliver the fifth in ten months' time.</P>
      <P>We set out to increase employment and reduce unemployment, to promote social inclusion and prevent social exclusion and to create economic prosperity and use the fruits of that prosperity to help those who most need a helping hand. We made great progress towards these objectives in our first three budgets and we are making further progress in budget 2001.</P>
      <P>I will begin by discussing personal taxation. The last four budgets have seen dramatic progress in the area of personal tax reform. Rates have been cut, bands have been widened and allowances have been raised. The PRSI burden has been reduced. More than 77% of earners have now been removed from the top rate tax net and some 38% of workers have been taken out of the tax net. Almost four out of every ten workers will not pay tax as a result of our four budgets. This is real tax reform by any standards.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have introduced tax credits, the most significant and far reaching reform of our personal tax system in a generation. With this year's budget the transition to tax credits, first signalled two years ago, is now complete. We have not finished yet. This Government will deliver its fifth budget next October and it will be well worth waiting for. The next budget will take all those on the national minimum wage out of the tax net altogether. This is the Government that introduced the national minimum wage. It was not the Labour Party or Democratic Left.</P>

      <P>The rate of progress has been spectacular over the past three and a half years. It compares more than favourably with that of the previous Administration.

      <P>One point was taken off the tax rates. A total of 26 points were taken off the tax rates since 1990 and it was a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government that removed 25 of the 26 points. That speaks volumes for our commitment to tax reform.</P>

      <P>The rainbow coalition achieved virtually nothing on the taxation front. When this Government came to power in 1997 it inherited a tax system that had been left almost unchanged over the previous three budgets, a regime which bore down heavily on people on modest and middle incomes.</P>
      <P>Consider the situation as it was in 1997. A single person entered the tax net at just £77 per week. I am pleased this Government was able to raise this figure to £144 per week and that we will be able to increase it more in next October's budget. In 1997 a single person still hit the top rate of tax at an annual income of just £13,600, little more than £260 per week. Again, I am pleased that this Government has been able to widen the band and raise that figure to £20,000 a year. Further band widening in our next budget will push that figure higher again and ensure that the vast majority of people on middle incomes no longer have to pay tax at the top rate.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the basic rate of income tax was still pitched at a punitive 26%. In four budgets this Administration has been able to get that rate down to 20% in line with the commitments set out in the joint programme for Government. The two main Opposition parties now preach about raising allowances and broadening bands. Why did they not practice what they now preach when they were in Government? The rainbow Government increased the value of the basic tax and PAYE allowance by just 17% in three budgets; we have doubled it in four. It raised the value of the standard rate band for a single person by less than 20% over three budgets; we have increased it by almost 50% in four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is committed to cutting tax <Col N="1127" /> rates but it has also done more to increase bands and allowances than any Administration in the history of the State. The tax debate is not between those who favour raising bands and allowances on the one hand and those who favour reducing rates on the other. A look at the figures shows that this is not the case. The real debate is between the progressive forces in the current coalition which seeks to promote tax reform and the conservative forces in the previous coalition which sought to prevent it. If raising bands and allowances is the game of the Opposition parties, we have taken them on at their own game and beaten them handsomely.</P>
    <P>Much of the budgetary debate in recent years has centred on the top rate of income tax. The position of the Government parties on this issue is clearly set out in the joint programme for Government and we have consistently delivered on that commitment in the programme. We believe that low marginal tax rates are an important economic incentive. Low marginal rates contribute to the competitiveness of the Irish economy and in the long run they generate more revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The position of other parties is not so clear. This year the Labour Party argued strongly that the top rate of tax should remain fixed at 44%. Last year it argued that it should remain fixed at 46%. Three years ago it argued that it should remain fixed at 48%. Just for good measure, in 1998 the party argued in favour of reducing the top rate of tax to 42%. Given its confusion on the subject, it is probably understandable that the Labour Party left the top rate unchanged when it was in Government.</P>
    <P>One of the key contributors to Irish economic success has been our low rate of corporation tax. The IDA has been able to use the 10% rate, and now the 12.5% rate, as a magnet to attract mobile investment into this country. That policy has been spectacularly successful by any standards. We currently win about 27% of all mobile investment coming from the United States into Europe even though we have less than 1% of the European population. We win more than 40% of the investment in the software sector. Ireland can be proud that it is one of the world's largest exporters of software, an achievement that would not have been reached without low corporate taxes among other things.</P>

      <P>We have used low tax rates to attract companies to this country. It is now time to use low tax rates to attract people here.</P>
      <P>If we want Ireland to develop as a high skill, high income economy, the way we have to go is obvious. We will have to focus more on modern high tech industries in sectors such as information technology, telecommunications, international financial services and bio-technology. If we wish to keep Irish people with the requisite skills at home, to get former emigrants to return and new people to come and work in this country, it is vital that we offer them an attractive personal tax regime.</P>
      <P>The Social Democrat led Government in Germany is now committed to substantial reductions in tax rates for higher earners to stimulate the country's economy and improve its competitive position. It knows that the policy makes sense. The question for Labour and the other left-leaning parties in this House is clear. This Government has cut the top rate of tax from 48% to 42% since 1997. Would they reverse those cuts if returned to Government after the next election? I would like to hear the parties opposite tell me that because the voters would be very interested to hear it.</P>

      <P>Judge this Government by any yardstick one chooses and our record on tax reform stands up well. Look at the average tax rates, a measure sometimes favoured by those on the opposite side of the House. By pressing ahead with tax reform on all fronts &ndash; bands, allowances and rates &ndash; we have reduced average tax rates right across the board.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Government a single person on £10,000 a year faced an average tax rate of 19%. We have reduced that to 5%. Under the previous Government too, a single person on £20,000 a year faced an average tax rate of 34%. We have reduced that to 17%. A single income married couple on £30,000 a year faced an average tax rate of 28%. We have now reduced that to 14%. This is clear evidence of the fairness of our tax policies. We have delivered the biggest reductions in average tax rates to those on low incomes. That is the kind of record of achievement of which any Government can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our PRSI system is incredibly complex. There are no fewer than 12 different contribution classes and 35 sub-classes. The system is full of ceilings, floors, allowances and exemptions and this complexity adds to administrative costs throughout the economy. The present system is <Col N="1129" /> riddled with anomalies and inconsistencies. Average PRSI rates, for instance, are lower for people on high incomes than for those on modest incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reforming our system of PRSI and levies. That reform will take place in a way which ensures that the marginal rates are reduced for all earners and that the burden of tax and PRSI on individual workers is reduced. We want to see a regime that is simple and clear, fair and transparent. We have made a start on the process of reform in this year's budget, which will be further advanced in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>This Government strongly believes in the incentive power of low taxation in the business sector. The standard rate of corporation tax has now been reduced by 16 points since the Government took office and we are on course to have the new 12.5% rate in place by 2003. In addition, this year's budget contains very generous measures to reduce the burden of corporation tax on the small business sector. The low-rate band is being broadened substantially, a move which will be of direct benefit to small companies. We have now created one of the most favourable climates for business to be found anywhere in the developed world. Society as a whole is gaining in terms of increased employment and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Government is very conscious of the need to keep inflation under control and to prevent it from taking root in the economy. Inflation is not just a thief which devalues the savings of pensioners and the incomes of people on welfare. It also damages our competitive position as an exporting nation and, left unchecked, would threaten the foundations upon which our economic prosperity is built.</P>
    <P>The rise in inflation in the course of the past year was primarily due to external factors beyond the control of the Irish Government. The sharp rise in the price of oil and the sharp fall in the value of our currency have pushed prices up right across the economy in recent months. The international backdrop is becoming more favourable now and the euro has rallied strongly against sterling and the dollar in recent weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this budget the Government has demonstrated its commitment to combating inflation. The standard rate of VAT has been reduced. The last time it was reduced was when there was a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government in 1991. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been reduced and excise increases which might have been expected in other circumstances have been foregone. All of these measures will have a significant impact on bringing down the consumer price index. In addition, the reductions in personal taxation set out in the budget will underpin social partnership and help <Col N="1130" /> to control inflationary wage demands in the economy.</P>
      <P>Independent forecasts already tell us that the rate of inflation is set to moderate significantly next year. The package of anti-inflationary measures included in the budget will help to ensure that that happens. We must distinguish between short-term fiscal measures designed to take the sting out of inflation and the kind of long-term measures required to increase the productive capacity of the economy. We have already seen the benefits of liberalisation in air travel and telecommunications. We will soon see the benefits of liberalisation in the taxi market. The same formula must be applied right across the economy if we want to see real competition delivering real benefits for the consumer.</P>

      <P>We all recognise the tremendous contribution which the present generation of pensioners have made to our social and economic life. They had to endure great hardships and make great sacrifices and we all owe them a great deal of gratitude. This Government has sought to repay that debt by delivering substantial increases in the old age pension. We have now raised the basic rate by £28 over four budgets. That is an increase of 36% in four years, well above the rate of inflation for the same period. I note that Deputy Broughan and the Labour Party have recently woken up to the needs of the older generation. All kinds of vote-buying promises are now being made. All kinds of commitments are being given.</P>

Its first opportunity arose in 1995 when the Labour Party was in office with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. It failed to deliver in its first budget anything substantial for the pensioners.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a great budget for pensioners. They will benefit from the increases about which I have spoken. They will benefit from the extension of medical cards and free schemes. They will benefit from the extension of the fuel allowance and they will benefit too from the tax changes in the budget. A single pensioner can now earn £8,500 a year without having to pay income tax. A pensioner couple can earn £17,000 a year without having to pay income tax. These reliefs show the Government's commitment to reducing the tax burden on pensioners. Our aim must be to remove the vast majority of pensioners on modest incomes from the tax net altogether.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution commits us to cherishing all the children of this nation equally. Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to parents. As such, it is the most efficient and most effective way in which the Government can channel help to children. Ireland is now a very prosperous and successful country by international standards. We have the resources to achieve great things. If we really want to do so, we can eliminate child poverty over the next three years. That is an ambitious target but one I have no doubt we can achieve. Child poverty should have no place in a modern Irish society. Child poverty has no place in a decent Republic. Our objective will be achieved over the next couple of years by ensuring that resources are targeted to families, particularly through child benefit.</P>
      <P>The basic rate of child benefit has been increased by £25 per month for each child. To put this figure in context, it is greater than all the increases in the seven previous budgets together. That £25 compares very favourably with the basic rate increase of just £1 given by the Rainbow Government in its last budget. Odds of 25 to one sound like good odds and are the odds I would put on the Opposition being elected to Government after the next election too.</P>
      <P>This year's increase is the first in a series of three budgets that will take the basic rate of child benefit to £117.50. Parents will get the second instalment next year and we will give them the third instalment after the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now mention briefly some specific budget initiatives in my area of ministerial responsibility. <Col N="1132" /> Accommodation costs are a serious problem for young apprentices and trainees. Current levels of demand for apprenticeship training are very high. In order to ensure maximum use of existing training capacity and to address current backlogs, it is increasingly necessary for apprentices to travel beyond their local catchment areas. FÁS trainees currently receive £27.50 per week towards accommodation costs where they have to live away from home to access training. The existing payment has fallen significantly behind the cost of rented accommodation and is a disincentive to attend training away from home. Given the critical need to boost apprenticeship training, it is proposed to double the accommodation allowance from £27.50 to £55 per week. Based on the figure of 7,000 apprentices and trainees eligible for support, this measure will involve an increase of £3.6 million in the level of support for apprenticeship. Helping people with disabilities to integrate better into the workforce is a major priority for this Government. The training functions of the National Rehabilitation Board were transferred to FÁS earlier this year. The objective was to mainstream the vocational training of the disabled and to provide greater focus on their reintegration into the labour market.</P>
    <P>Following extensive consultation with organisations representing the disabled and training providers, we intend to standardise the training allowances paid to disabled persons. The practice varies at present depending on the training provider. In the future, all disabled persons will receive the standard FÁS allowance, in addition to a training bonus of £25 per week and will retain full secondary benefits. This will cost an additional £2.5 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>Three and a half years through its term of office, it is now an opportune time to review this Government's track record in managing the Irish economy. Any reasonable and objective observer would agree that our track record is good and that the social and economic achievements of the past three and a half years have been spectacular. We have sought to reward effort and enterprise and to encourage people to move from welfare to work. We have also sought to promote social inclusion in order that all sections of Irish society can benefit from our new found prosperity. As I stated at the outset, we have proved beyond all doubt that there is no conflict between remaining competitive and being compassionate.</P>
    <P>Our policies have succeeded and the figures speak for themselves. Since this Government took office in 1997, the number of people at work has increased by 360,000. The tax burden on all workers has fallen significantly with the biggest reductions going to those on modest incomes. In 1997, the number of unemployed people represented 10.7% of the workforce and that figure has decreased to 3.7%. The number of people in long-term unemployment has fallen from more than 90,000 to just under 25,000. In fact, we are well on track to achieve the effective elimination of long-term unemployment before the Government completes its term of office in mid-2002. In my view, providing people with employment is the greatest poverty fighter of all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The Government has reduced tax, helped old age pensioners, widows and widowers and provided substantial increases in child benefit but these are not the only areas in which its record is unprecedented. In the area of overseas development aid, Ireland, like most other countries, has signed up to the UN target of 0.7% of GNP. No Government has ever seriously sought to reach that target. The £52 million increase in ODA this year is unprecedented, bringing our contribution in this area to more than £260 million. By the end of 2000, we will have reached a target of 0.45% of GNP, the highest achieved in Ireland to date. It is only right that at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, we would be more generous and more supportive of those who live in appalling circumstances in many developing countries.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Government announced the extension of maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, a measure which will support women at work who must leave work for a period of time to care for their newborn. I welcome the provision of an additional four weeks and the extension of unpaid leave, bringing the total possible leave period up to almost six months. This is a pro-woman, pro-family and pro-labour market measure in that people are allowed to spend a reasonable length of time with their newborn children before returning to the labour market.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made to child care throughout this morning's debate. The Government has sought to treat working couples as individuals in the tax system in an effort to create equalisation. That is delivering and will continue to deliver substantial increases to working couples. It is only fair that those who go out to work, voluntarily or otherwise, should be treated as separate individuals in the tax system. Working couples will now take home significantly larger sums of money; a couple with a joint income will gain in the region of £60 per week.</P>
    <P>There is a myth that only the rich pay high taxes in Ireland. Deputy Rabbitte spoke earlier about tax exiles. This budget does nothing for tax exiles. If people do not pay tax in this jurisdiction, they will not benefit from the reductions or from any of the budget provisions. I am concerned that the people who have stayed in this country, worked hard and paid taxes here will now pay less tax &ndash; what could be regarded as a fair share of tax. I am not concerned about the people at whom Deputy Rabbitte seems to believe the budget is addressed.</P>
    <P>Record increases have been made in tax allowances, social welfare, child benefit and the old age pension. This Administration certainly likes setting records and we may yet set another record after the next election. I believe that this coalition Government will be the first Government in 30 years to be re-elected. We need continuity in the economic and social policies which have been pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>This is a fair and balanced budget which provides for an £850 million social inclusion package and a £1.2 billion personal income tax package. Health spending has increased by more than 80% and spending in the area of education has increased by almost 70%. We are now generating <Col N="1134" /> the resources and wealth to ensure a fairer, more decent and compassionate society. At a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, we must target increases at those categories in our society which have not done well in the past, such as the elderly, widows and child benefit. That is what the Minister for Finance did yesterday.</P>

      <P>Like the Tánaiste, I am pleased we have arrived at a position where we have a significant degree of prosperity and where it is now possible to do many things we may not have been able to do in the past. However, I find it difficult to believe that the Tánaiste is the same person who spoke in Opposition about the absolute necessity to restrain public expenditure. The Government has now thrown overboard the public expenditure targets trumpeted after the last election. I find it difficult to believe that the Tánaiste is the same person who, in Opposition, complained about the &ldquo;nanny State&rdquo;&ndash; her words, not mine.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has given us a little bit of fiscal history. Although she claims to lead a policy driven party which does not engage in political abuse, she is quite good at the repartee herself&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and I would not necessarily do any different if I were in her position.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out one or two salient facts in regard to the history of fiscal policy in this country. The fight-back that produced our current prosperity began in June of 1981 when we started cleaning out the Augean stables which flowed from the Fianna Fáil Party's &ndash; of which the Tánaiste and Minister of State, Deputy Molloy were members &ndash; famous 1977 election manifesto. That claw-back and adjustment was interrupted in 1982 for a mercifully short period by a Government led by Fianna Fáil, of which the Tánaiste and the Minister of State were also Members before they had their conversion on the road to Damascus.</P>
      <P>In 1987, a measure was taken by the then main Opposition party which was designed to ensure we stayed on the path of sensible fiscal policy. I am glad it worked and I take some modest credit for that. I want to remind the Tánaiste of the position of the Progressive Democrats at that time. They would not participate but stayed outside à la Lyndon Baines Johnson and the tent. Although they were members of a policy driven party, they did not have the guts to support that effort but were damn glad to follow that same policy prescription when they went into coalition with Fianna Fáil in 1989. The Progressive Democrats did not do much about which they can be proud during a period when it was difficult to ensure that some common sense prevailed in the operation of fiscal policy, and the Tánaiste should remember that from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we will find out whether the Tánaiste and her party will be consistent in their views in Opposition because their prospects, after <Col N="1135" /> the next general election, are that they will disappear.</P>
    <P>The Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance yesterday did not refer to BSE which will have serious implications for agriculture. A huge part of the food processing sector depends on agriculture, has the potential to cause immense hardship in rural communities and requires large amounts of public expenditure for health protection, income protection and waste disposal. There was not a single word in the statement of Government economic policy, not just for next year but in the framework of 2001 to 2003, which is the one on which yesterday's budget document is fixed. Farming, food processing and rural communities are facing a disastrous drop in income, yet in a budget that gave away £1.6 billion to the man and woman in the street, no provision was made to deal with it although this problem has been known and, in its latest manifestation, has been around us for the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>I spoke of £1.6 billion. I am adding together the full year effect of yesterday's measures on income tax, value added tax, excise taxes, social welfare payments and the pay provision of the PPF &ndash; £1,593 million on a full year basis is being made available through all those channels to deal with issues raised in the budget. Not one penny of that is earmarked or directed towards dealing with the problems we will have on farms, in rural communities and for those who work in food processing as a result of the BSE problem. I deplore that lack and myopia on the part of the Government that has not seen what is in front of it or, to use what used to be the Tánaiste's famous phrase, coming down the tracks at us. I cannot believe we have a Government that is so out of touch that in its major statement of economic policy for the year it would not directly address such a big problem.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that rated not one line in the budget &ndash; I saddle the Tánaiste with responsibility for this &ndash; or any consideration in the stability programme document appended to the budget or in the sensitivity analysis that is given of the policy framework 2001-2003. That is the implications of the World Trade Organisation talks for the future of our economic activity and the pattern of our trade, particularly the value and volume of our agricultural and food exports. Two major factors affecting our economic circumstances in the budget framework, which is 2001-2003, that could have serious implications for working out our budgetary framework over that period have been completely overlooked. That omission will have serious implications for the balance of this budget and for the success through that framework period of the policies being put in place. In particular, that omission will affect two of the four stated basic objectives of the budget. They are: &ldquo;to manage our economy to secure our continued prosperity&rdquo; and &ldquo;to improve our quality of life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the executive summary of the stability programme, which is the overall framework for this budget, there are some thoughts on the economic review and outlook underlying the budget. It <Col N="1136" /> states that this updated stability programme is framed against a prospect of strong but moderating economic growth underpinned by a supportive international economic environment. The prospective moderation of Ireland's economic growth reflects the emergence of supply side, particularly labour constraints. It goes on to mention forecasts of GDP growth and GNP growth. It states that a more accurate reflection of national income in Ireland is anticipated to average 6% over the period 2001-2003 and that employment is expected to continue expanding by about 2.5% on average over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I have identified two factors that are not addressed in this budget that could have a substantial effect on the prospects for GNP growth, trade growth and employment growth. To the extent that they work in the opposite direction from what is set out in the stability plan, the economic framework of this budget is suspect. I submit that, on both counts, we face serious difficulties in the year or two ahead. There is more than that. Being careful, our Administration has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the policies set out in the stability programme. The economic forecasts to which I have just referred that are included in the stability programme are based on four key assumptions. They are standard &ndash; unchanged interest and exchange rates, unchanged commodity prices, a continuation of reasonable growth in the world economy as forecast by the European Commission's Autumn 2000 assessment and a gradual loss of Ireland's competitiveness as growth in earnings continues to exceed those of our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>One of those key assumptions is unchanged commodity prices. BSE will have a major effect on one of the principal commodity prices that determines the value of our export trade and that has a substantial influence on GNP. There again the economic fundamentals of this budget are suspect because the Government has omitted key elements. It is based on the assumption of unchanged commodity prices. I would like to hear the Tánaiste speak on this. I have never heard her talk on her trade brief. That assumption seems to be a heroic one in view of what could happen in the course of talks in the World Trade Organisation on a new round of agricultural trade talks. I do not know the Tánaiste's expectation but I took the trouble to look at the mandate the Council of Ministers agreed on for the world trade talks. If she cares to refresh her memory, it is based on the acceptance by the European Union of further reductions in export supports or intervention supports and the probability of further commitments by the European Union to give access guarantees to our markets to our trading partners. Those factors can only have the effect of bringing about a further net reduction in commodity prices in the agricultural sector. That is another reason for saying the economic fundamentals of this budget are flawed and to the extent that it is targeted in a way that omits consideration of those factors this budget will not reach its target either this year or within the policy framework 2001-2003. It is not just regrettable <Col N="1137" /> that is the case, it is a serious omission on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>BSE has not been considered in the budget, although we now know it will have a dramatic effect on very important sectors of the economy. It will have a huge effect on the value of output in the cattle sector. Prices have already fallen substantially since the latest increase of tension. The Tánaiste may not remember &ndash; I am not sure she pays much attention to such things &ndash; that last winter there was a major drive to secure a price of 90p per pound for producers of prime cattle. That was successful and prices in the intervening period have been as high as 96p per pound. Today, they are down to 82p per pound and for cattle over 30 months prices are down to 80p per pound. There is a loss of at least £100 in the value of each carcase of prime cattle going through our factories, that is when farmers can get factories to take them. This week it is proving virtually impossible to sell cows to factories, and the prices are far lower than the ones I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long this situation will continue, but for as long as it does the implication for farm incomes is nothing short of disastrous. BSE has already begun to have a substantial influence on consumer demand for beef, which will continue &ndash; I would like to think otherwise but I must be realistic &ndash; for as long as it takes to put in place a credible certification system so that beef can be safely and honestly offered to consumers as being BSE free.</P>
    <P>The effect of the situation will be felt not just on beef farms but on dairy farms, which are selling animals into the beef chain, in rural communities and employment and income levels in meat processing industries. Farm incomes will decrease &ndash; there is no way around that &ndash; thereby affecting the economy of rural areas and putting pressure on family farm members, many of whom will seek employment elsewhere. It will also put pressure on our food processing industry. God knows food processing plants are key operations in many towns and every part of the country will be affected by this crisis.</P>
    <P>We must ask what we should do. We must first identify, track, control and eliminate the disease for the sake of consumers, in the interests of public health and for the sake of producers. At the earliest possible date we must have testing of all animals destined for the food chain. I understand it was initially proposed at EU level to begin testing in July, but yesterday and today I read that the intention is to begin testing in January. I would like to think testing will be in force throughout the EU from 1 January, but I remain to be convinced that is possible. However it is done the system must be brought into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We must also eliminate all animals which may pose a risk, which will entail huge costs for the producers of those animals and others. The costs will be in reduced asset values, in the reduction of herds and in the reduction of overall output. Serious income losses will arise which will result <Col N="1138" /> in social and community problems. Again, no area of the country will be unaffected. The arguments are just beginning in the Council of Ministers about the way in which they will fix the price for the destruction scheme. This is a key argument which will have a major influence on the extent of income losses and the Government will have to be particularly vigilant in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to define and put in place a system of compensation to deal with these problems. This week's meeting of the Agriculture Council barely brushed the surface of the process. The EU Heads of State and Government meeting in Nice this week will have to give the matter attention. In that regard, I again deplore the fact that a question I tabled to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development asking what proposals for compensation they intend to bring to the summit was ruled out of order on the grounds it was not urgent. The Taoiseach is representing us at the summit and I asked what he would propose by way of compensation measures. He transferred the question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who had it ruled out of order on the grounds it was not urgent. This happened on Tuesday when we already knew the Taoiseach was going to the summit, which begins today, and that the summit would deal with this problem. I am not criticising the Ceann Comhairle or his office, but I do not know what definition of urgent is necessary in order to have something aired in the House two days before the key meeting began, which would see the Heads of State and Government of the 15 member states begin to deal with this disastrous crisis which we face.</P>
    <P>Some measures have been put in place which are listed in the farming press this week. Again, they are only a beginning. For example, to say that bringing forward the date of payment of the remaining outstanding 2000 premia is a contribution to this is nonsensical. That money is already owed and due to farmers.</P>
    <P>We must dispose of all animals which may pose a risk, which means we must provide for incineration of carcases. I was somewhat encouraged when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development stated this a couple of days ago, and I am glad that at least one member of the Government has finally plucked up the courage to say so. I know the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is going in that direction, but he has not yet been as firm about it in public as he should. It is clear we can no longer rely on the process we have used up to now, namely, rendering and storing carcases of suspect animals until we can export them to Germany for incineration. Storage or burial cannot be used to dispose of carcases. Disposal must be by incineration and we must make provision for this ourselves, if only because the facilities we are using abroad will themselves have a huge difficulty in dealing with the problem on their own doorsteps. This is directly relevant to our budget<Col N="1139" /> ary strategy because to provide for it will require substantial public capital expenditure and a coherent policy, carefully administered, to ensure the right animals are targeted, tracked and destroyed. It will also require a clear and determined policy in terms of location. I was profoundly depressed when I listened to a man being interviewed on radio yesterday morning, who is undoubtedly a committed clergyman and undoubtedly has the interests of this country at heart, argue that we should not have incineration of these carcases. I do not know what he expects us to do with them. Does he expect us to build cold stores that will be there in perpetuity with beef rotting away without having any idea what is happening to the prions causing this problem? It is about time that so-called environmentalists woke up to reality. People with that bent should decide, like I have, that it is long past time we let the best be the enemy of the good. We should live in the real world that faces us, not in some Utopia where all these problems would be wished away by waving a green magic wand.</P>
    <P>The fourth thing we need to do as quickly as possible is to get into a position where we can certify tested BSE free beef for home and export customers. That means we must be able to track beef from the farm to the processor to the wholesaler to the retailer to the table.</P>
    <P>The fifth thing we need to do, and this is essential, is to ensure there is common and concerted action on these problems at EU level. The current problem, the crisis we face today, has been magnified by the failure of other member states to take the kind of action we took in 1996. It was regarded at the time as extreme action, but we know now it was prudent. It is no criticism of my colleague, Deputy Yates to say that in hindsight there might have been other things we could have done, and I am sure he would agreed with me. However, other member states of the European Union considered themselves above and free of the necessity to do that, but they have found to their cost and to our cost that was not true. Although we are clearly in a far better position to back-up the quality of our beef &ndash; if the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, stays quiet, as his credibility is totally gone &ndash; and we are in a far better position than any other member state to claim that people can rely on our beef, we are suffering from the fact that there is deep distrust now of the others because they did not take the kind of measures we took in 1996. Although we moved swiftly to act in 1996, farmers here are suffering because of a lack of action in other member states. That is why member states must tackle this problem together. Consumers can be protected only by common action. Consumer confidence will be regained only by common standards and farm families can be effectively helped only by common action.</P>
    <P>At this point and so soon after the re-emergence of this crisis, all I can do is set out the framework of the action required, but we need to <Col N="1140" /> seriously get down as quickly as possible to the business of detailing the actions that must be taken and put in place measures to ensure that they are taken. Unless action is taken successfully along these lines, one of the basic assumptions of the budget arithmetic and the framework for action over three years will be proven false.</P>
    <P>I mentioned my concerns about talks under the World Trade Organisation. It would be useful to recall what happened on the last occasion. The European Union did a simple thing on the last occasion, it sacrificed agricultural markets within the European Union and in third countries to the trade interests of other sectors. When I read the mandate given to the Commission for that negotiation, apparently agreed to by Irish Ministers, I noted there is a serious danger the same thing will happen again. In addition to having to deal with the BSE crisis, we will also have to deal with more pressure &ndash; unless the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development changes this &ndash; on agricultural markets from countries that do not have BSE in the way we do or that do not know they have it because they have not been looking for it. As these two issues move through the system, we will find important parts of the structural background to this budget have been ignored or will change substantially so that the outcome will be very substantially different from the rosy picture being painted by the Minister for Finance and other spokespersons for the Government yesterday and today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a sign of a good budget when the debate on budget night finishes early and we all go home early from this House. God be with the days when we used to be here until 12 midnight. It is often said that when a good budget is delivered the Opposition do not have much to talk about. Similarly, again today, the first day after the budget was introduced, we have witnessed the Labour Party members, whose members are absent from the Chamber, sharing time with each other. Normally Opposition Deputies are clamouring to get as much time as possible to speak on the budget, but I suppose they do not have much to say, given what was delivered by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government yesterday.</P>
      <P>In the area of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the budget is radical, progressive, a bold statement of action and a declaration that the wealth and resources of this country are to be directed as never before towards the needs of the poor, the underprivileged and the aged. This budget is about empowerment, social inclusion and spending the wealth and supporting the weak. It is about republicanism and about equality for all the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than 70 years we have shied away from such public promotion of the real ideological motivation behind our policies. This was understandable. From the foundation of the State up until the last decade, central Government was simply bereft of the financial means to force those <Col N="1141" /> ideals into the positive and effective policies required, this was especially true in the area of social policy. Furthermore, we lived in a century where ideology was much misused globally, where republicanism, here in Ireland, was abused to cloak corruption and murder and where the very term &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo; was more synonymous with terrorism than with Tone and with fratricide than with fraternity.</P>
    <P>This is a new century, a new millennium. Where once central Government lacked the financial means to effect real and lasting change, today we know prosperity. Where once ideology split Europe and masked tyranny, today across our Continent the great majority of political parties are falling into the centre-left, the traditional home of my political party, Fianna Fáil. These policies now converge upon the same beliefs, which underlie our vision of a truly socially and economically inclusive society.</P>
    <P>The republican party, Fianna Fáil, in partnership with the Progressive Democrats, strives for a society where all citizens receive an equal opportunity to realise their full potential. Our aim is an Ireland where gender, race, creed, economic and social background are no impediment to their advancement.</P>
    <P>This is our republicanism. It moulds our social policy, it is our guiding principle, a levelling force and it is the vision that has shaped the budgetary measures we outlined over the past 24 hours.</P>
    <P>In the three budgets to date, these measures have focused on four themes. The first is that we support families. The historic and unprecedented measures I will outline here are aimed at ensuring that any child born into or already in any family or any community in Ireland today will receive the same chance to realise his or her full potential without social impediment.</P>
    <P>Second, we aim to improve the living standards of all those on social welfare. Every citizen of this State who relies upon social welfare deserves and is due, by right, a standard of support high enough to ensure that he or she is not, through poverty, inequality or disadvantage, divided from other communities. Every citizen of this State raised or living on a social welfare entitlement must have a living standard which will empower him or her in every aspect of his or her life in this republic.</P>
    <P>Third, it is our aim to provide real, meaningful and deserved measures for older people. The provision of a decent and comfortable quality of life into old age is a fundamental entitlement in any republic. Republicanism is about moving away from the notion of a person as a simple economic entity or a pawn in the national economy. A person's worth does not end in retirement, and the measures I will outline underline this outlook. Fourth, we are focusing on supports for people with disability and on carers. The 10% of Irish people with physical, sensory or intellectual disability must receive due support from the State. Through this support, financially and through the provision of services, we aim to empower this section of our population. The State must also recognise the enormous contribution which carers make to the lives of others. Their sacrifice and <Col N="1142" /> devotion to the needs of those less fortunate comes at a substantial personal cost. The budget provides in total for additional social welfare expenditure of £850 million, which is no less than four times the level which the so-called rainbow Government provided in its last year in office in 1997. That Government was stuffed with so-called socialists and their advisers. It was an election budget and they knew it, but our budget provides a fourfold increase in social welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputies will say that this is ancient history and that Ireland today is a different place to the Ireland of 1997. They are right and this Fianna Fáil-led Government has helped to make it a different country, a better country where we can now invest real money in building a better Ireland for all. We do not just promise. We deliver, unlike some other parties.</P>
    <P>Just five years ago Democratic Left and Labour were in power with Fine Gael and they gave £1.80 to old age pensioners. This year we are giving them £10. I am delighted to see an Opposition Member present.</P>

      <P>It is not propaganda. It is a fact. It is a pity Deputy Broughan left before the Tánaiste reminded him of 1997; he obviously saw it in her script and disappeared.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, the great socialists of Democratic Left and the Labour Party, together with Fine Gael, gave £1 and £5 extra to child benefit. This year we are giving £25 and £30. Our action programme promised to put families at the centre of all our policies and the budget delivers in full on that commitment. We are announcing the most substantial increase in child benefit since the payment was introduced, in the form of children's allowance, over half a century ago. Not only that, we will invest £1 billion in this area by 2003, which is a threefold increase. This year we are increasing child benefit by £25 and £30 compared with the measly £1 and £5 in Deputy Quinn's budget. The full year investment is £330 million, almost 40% of the entire package of social welfare improvements provided last year.</P>
      <P>In this, the first year of a three year commitment, a family with four children will receive more than £300 per month or more than £70 per week in child benefit. A family of 14 children, including two sets of twins, was mentioned in today's newspaper. Such a family currently receives £813 per month, £9,756 per year or £187 per week. As a result of the budget changes, that £9,756 goes up to £15,000 and that £187 goes up to £289. In effect, that person is £5,280 better off per year just on child benefit alone, not to mention other social welfare benefits that might be built into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that child benefit is not <Col N="1143" /> sufficiently targeted because it goes to all families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Dukes gave me an audience. I remind Deputies, if they did not know it otherwise, this year we are giving increases of £25 and £30 in child benefit. Deputy Dukes was part of a Government in which Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance three years ago which awarded increases of £1 and £5 in child benefit. It is important to remind people of that.</P>
      <P>Over the period of the rainbow coalition the old age pension was increased by £7, whereas we have given £28 while in office; even averaging that over the period it is a hell of a lot more than the rainbow coalition ever gave. Regarding child benefit, £24 was given over three years by that Administration, while we are giving approximately £84 to £85.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes argued that child benefit is not sufficiently targeted because it goes to all families and not just to the poorest. The Government does not accept that argument. All of our families and all of our children are deserving of support from the State. Furthermore, ESRI research shows that around 20% of child benefit expenditure goes to the households in the bottom 10% of the income scale. Only 4% goes to the top decile, so it is an effective way of giving the resources to those who need them. We believe in supporting people in rearing their children. We also believe parents know best and must be given the choice as to how best to care for their children.</P>
      <P>These major increases will be payable to all families, to those who choose to go out to work and who use paid child care, to those who have informal child care arrangements, and to those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way. From June next year, a full three months earlier than normal, some 532,000 families with a total of over one million children will benefit from the support the Government will provide through the enhanced child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>I say without fear of exaggeration that this is the most significant investment which any recent Government has made in the social welfare area. Before we came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased that by more than 40% to £575 million. With this budget's increase, that is now over £900 million, and we are committed to making that £1.5 billion in the next two budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also increasing the funding available in the school meals community programme from £100,000 to £300,000 per annum. This programme, which I launched last September, provides 100% funding of food costs for established community school meals projects providing <Col N="1144" /> breakfast clubs, lunches and after school meals. Sixteen projects are currently funded with over 2,000 children benefiting. By providing this additional funding, I expect that additional projects will receive funding and some existing projects will be able to expand their service.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, an inter-agency working group is reviewing school meals provision. The working group's report will be available by the middle of 2001 and the recommendations will be considered in the context of budget 2002.</P>
    <P>In our action programme we also promised to allow women, and indeed men, who took time out for family reasons, to qualify for old age pensions. In recent years, considerable flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension. More recently, this year's Social Welfare Act provided for further recognition of contributions paid prior to 1953. All these measures make it easier for people to qualify for pensions, particularly those who, for one reason or another, have broken insurance records.</P>
    <P>Currently it is estimated that about 90% of women over 65 years of age are receiving social welfare support. Of these, 87% have a payment in their own right with about 62% of those who have a payment receiving one based on their PRSI record. While it would be impossible for the social welfare system to cover all gaps in pension coverage, more must be done in this area to improve on the numbers receiving PRSI based pensions.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am strongly committed to converting the existing system of homemaker disregards, which help women who take time out from the paid workforce, into homemaker credits. In principle, the homemaker's scheme, which currently operates only from 1994, should be backdated. These issues will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualification conditions for pensions which my Department will undertake in the new year.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided, not promised, unlike the Labour Party which promised but never delivered, that the rate of QAA for qualified adults over the age of 66 will be increased over this and future budgets to the full old age pension rate. I am making a major step towards this objective by providing for a £15 per week increase in the rate of pension QAA for persons over 66 in an effort to give women over that age a payment in their own right. I am sure all Deputies in the House will agree with that.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the PPF working group which is examining the issues of administrative individualisation, and we are going further than that promised in the PPF, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult as a homemaker's pension. The issues associated with the implementation of this arrangement are being examined by the working group.</P>
      <P>On the recommendations of the PPF working group, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has announced that maternity leave will be extended to a total of 26 weeks with an increase to 18 weeks in paid leave. Accordingly, I am providing for the payment of four weeks additional maternity benefit. I am delighted to announce that this will also be available to adoptive parents. This improvement will be of vital benefit to parents at a critical stage in their lives.</P>
      <P>I am also increasing the minimum amount of maternity and adoptive benefits by £8 and bringing the maximum rate of these benefits to £183 per week &ndash; an increase of over £100. In line with the recommendations of the PPF group, we will award credited contributions to those on maternity leave during both the paid and unpaid portions of the leave.</P>
      <P>This budget is not just good for families. Everyone benefits. I am providing for an £8 per week increase in the general social welfare rates &ndash; an increase of from 10% to 12%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings the lowest rate of social welfare to £84 per week in line with meeting the PPF target to increase that rate to £100 over three years. This rate of increase means that there will be a significant real increase in all social welfare payments as guaranteed in the PPF.</P>
      <P>In addition, as I promised last year, I am making further progress towards increasing the rates of QAA to 70% of the main rate. In the case of old age contributory and retirement pensions payable to persons over 66, we are exceeding the 70% due to the measures I have already outlined. I am also providing for general increases in QAAs of between £7 and £8 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that many of those receiving the general £8 increase are also receiv<Col N="1146" /> ing the additional higher increases announced in the budget. Many people are also benefiting from the child benefit increases. A total of 66,000 qualified adults are receiving the enhanced increase in the QAA. A total of 10,000 people on disability payments are receiving an additional allowance and 15,000 carers are also receiving an additional allowance. For example, an unemployed couple with four children will receive an increase of no less than £40 per week as a result of the budget yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that pensioners have built this country to what it is today. We promised to increase the old age pension to £100 by 2002 and this commitment was reiterated in the PPF. Since we took up office we have increased the old age pension by £18. This year we are providing for a further £10 to bring it to £106 &ndash; one year ahead of target. This means that in 2001, the old age contributory pension will increase to 31% of average industrial earnings in line with the recommendations of the national pensions policy initiative. A pensioner couple, where both are over pension age, will get a combined increase of between £20 and £25 per week.</P>
    <P>In line with the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, I have decided to increase the widow and widower's contributory pension for recipients aged 66 or over to the full old age contributory pension rate over the next budget. I am providing £12.90 as a special increase this year to bring the widow's pension to £102 &ndash; again over the £100 target for pensioners.</P>
    <P>Developing a sound pensions structure is not just confined to social welfare pensions and for that reason I am pleased that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed earlier in the year to place a significant emphasis on occupational pensions. I very much welcome this commitment in the programme and because of that we will bring forward a new Pensions Bill early in the new year. This Bill will be a clear signal of the Government's intentions in this area. It will contain provisions for some important developments in the pensions area such as the establishment of a pensions ombudsman, a pensions compensation scheme and the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, a new retirement savings vehicle which I am confident will play a significant role in achieving extended supplementary pensions coverage among the workforce.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget I extended the free schemes to all people aged 75 years and over, regardless of income and household composition. This was an important measure which was widely welcomed. In this budget we are going further in extending the free schemes to all people over 70 years of age. This will ensure that all people aged 70 and over who are resident in the State will qualify for all of the free schemes, regardless of their income and household composition. This measure serves to support older people in their wish to remain in the community and also recognises the value and esteem of this Government for all older people in our community and in our society.</P>
    <P>Some 29,000 pensioners and their families will benefit from this measure and a further 14,000 <Col N="1147" /> households, already in receipt of free electricity and free TV licence, will now qualify for free telephone rental allowance. This also makes a further step toward the amalgamation of all the free schemes into a unified household benefit, which we intend to do.</P>
    <P>I am also easing the means test that applies to pensioners aged 66 years or more who claim rent or mortgage interest supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Up to now, all rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement recipients had to contribute a minimum of £6 per week towards their rent or mortgage interest costs and, in addition, they had to contribute any income they had over and above the basic rate of SWA. From April 2001 I am introducing a £5 per week disregard in the means test for people aged 66 years or more who claim rent or mortgage interest supplement. This will reduce the amount of the personal contribution they have to make to their rent or mortgage interest costs.</P>
    <P>I am making improvements to the fuel allowance in two respects this year. First, fuel allowances will now be paid from the first week in October to late April. This will give an overall fuel season of 29 weeks. As a first step, the current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001. Second, I am easing the means test for recipients of fuel allowances. Up to now, people with contributory payments, such as retirement pension or widow's contributory pension, qualified for a fuel allowance if their income from other sources is no more than £30 per week. This is being increased to £40 per week from the beginning of the next fuel season in October 2001.</P>
    <P>Compensation for inflation in fuel prices is being provided through larger increases in primary payments which more than compensate for inflation. These are paid for all 52 weeks of the year. This is more costly than increasing the rate of fuel allowance but it is a better approach because increasing the rate of fuel allowance would result in recipients facing a substantial fall in their weekly income at the end of April. I think Deputy Broughan will agree with me on this.</P>

      <P>Social insurance represents a key part of our social welfare framework. It plays a major role in Irish life in terms of the number of people who depend on it and its financial scale. It is an important vehicle of income redistribution <Col N="1148" /> and solidarity between generations. Over the years the system has been extended to cover as many people as possible; as a result, we can expect in the future that more people will qualify for contributory benefits, especially pensions, in their own right and dependence on means-tested payments will be reduced.</P>
      <P>Yesterday my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced a number of changes in the structure of PRSI contributions. The social insurance fund is in a very healthy financial situation due to the high levels of employment growth and lower level of unemployment. Although the fund is currently in surplus, this will not continue indefinitely as the ageing of our population will increase demands on the fund in future years. We need to take all these factors into account. The announcement of the Minister for Finance yesterday that these issues are to be examined is timely and I look forward to working with him on the review.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to supporting care in the community and people with disabilities to the maximum extent possible. Our reform of the carer's allowance scheme, which we introduced in 1990, has resulted in an increase of 77% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance from £37 million in 1997 to £78 million this year. Under the budget, expenditure on carer's allowance and benefit will be tripled to £114 million in 2001. These figures clearly demonstrate our commitment to carers during our time in office.</P>
      <P>I recently introduced the radical new carer's benefit scheme which will be extremely beneficial for those carers who experience the tremendous difficulties involved in caring and working full-time.</P>

      <P>The means test for the carer's allowance has been eased significantly in the past few years with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. From August 1999, a disregard of £75 per week is applied to the income of a single carer and a disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a couple. I intend to go further and again increase the disregards so that a single person can have an income disregard of £125 and a couple can have a joint income disregard of £250. This measure will increase the payment of almost 3,000 recipients of carer's allowance. It will also ensure that an additional 5,000 carers will qualify for a payment. The measure, which will come into effect in April 2001 at a cost of £18 million represents a huge increase in expenditure on carers.</P>
      <P>The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. My latest proposals, announced here today, are a further move towards what I see as the optimum situation, which is to arrive at the stage whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for the carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was an annual respite care grant and last year I made provision to increase this to £300. I am further increasing the grant this year to £400. I have also made provision to pay a double grant to those carers who are caring for more than one person. These payments will be made in June 2001 and will benefit those in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and carers who are caring for someone in receipt of constant attendance allowance or prescribed relative's allowance. The total amount allocated in 2001 for carer's allowance will be more than £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking forward, the Government pledged in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities we set was to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development, by the State in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs. There is currently an important study under way into the operation of the existing nursing home subvention scheme by the Department of Health and Children. In addition, I recently initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care. The study will examine the strategic issues involved in financing long-term care. It will involve an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context. The study, which involves the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public/private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area. This study will com<Col N="1150" /> plement the initiative announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance relating to possible tax reliefs for future insurance products in the area of long-term care. These studies will inform the development of new policy measures to ensure that we have supports for caring up to the best European standards.</P>
    <P>We have made many commitments in relation to people with disabilities. We announced the extension of the living alone allowance of £6 per week to persons in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind pension. This measure will benefit an extra 10,000 people with disabilities. It will give them a weekly increase of £14 per week. I am providing an extra £1 million for Comhairle, the successor of the NSSB, to enable it to strengthen and develop its existing information, advice and advocacy services.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came into office there has been a significant decrease in the number of people on the live register. As a result of the changes in the general rates, we are increasing the family income supplement by a record £25 per week, which will benefit 17,500 families and provide an average weekly increase in FIS to those families of £15 per week. The back to work scheme has been a major success and more than 39,000 in employment and self-employment are supported under the programme. We have introduced a number of initiatives in this area and will continue to introduce further initiatives.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to commend the resolution to the House. I have been lucky as Minister to have been able to say over the past four years that the social welfare increases are record ones. As I said earlier, when Deputy Broughan was not present to hear the bitter truth, this social welfare package of £850 million is twice the amount we delivered last year.</P>

      <P>We have lost our sense of outrage, anger and injustice. I am not referring only to politicians but also to the media in reflecting the political message and the community itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> The Minister said he was part of a republican party. I am a member of a party affiliated to the Christian Democrats, the largest political movement in Europe and the largest grouping in the European Parliament. The reason I am in this party is that I believe we must encourage enterprise and use the fruits of enterprise to ensure the causes of social justice are served.</P>
    <P>With regard to serving enterprise, I do not mean that a wealthy businessman should get incentive and reward. For example, if we take two people living side by side, one of whom gets up and goes to work at 8 a.m., puts in a day's work and arrives home at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. and the other, who has the opportunity to work, is not disabled or does not suffer from an illness but does not take that opportunity and spends his or her day in the bookmakers and the pub, the latter person should not receive the same incentive or reward as the former, who makes the effort.</P>
    <P>The society we have developed rewards the person who does not get up and make an effort. If the same two people live in a local authority flat complex the man who works pays rent on his notional gross income, his medical card would be assessed on that basis if he were to apply for one and he has the expense of travelling to and from work. He does not have the opportunity to do a nixer or anything else, whereas his neighbour's rent and medical card are assessed on his actual income and he has all day to do a nixer if he wants.</P>
    <P>People who cannot help themselves should be helped and I will refer to them later at length but we must distinguish between those who cannot work and those who will not work. In that sense there is a connection between the dual principles of enterprise and social justice. The Christian Democratic movement, of which I am a member, is committed to those dual principles.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to how well the Minister is doing in giving this, that and the other to people but it must be borne in mind that the Minister is not giving anything. The Minister or the House does not have the money. The money is taken from the public and entrusted to the Government to use in the public interest. People are given what they pay for but there is supposed to be a redistributive element to this so that those who cannot help themselves and who need assistance or need a hand up and not a hand out are supported. That is where the budget falls down.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was asked about the budget surplus during an interview yesterday he asked what he could have done. It might not make sense to pay off what the Government had borrowed because the amount was so low now or to put more money into the pension fund, so the thing to do was to give away some of the money. According to the Minister for Finance's figures the third highest cost to the Exchequer is still debt servicing. It is still a substantial cost but, nonetheless, I would like to suggest to the Taoiseach some areas where I believe the surplus could have been spent more usefully.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in spending money for the sake of it. However, the money and resources which <Col N="1152" /> taxpayers provide should be used to address the issues about which they are concerned. Yesterday I met a friend who had returned from London and he could not get over the traffic congestion in Dublin city. I pointed out to him that the number of cars registered in Dublin this year had gone over 100,000 for the first time. A couple of friends of mine who returned from the US recently were also amazed at the traffic, yet we think we can do nothing about traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the case I made during the budget debate last year for an integrated public transport ticket which can be used on the DART, Luas and Dublin Bus, to which the Minister for Public Enterprise said she was disposed recently, and which when purchased on an annual basis by the taxpayer would be tax deductible. If such a ticket cost £400, for example, and was tax deductible at 20%, it would cost £320 per year or a little more than £6 per week. If people could travel at any time, day or night, on Dublin Bus, Luas and the DART they would buy an integrated ticket.</P>
    <P>My problem, for instance, is that if I travel from O'Connell Street to Rathmines, I must get a No. 14 or 15 bus. However, if I could get a bus to Brady's Corner and hop on a different bus there using an integrated ticket I would leave my car at home more often. I am happy to leave my car at home when travelling to Leinster House or around my constituency. I believe such a ticketing system would work. It would contribute to reducing the number of cars on the roads. It should be tax deductible for employees as well as employers, which is the case at present.</P>
    <P>A total of 20% of those who attend acute hospitals in Dublin are not from the city. If the integrated ticket was tax deductible, these people together with those who live in Dublin would avail of it. It would make a major contribution to incentivising people to use public transport. However, the DART only operates along the coast and Luas is still under construction, but people could hop on and off buses if they had such a ticket in their pocket. I commend that idea to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who is present, and I hope he will give it some thought. I have raised this issue previously and will continue to raise it.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest other areas which could have been addressed with this money in reply to the Taoiseach. The participation rate in third level education in the inner city areas in my constituency is as low as 5% and the maximum rate is 15%. That compares with an average of more than 50% in other parts of the city. There are flat complexes in the inner city areas of my constituency where nobody has ever attended a third level institution. The population of these complexes is greater than that of a modest sized village outside Dublin. Money should be spent to specifically ensure people have the wherewithal to access third level education and such investment should begin at primary level. A more integrated delivery of services is needed in the areas to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Partnership boards are present in areas which have already been designated as disadvantaged. In such areas in Dublin there are also drugs task <Col N="1153" /> forces. It would be a good idea if there were task forces in the same areas with their own budgets and the freedom to supplement educational needs on a school by school or pupil by pupil basis if necessary without setting precedents nationally. They should be given a little extra on top of their normal budgets but without strings attached by the Department or national implications. Local educators, public and community representatives and parents could decide what needs to be done at primary level, in particular, to give children the necessary wherewithal to equip themselves to go on to third level.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach asked me where else he could spend the surplus I would have said on prison reform. Some 75% of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison come from five identifiable areas of Dublin. I have said this in the House before and I will continue to say it because, if we repeat the message often enough, we will get it on the agenda and things can be done. Those five areas have a 5% participation level in third level education. In many cases in the past and now, young lads who have gone to prison without a drugs problem have been released with one. I remember a parent pleading with me at one of my clinics to have her son sent anywhere but to Mountjoy because he did not have a drugs problem and she did not want him being released with one.</P>
    <P>We need to invest money in prison reform. People ask where is the model in the world where it worked. Let us be the model. We showed the world missionary zeal in times gone by. We were once the island of saints and scholars and sent people abroad to evangelise the world. Why can we not in this small country with a prison population of about 2,500 set the model for prison reform where there is real rehabilitation and investment? What we have instead is a swinging door policy where people are released to reoffend and are imprisoned again. It does not work and we have invested a fortune in this system for which we do not receive any measured return. It would be in the interests of society to invest some of the surplus in prison reform.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak at length on the health services as I am Fine Gael spokesman on the area and it is my area of special responsibility. Between 1994 and 1997 the expenditure on the health services grew exponentially. There was a huge explosion of expenditure during those years. It was pointed out recently to the Committee of Public Accounts in evidence given by the Department of Health and Children that almost 60% of the extra spending on health from 1994 to 1999 was on pay costs. We have all heard by how much the health budget has increased and how it has increased continually. I notice in the budget statistics that, if things continue the way they are going, in two years' time health expenditure will exceed social welfare expenditure in that it will be more than £6 billion. We will quickly reach the stage where we will spend £10 billion on health and still may <Col N="1154" /> not have resolved some of the problems in the service.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of resources. Serious problems within the health system need to be addressed. The first is the need to end apartheid in the health system. The reality is that, if a person has money, he or she does not have to wait to be seen and treated. If he or she does not, he or she enters a long queue. There is even a queue to enter the queue. There is talk and bluff about figures being reduced but that is because people receive two letters and, if they do not respond, they are removed and said to be treated. There are people whose illnesses have changed because their condition has worsened while on a long waiting list with the result that they must enter another queue. They are removed from the list. People who have died are removed from the list. Despite this, there are people in a queue to see a consultant who cannot even get on the list.</P>
    <P>The real measure of a successful health system is that it should be available to people based on their health needs, not their wealth. We have built a system where, if a person has the money, he or she can be seen. A lady comes to my clinic in Inchicore whose knees and arms are turned in and who is stooped. She is in great pain, yet she has had her operation postponed several times. She would never have had to wait if she could have written the cheque. We have read the St. Vincent de Paul comments about the lady with gangrene in both feet who could not be seen in our hospitals. It had to pay for her to be seen. How many of us have poor people come to see us whose children's teeth are growing crooked and who cannot get to see an orthodontist? If the fathers had a decent income, they would not have to wait and would be seen because they could pay for it. For whatever reason, we have allowed an apartheid system to develop in the health services. It is a bad day's work and money alone will not solve it.</P>
    <P>There is the manpower issue and the need to attract, for example, nurses back into nursing in Dublin. However, the reality is that 60,000 nurses pay annual registration fees in Ireland and little more than half are employed in hospitals. Of the 1,800 vacancies throughout the country, about two thirds are in Dublin. It is no wonder we have a problem in the health service when people cannot be attracted back in. There is a precedent in the information technology area where bonuses are paid. There must be a specific incentive to get nurses back into the system in Dublin. If it means a Dublin weighting or assistance with housing or whatever it takes, so be it. We must get them back in.</P>
    <P>In some cases, it is not a good prospect and, if any of us had daughters who were nurses, we would also see it that way. It is not a good prospect for them to be coming out at unsocial hours on to the streets of Dublin to walk to a parked car, perhaps, which is some distance from the hospital. We must think about how we can make it attractive in terms of housing, pay and personal <Col N="1155" /> security. If we do that, we can attract people back into the health service. We can have a system which provides beds not on the basis of budget but on the basis of needs.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that 100% of beds in private hospitals are constantly occupied because a person in a bed is a source of revenue to the hospital. This means that, every time a bed is vacant, it is ensured another patient is brought in quickly because he or she is a source of finance. In public hospitals, because a block allocation is given to hospitals, a patient is a cost so the attitude is to keep them out. We must change that and make it attractive to have patients in hospitals. That is why I argue for a change from the current system to a universal insurance system where patients not only have access to hospitals but where they also have choice because they can select their own insurance company paid for through the tax system. This would mean hospitals would want to have them present to be treated because every patient would be a source of revenue to the hospital. We must make the glass half full instead of half empty and have the hospitals top it up by making it efficient to do so.</P>
    <P>Not only do we need to provide and target resources, we also need to ensure those resources are being used productively. In my previous work for a productivity company, within most businesses and certainly within the health service there is huge waste of expenditure in areas such as energy control, food and purchasing. We need to get a handle on how the system is managed. Instead of having a crisis management response as we have for housing, where we have a forum for this, an expert group for that, a commission for the other and a committee for something else, we need a strategic role for the Department of Health and Children and a total reform of and change in the way hospitals are run and administered.</P>
    <P>We need more managed competition. There cannot be competition as there is in the economy generally. That will not apply. However, there can be managed competition within the medical system where boards are representative of the citizens and where management is on contract, like chief executive officers of vocational education committees or Secretaries General or city and county managers who have a six or seven year contract. If they perform well, the contract can be renewed or they can move on. We must reach that stage where people begin to use the resources they have to the effect that patients benefit and people are rewarded. Instead, we have a system which gives block grants which encourage hospitals to keep out patients. That must change.</P>
    <P>As part of that change, not only should we change the structure of health governance with a strategic approach down to hospital boards, we should also take as much pressure off hospitals as we can and fund services within primary care so that GPs and pharmacies and even community <Col N="1156" /> based hospitals play a greater role. I would like to give a few examples of that.</P>
    <P>As regards the medical card qualification levels at present, a single person who earns more than £95 in assessable income no longer qualifies for a medical card. A married couple who get more than £135 in assessable income no longer qualify, and the figure for a married couple with two qualifying children is £167 or thereabouts. In other words, only the poorest people are qualifying for medical cards, but that was not ever intended. The agreement between the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Medical Organisation allows for up to 40% of the population to be covered by medical cards under the current scheme. It used to be as high as 38% or 39%, but it has now fallen back to 31% or less. Overnight, we should double the threshold allowances so that a married couple with two children, earning £19,700, will be eligible for a medical card. They need a card because by the time they have paid tax and mortgage repayments they cannot be classed as wealthy. They should have that support in order to see a general practitioner whenever they or their children need to. An individual earning less than £10,000 should not have to pay medical costs either. That income equates to £200 per week, which is a little more than double the current £95 limit. They are the sort of income levels that should apply to medical card eligibility because £10,000 is not a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>The children of people living in poor areas often have crooked teeth and they are smaller in stature than others. They are not brought to see the doctor when they have 'flu or when a lump appears somewhere on their bodies. They are only brought when more serious matters arise because their parents cannot afford the cost of visiting a general practitioner. Such parents might be inclined to visit the accident and emergency department of their local hospital because they simply cannot pay the doctor's fees, but they should not have to do so. They should have access to a GP, as of right, when they require treatment, and the cost of prescribed medicines should be paid by the State. Extending medical card facilities to the existing provided level of 40% of the population does not go far enough. We should do that straight away, however, because it would take pressure off hospital accident and emergency wards. It would be more egalitarian because people would have access to their GPs and it would be more cost effective, costing about £130 per annum per head of population.</P>
    <P>Ireland is out of step with most European countries in that we do not provide free medical services for children. I do not agree that there should be a free GP service for everybody, although perhaps at some time we will be able to afford it. I do not see why some very wealthy people, such as the O'Reillys or the Smurfits, would need a free GP. I do not think they would welcome it themselves, in any event. We should have targeted free GP services. There is a strong case to be made for allowing a free GP service for children up to the age of 18, and beyond that when they are receiving third level education. <Col N="1157" /> There is also a case to be made for free GP services for people aged 65 and over, as well as those on the lower 60% of income levels. That would leave the top third who are able and willing to pay for health services. The effect of taking that pressure off the secondary care sector and investing in primary health care, would be that people would visit the doctor more often. Preventative medicine would take pressure off hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>These measures should be coupled with granting GPs a 100% tax write-off, certified by the health board, on necessary annual expenditure for their practice and premises. Where such expenditure cannot be written off in one year, there could be carry forward provisions for future years. This measure would take pressure off the secondary care area and I hope it will be considered for provision in the Finance Bill. If such a step was taken, one would find not only individual GPs, but groups of GPs, coming together to make such investments. It is not uncommon both here and abroad for groups of doctors to co-operate either in their group practice or another co-operative procedure, when purchasing x-ray and other equipment which they will use, thus avoiding having to send patients automatically to the local hospital. Providing doctors with the incentives to make such investments would take further pressure off hospital services.</P>
    <P>Similarly, community pharmacists are one of the great under utilised resources in the health sector, and that should be changed. Under Statutory Instrument No. 150, protocol No. 9, governing licences, pharmacists are obliged to undertake the profiling of patients so that they can give advice to people on the correct use of medication. Some 50% of people do not use their medicines properly, however. They either stop using them, use them to excess or take them in conjunction with alcohol and, consequently, they do not get the effect of the treatment. In turn, that means they end up back in hospital. Pharmacists should be required to give advice but that cannot be done across a counter in a crowded pharmacy. Therefore, pharmacists should be given a tax write-off for developing a private consultation area on their premises. In that way they could advise patients on the correct use of medicines, which would take yet more pressure off the secondary care sector, including hospitals. It would also contribute to finding a solution to the current problems facing hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have produced a document containing such proposals. I do not claim that they are perfect and I know that some changes to them might have to be made. I am prepared to listen to advice and consult people in that regard. If those proposals were implemented, however, they would give us a health system of which we could be proud. It would be fair, workable and could take the lead in Europe. We have the ingredients for one of the best medical systems in Europe because we have well qualified and dedicated people working in our medical service. Yet, we have one of the worst medical services in Europe. We cannot be proud of a service that leaves a woman with gangrene in both feet on the waiting list, until the <Col N="1158" /> Society of St. Vincent de Paul pays for her to be treated privately. We need to implement major reform in the health sector, but throwing money at the problems will not solve them.</P>
    <P>Investment is being wasted throughout the public sector, but the systems in place simply do not pick up on that issue. Value for money audits provide a welcome contribution towards identifying such problems but much more needs to be done. I have declared an involvement with one productivity company, Impac, but I am no longer chief executive of the company. The Minister of State should consider talking to a cross section of experts about how they might make the public service more productive, not just in terms of moving personnel &ndash; although I know there are vacancies in the sector &ndash; but by using financial incentives to get fewer people to do more work. It may be in our interest to do that by sharing productivity with them. We should specifically examine how we use energy materials and how we control purchasing. Such aspects need to be examined across the board and not just at a macro level. We need people in each sector who will implement change. It can be done and huge amounts of money could be saved. Such resources could then be used to keep staff within the public sector, sharing productivity and providing better financial incentives for workers. It would be a good day's work for everybody.</P>
    <P>We should not pat ourselves on the back too much when we throw taxpayers' money at problems. We need to use taxpayers' resources to bring about a fairer and just system which encourages enterprise and is concerned with social justice. In the areas mentioned we have a long way to go to deal with issues of concern.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. To respond to Deputy Mitchell's final point, we have radically changed the set-up within the Office of Public Works to six business units. We have been awarded ISO 9002 on the project management services side. I intend that all business units receive similar recognition as soon as possible. They are all working to this end. The set-up of the GSA has also changed radically. It is now one of the most efficient purchasing groups in the country. I am very much aware of the need to be productive and to give value for money. It is to the forefront of our thinking. We are even producing profit and loss accounts in some areas. That is a radical step throughout the entire Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a proud record of economic achievement and I am confident that the budget will contribute further to this record. It is important to recall how much progress has been made since this Administration took office. The <Col N="1159" /> number employed is up by over 250,000, unemployment is now below 4% compared with 10% when we took office, personal taxation has been reduced substantially, there have been real improvements in living standards for those in employment and those dependent on social welfare and there have also been significant increases in public investment.</P>
    <P>The budget is designed to build on these achievements by addressing the challenges we now face as a society. For the first time in our history we are no longer preoccupied with the related problems of emigration and unemployment. Instead the key tasks today are to manage a rapidly growing economy, tackle our infrastructural needs and implement a progressive social agenda. To recap, the budget set out to secure our continued prosperity, improve our quality of life, promote a fairer society and reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform.</P>
    <P>Securing our prosperity is a primary objective of policy. We aim to sustain our economic progress in order to improve living standards and our capacity to pursue our social policy objectives. The Government is convinced that keeping social partnership together is essential in order to achieve this objective. Accordingly, the budget must be considered in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which has been under strain during the course of the year due to higher than expected inflation. While it is clear that many of the factors pushing up prices are outside our control, the Government has already taken a number of positive measures. I am happy to say that the budget contains further measures to reduce inflation while providing for significant gains in take home pay for all employees.</P>
    <P>On indirect taxation, the standard rate of VAT will be reduced to 20% from 1 January 2001. Excise duty on auto diesel will be reduced by 6p per litre, giving a VAT inclusive reduction of 7.3p. Inclusive of the 1% VAT reduction, this will give a tax cut of 7.8p per litre from 1 January. The excise duty on unleaded petrol will also be reduced by 2p per litre, giving a VAT inclusive saving of 3p per litre by January next.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of these VAT and excise measures is £349 million. They will take 0.5% off the consumer price index, if fully passed on to consumers. I am glad to say that these measures are working as a number of garages have already reduced their prices. Before I came into the House, however, I was informed of a few which have not done so. I urge them to obey the law as passed by Dáil Éireann last night. The reductions were introduced from midnight. I remind them that if they have not reduced their price of diesel and unleaded petrol, they are breaking the law. I urge them to pass on what is rightfully due to their customers immediately.</P>
    <P>The direct tax measures introduced in the budget will provide substantial gains in take home pay and more than honour the Government's commitments in relation to the PPF. The tax increases announced are nearly three times higher than the amounts promised under the PPF <Col N="1160" /> for this year. These measures provide a basis for sustaining the PPF, which will help to secure lower inflation in the future.</P>
    <P>To recap on the decisions taken, taxpayers will benefit by £1,231 million from the following income tax and PRSI measures announced yesterday. Basic personal allowances will be increased by £800 for a single person and £1,600 for a married couple to £5,500 and £11,000 per annum, respectively. The PAYE allowance will be increased from £1,000 to £2,000 per annum. These measures will remove 133,000 taxpayers from the tax net, bringing the total numbers exempt from tax to 668,000 or 38% of taxpayers. In anyone's measurement, this is a staggering achievement.</P>
    <P>The single person standard rate income tax band will be increased by £3,000 from £17,000 to £20,000 per annum with a consequential increase for double earners. The married one earner band will increase by £1,000 from £28,000 to £29,000 per annum, with transferability of bands between spouses thereby increased also to £29,000. As a result of this band widening the proportion of income earners on the higher rate will fall to 23%. In 1997, 36.6% of taxpayers were on the higher rate.</P>
    <P>The standard rate and higher rate of income tax will be reduced by 2 percentage points. In the next year the rates will be 20% and 42%, respectively. This compares with tax rates of 26% and 48% when the Government took office. This fulfils the election pledge which the Government parties gave in relation to income tax rates in the programme for Government. I am certain these developments will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>A number of changes have also been made in relation to PRSI in the budget. The contributions ceiling on the self-employed and proprietary director rate will be removed and the rate of PRSI for this category reduced to 3%. The ceiling on employee PRSI is being increased to £28,250 per annum, which reflects the normal earnings related increase. The class A rate for employees is being reduced from 4.5% to 4% at a cost of £63 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is clear that these tax and PRSI measures are significant and will the boost the net take home pay of all employees in the tax net. Compared to last year a single worker on the estimated average industrial wage has £1,602 more this year due to wage increases and tax cuts. This represents an increase of 13% in disposable earnings, which is more than double the average inflation for this year of 5.5%.</P>
    <P>After this year's budget and including the 5.5% under the second phase of the PPF and the additional 2% agreed this week, the take home pay of the same single workers will increase by 13.5%. This is well above the forecast inflation rate of 4.5% for next year.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the Government is to reward work and enterprise. The tax reform package announced in the budget, with the three preceding budgets, will provide the right set of initiatives to reward work and risk taking.</P>
    <P>Tax measures are not the only way to tackle inflation. We also need to use the tax system to <Col N="1161" /> promote saving instead of spending, where possible. Incentives have already been provided for pension saving both through tax changes and by giving savers greater choice and control over their money. The Minister has announced measures to encourage medium-term savings in the credit unions and is considering extending these to other financial institutions in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is saving a large part of tax revenues despite the tax reductions and expenditure increases announced. It is estimated that the Exchequer surplus this year will be almost £2.5 billion with a similar figure forecast for 2001. In addition, 1% of GNP is being set aside for future pensions. On a general government basis, the surplus will be 4.3% next year, one of the highest in the European Union. This sensible approach to managing the public finances will help to sustain economic growth.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the level of increase of HIV, attributable to drug abuse, sexual activity and other sexually transmitted diseases; and the causes of the significant increases in recent years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2000, 169 new cases of HIV were reported to my Department. This compares with 76 new cases of HIV reported from 1 January 1999 to 31 May 1999 and an overall figure of 209 new cases for all of 1999. The 2000 figures represent a significant increase over previous years. Of the new cases in 2000, 57 or 33.7% are intravenous drug users, 46 or 27.2% are heterosexuals and 32 or 18.9% are homosexuals or bisexuals. Of the remaining cases, 27 are children at risk, three are within the prisoners category, two cases are haemophiliacs who acquired the virus outside Ireland and two cases are in the risk unspecified category.</P>
      <P>It appears that the availability of effective triple therapy treatments for HIV has resulted in the disease being seen as a chronic illness rather than a death sentence, which would have been the case previously. This is thought by many to be part of the reason that people are engaging in activities such as needle sharing and unprotected sexual intercourse which puts them at increased risk of contracting HIV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures on HIV-AIDS reflect those in the developed world with a lowering of cases and deaths from AIDS in recent years but a rise in the number of cases of HIV. We must be vigilant about this condition and my Department will continue to give priority to HIV and AIDS. The national AIDS strategy committee, which I chair, <Col N="1162" /> published &ldquo;AIDS Strategy 2000&rdquo; last June. This strategy sets out a framework for future developments to address HIV and AIDS and makes many recommendations to control its spread. The committee together with its sub-committees, which meet on a regular basis, will work towards the implementation of those recommendations in the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Since 1992 additional funding has been provided each year to health boards to address the problems of drug misuse and HIV-AIDS. HIV is strongly linked with intravenous drug misuse, with 41% of all HIV infections being drug misuse related. To respond to this, health board services include methadone treatment and needle exchange in the range of services for drug misusers. These services have seen significant expansion in recent years.</P>
    <P>Health boards have developed a range of interventions among the gay community aimed at lowering the incidence of HIV in homosexuals which accounts for 22.4% of HIV cases, including supporting a gay HIV prevention strategies project. With increasing numbers of people presenting with a range of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, a priority for 2001 is the appointment of two new infectious diseases consultants in the Dublin area and one in the Western Health Board. Funding for these posts is being made available by my Department in 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department also continues to produce a range of materials and literature to run awareness campaigns to inform the public, especially young people, about the dangers of HIV-AIDS. Specific messages have been placed in the washroom areas of third level colleges and some nightclubs and pool halls. Most recently, the decision by the Department of Education and Science to introduce relationship and sexuality education into schools will also contribute to creating a greater awareness of the issues among young people.</P>
    <P>I will ask the national AIDS strategy committee at its next meeting in January 2001 to examine whether additional measures are required in addition to those recommended in its June report in light of the increasing incidence of HIV.</P>

      <P>I have a number of questions. The Minister did not give any figures for other sexually transmitted diseases aside from cases of HIV. Has the Department or the Eastern Regional Health Authority any research to show that the fact that Dublin has become a weekend destination for revellers from abroad has contributed to the significant increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Does the Minister agree that there is need for a major campaign to inform young people in particular about the dangers of HIV being transmitted either sexually or through shared needles? In the late 1970s and early 1980s we got a terrible fright about AIDS. That caused people, particularly among the homosexual community, to take precautions and be aware of the dangers. Does the Minister agree today's young population is not as fearful of these dangers because it has not been educated to be fearful? Does he further agree that there is a need for a strong special campaign to educate young people about the dangers in this area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no specific research but we have the numbers for the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and 132 of the 169 are in that region. The population is very mobile and I am sure that is a contributory factor in the increase. The sexual mores of the population, especially among young people, have changed in recent years and people are not as fearful. They are taking more risks, particularly heterosexuals. A great deal of work has been done with homosexuals and the numbers are decreasing in that group.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we must redouble our efforts in the education area. A programme is being conducted through radio and television and there is also a programme for schools on sex education. That will be helpful and it is very necessary. The Deputy asked about other sexually transmitted diseases. The incidence of diseases such as chlamydia, candidiasis, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis has increased in recent years. That represents a change in our environment. We have a mobile population of young people. I am not sure one can specifically attribute the increased incidence to the fact that Dublin is a capital for the weekend activity the Deputy described but there is no doubt that people are taking more risks. That might be partly due to AIDS-HIV now being seen as a chronic sexually transmitted illness rather than the death sentence it was thought to be previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disturbed about the account I have heard about this case and I intend to establish all the facts relating to it. My Department has made <Col N="1164" /> inquiries of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and has been advised that this incident occurred in a Dublin hospital in August 1999. By late last evening the society was able to furnish further information to my Department while preserving the confidentiality of the patient concerned. This information was immediately passed to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and I have asked the regional chief executive officer to inquire into the matter at the hospital concerned and to prepare a full report for me as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, intend to comment further on the case at this point. However, this case highlights the need to examine questioningly the arrangement regarding access to needed health care for those who are depending on their entitlements under the public system. In the preparation for the new strategy for health, my Department will consider all relevant issues, including the need for change in the present eligibility framework and in the arrangements regarding access to beds in public hospitals.</P>
      <P>I will revert to the Deputy on the case when I receive the report which I have requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that the facts are clear? An elderly patient, in her 70s, who was suffering from gangrene in both feet and was being cared for mainly by members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, was waiting without success to get access to a hospital. Her GP was also frustrated in trying to ensure that she received the hospital care she needed. It was only when the Society of St. Vincent de Paul offered to pay for a private bed that this elderly woman was able to get access to hospital. Those are the facts and the Minister must accept that. There is no need to prolong judgment on the case although I look forward to receiving the further information promised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Would he not accept that this is another graphic example of the inequality running through the hospital care system that prevents public patients accessing vital treatment while private patients can access it without difficulty? This Government has been in power for three years and has had control of unprecedented financial resources yet the Minister with responsibility for health states that he is now starting out and recognising that there is a problem with inequality. As we say in our document, it is a system based on apartheid.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that this example of an elderly patient being denied care, as a result of which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to offer to pay privately for that care, is not unique? The society on occasion has to pay privately for scans, for example, to give its clients access to the hospital facilities to which they have an entitlement. The Minister must try harder than simply informing the House that at some future date, in never-never land, this Government will address the core fundamental inequity at the heart of our hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been required action by this Government from the day it took office and no action has been delivered. The Minister does not seem to know how to deal with the problem, he is throwing <Col N="1165" /> money at it but it is making no difference. The waiting lists have not been reduced significantly and this poor elderly person, unfortunately, is probably not unique in terms of the experience that has been the lot of public patients and will continue to be as long as this Government procrastinates and proves itself incapable of meeting a task.</P>

      <P>I reject the assertions made by the Deputy in the first instance because, going back 30 or 40 years, we have had a public and private sector system within our health provision. Parties in this House have been in Government over the past 30 years at intervening periods. The Deputy's party, the Labour Party was in charge of the health portfolio throughout the middle of the '90s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dramatically increased the funding. We are preparing and it is a sensible thing to do. We had a health strategy in 1994 which was a good starting point although it did not really deal with the issue of eligibility. We will prepare a very comprehensive health strategy which will map out not just the ideal of achieving something over another six years&mdash;</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the number of beds out of use in hospitals at 30 November 2000; and if he will circulate a tabular statement giving the numbers of vacant beds for each hospital.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28806/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am circulating a tabular statement with this question which details the numbers of beds out of use in each health board. The total number of beds out of use on 30 November 2000 in acute hospitals was 315. This represents 2.6% of the total number of designated beds in the public acute hospital system which amounts to about 12,327. In summary, of the 315 beds out of use, 105 or 33% of those were closed due to nursing shortages, 27 or 9% were closed because of bacterial infection and 183 or 58% were closed due to ward refurbishment.</P>
      <P>With regard to nursing shortages, I have recently announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas, including accident and emergency.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go through the details of that because it is on the public record. In addition, after a successful recruitment campaign in the Philippines and the graduation of student nurses, Beaumont Hospital has appointed 57 extra nurses which will allow the hospital to open all beds by next month.</P>
      <P>In relation to the vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE, virus which is now present in the haematology-oncology unit in St James's Hospital, VRE is a so-called &ldquo;super-bug&rdquo; which is becoming a problem in similar units in other developed countries. The hospital has decided that, in order to protect the health of patients currently undergoing treatment for leukaemia and cancer, to stop admissions to the national bone marrow transplant unit and to curtail admissions of cancer patients. It is expected that the unit will reopen early in the new year and we are putting very considerable investment into the new unit. This was announced several months ago as Deputies know and patients are being treated abroad as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to focus on issues like the number of beds available at any given time. Whilst ward closures due to necessary refurbishment are inconvenient, they reflect the continuing intensive investment in the hospital sector. An unprecedented level of investment is now taking place in acute hospital facilities under the current capital programme. In line with my strategy for the development of acute hospital services on a <Col N="1167" /> regionally self-sufficient basis, the process of investment is aimed at developing a strong network of regional and local general hospitals. In 2000 alone, a total of £23I.5 million under the national development plan has been provided for capital investment in the health services, a significant proportion of which has been directed into the acute hospital area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information </i>The initiative on nursing shortages includes the following: a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service which will come into operation on 1 February next; the abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-nursing&rdquo; courses with immediate effect. In addition, nurses and midwives undertaking such courses will, for the first time ever, be paid a salary. The intention behind this initiative is to remove all financial obstacles in the path of nurses and midwives who wish to return to practice. From the current academic year, all nurses studying for the post-registration higher diploma in sick children's nursing will have their fees refunded. They will also receive an enhanced salary while in training. The number of available places on specialist nursing courses is being expanded. In order to encourage more nurses into specialised areas of clinical practice, nurses undertaking specific courses will now receive full pay while doing so. They will also have their course fees paid in return for a commitment to continue working in the specialist area for a specified period following completion of the course. Funding is being provided to the HSEA to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the pro<Col N="1168" /> vision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad. Finally, a major advertising campaign aimed at attracting qualified nurses and midwives back to work is under way. This campaign is making use of radio and print media advertising to market nursing as a career with the specific objective of encouraging nurses and midwives back into the system.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made on the phased commissioning of new units completed under the capital programme. In 2000, a total of £14.218 million has been provided to meet the revenue costs associated with doing this. This is enabling major new facilities such as those completed under phase 1 at University College Hospital, Galway and phase 1 at the Mercy Hospital, Cork to be fully staffed and brought into service this year and has allowed significant progress to be made on the phased completion of commissioning the major developments at Limerick Regional Hospital. The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system in 1999 was 827,093. At out-patient level, the figures show that 1,992,365 attendances were recorded in that period.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the hospital system is delivering a significant level of activity. In the first six months of 2000 overall discharges, in-patient and day case, are up over 3.2% over the same period in 1999. Within this overall increase, day case work has increased by almost 6.63%. Allied with the reduction of 7,198 or some 19.5% achieved on in-patient waiting list numbers in the target specialities over the first nine months of this year, I am satisfied that effective use of available resources is being made in the delivery of hospital services.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in recent times hospitals providing accident and emergency services, including Beaumont Hospital, have experienced some increased activity. However, it is important to note that while patients may experience delays in accident and emergency departments, appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority assumed responsibility for all health service issues in the eastern region from 1 March 2000. I have made inquiries of the regional chief executive and have been advised that the accident and emergency service in Beaumont Hospital has recently experienced some additional pressure. While overall activity in the A&amp;E department for the year to date is marginally down on last year, nevertheless the hospital has experienced an increase of 10% in the number of emergency admissions this year and new attendances by ambulance rose by 7%. This was against a background where the hospital had to close 64 beds due to the shortage of nursing staff. After a successful recruitment campaign in the Philippines and the graduation of student nurses, the hospital has appointed 57 extra nurses which will allow the hospital to open all beds by next month.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in order to build on the success of such recruitment campaigns, I recently announced details of a £5 million package about which I spoke earlier. The ERHA has been engaged in a review of A&amp;E services for the eastern region. The purpose of this review is to develop a comprehensive policy on A&amp;E services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital is represented on the review by its A&amp;E consultant. In light of this review, Beaumont Hospital is working closely with the medical and nursing staff to implement a number of short-term measures to help alleviate the situation. These include improved efficiencies in discharge processes to allow patients to be admitted to a ward from A&amp;E as early as possible; the conversion of a five-day elective ward to a seven-day ward for A&amp;E patients and the transfer of patients awaiting discharge and placement to step-down/convalescent facilities to a low <Col N="1172" /> intensity area in the hospital requiring minimal nursing and medical care.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have already been planned for introduction at the hospital over the coming months, including the opening of a new cardiac catheterisation laboratory in the next two weeks which will reduce the waiting periods for angiograms for in-patients; increasing the TIA &ndash; trans-ischaemic attack clinic from two days to five days per week; and the opening of new asthma and chest pain clinics.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>In addition to the above, Beaumont Hospital, as part of the accident and emergency initiative, received an additional £200,000 in 1998, of which £170,000 was used to employ additional nurses and £30,000 for medical staff; and an additional £200,000 capital in 1999 specifically for revamping the accident and emergency department. The final cost of this project was £300,000. In 2000, an additional £240,000 was provided to replace and increase the equipment levels in the A&amp;E department.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the authority's winter bed initiative which is aimed at providing an allocation of step-down and convalescent beds for patients being discharged from acute hospitals. Funding has been allocated for a total of 495 beds for the eastern region for the winter initiative, of which 240 beds have already been contracted. As part of this initiative, a total of 82 beds has been allocated to the northern area health board of which 35 beds have been allocated to Beaumont Hospital to date.</P>
    <P>As part of a £25 million package of investment which I announced recently to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector nationally, it is proposed to appoint an additional 27 consultants to work in accident and emergency hospitals. One of these posts is planned for Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, I have approved a major refurbishment and equipment replacement programme for Beaumont Hospital totalling £26.469 million over the next four years. Work has already commenced on this major programme.</P>
    <P>The hospital is also reviewing a number of its policies, including the transfer of patients from other health board areas and the admission of patients through the outpatients' department. Continuing efforts are being made to improve the discharge planning process and the hospital has appointed three bed co-ordinators in this regard.</P>
    <P>The local and national initiatives which I have outlined above should impact positively in reducing waiting times in the accident and emergency department at Beaumont and other major A&amp;E departments. Local discussions between management and staff at the hospital are ongoing to address the issues in question and I would hope that the matter can be resolved quickly by this process in the interests of both patients and staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not very concerned by the fact that although we have not yet reached the worst part of the winter, some 30 patients had to sleep on trolleys at the weekend <Col N="1173" /> when the nurses began to discuss industrial action? The Minister did not address the question I asked. While I welcome Filipino nurses to this country, I hope the Minister does not view their arrival as a solution to the nursing crisis because if he does, we will not see any real progress on this matter in the future. Will the Minister assure the House that the industrial action voted on by 100% of nurses in the A&amp;E department in Beaumont will not go ahead on 11 December? </P>
      <P>Beaumont is a busy hospital and this is a busy time of year. The nurses have no real desire to take industrial action and do not want to withdraw service from their patients but they may feel they have to do so in an effort to resolve a problem. Will the Minister guarantee us that the problem has been solved and that the prospect of industrial action is off the agenda altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee that because discussions are ongoing. While I acknowledge that there is overall pressure on accident and emergency services throughout the country, certain local factors in Beaumont had an influence on the events which have unfolded in the hospital. We are putting huge investment into A&amp;E services and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the hospital's board of management, which was scheduled in any event, was held immediately after the ballot result was announced. I am hopeful that we can avoid industrial action and appeal to all concerned not to take such action but to resolve the issues through dialogue. Industrial action would place enormous pressures on patients accessing services at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>We will provide the hospital with any additional resources which it requires. We have already provided significant resources to the A&amp;E section of the hospital. This year, some £250,000 was provided for the refurbishment of the A&amp;E department, in addition to two allocations of £200,000 in 1998 and 1999 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister provide any extra trolleys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided significant resources and if the hospital comes up with any further innovative ideas, we will respond to them. Contact has been maintained with the key people involved in this situation and I am hopeful that industrial action can be averted. Hopefully, there will be a positive outcome from the discussions later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot guarantee that industrial action will be averted, will he at least give the House a guarantee on one local issue at the hospital? I refer to the fact that 30 patients had to sleep on trolleys in the hospital while 64 beds were closed in the same hospital. Bed capacity is available in the hospital but is not being used. Will the Minister even offer a guarantee in that regard to the patients and hard pressed nurses or does he intend to provide additional trolleys as the winter worsens?</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the report entitled &ldquo;Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study&rdquo; by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I established a broad-based working group in autumn last year to advise me on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. The group is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, consultant physician in medicine of old age. The terms of reference of the working group are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations in relation to such of the following matters as it considers appropriate: definitions and terminology; identification and screening procedures; assessment protocols and procedures; management of sensitive information; recording and reporting procedures; inter-agency communications and referral practices; intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact; any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures; training of relevant staff in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors; and the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
      <P>The group includes representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, the Association of Home Help Organisers and voluntary organisations who represent the interests of older people. The group also includes a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist and a general practitioner. It has drawn up a comprehensive two year work programme which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes, preparation of evaluation reports and will culminate in the presentation of a final report to me. I am providing significant resources to ensure that the work is completed within the timeframe envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft policies, procedures and guidelines will be tested in pilot projects to be introduced in two locations for a period of nine months from January 2001. Training programmes will be provided <Col N="1175" /> for staff members and ongoing evaluation will take place. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess whether the draft policies, procedures and guidelines in the identification, assessment and management of elder abuse, are appropriately designed and effective in the two health board areas. The report is expected to be completed by the end of 2001, when the evaluated results of the pilot projects are available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The provision of a help line as suggested by the Deputy, is obviously an issue which comes within the remit of the working group and will doubtless be considered. I should point out, however, that a helpline known as Senior Help Line is available to callers anywhere in the country for the price of a local call. The telephone number is 1850-440444. The scheme, which is run by a voluntary organisation, is supported by the health boards through the Office for Health Gain and provides a confidential service to older people who may be lonely, isolated or in distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year in Dublin an elderly woman lay dead in her home for five days before anyone found her. We do not know how long she was ill or in pain prior to that. The Minister did not answer my question. Why can a helpline not be established for these vulnerable people? Some elderly people are cared for by their families while others are in private and State care. Why not set up a helpline so that if these people feel ill, insecure or want to report someone they can get help? They cannot be expected to report somebody if they are in the care of that person.</P>

      <P>As regards a telephone helpline, that will be suggested to the working group. I should point out that a helpline, known as senior helpline, is available to older people anywhere in the country for the price of a local call. The telephone number is 1850-4440444.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be promoted. However, it cannot be done on a voluntary basis. It must be done by professional people. The scheme should be put in place immediately. Is the Minister of State aware of a report by the National Council on Ageing and Older People that stated over 12,000 people were being abused? If we heard that was happening in a foreign country Members would table questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and would be telling that country how to <Col N="1176" /> run its business. What will the Minister do about the abuse of 12,000 people in this country? A helpline should be set up so that these people would feel confident making a complaint if they were being abused, living in fear or facing some difficulty. They cannot be expected to complain to a matron, a nurse or a family member who is looking after them if they are being abused by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy points out, the guesstimate &ndash; that is a comparison with other regions around the world &ndash; is 3% of the elderly may be over 65 years. The group that will report will give advice on the helpline as suggested by the Deputy. There is a helpline in place already and it should be publicised. The Deputy's suggestion is a good one. One person being abused is one too many. We cannot accept that. I have advised the health boards to make special note of that, to be suspicious and always on the lookout. That applies to all health workers, be it public health nurses, those in casualty departments, consultants in gerontology or people in community care.</P>

Likewise there is a very good unit that deals with the physical and sensory disability community. It received substantial funds in the budget yesterday. That funding will be distributed to the health boards in the first instance and to national organisations. I met Enable Ireland and am aware of the very good work it does. We will continue our engagement with that organisation. A committee has been looking at the funding of national voluntary organisations and I expect it to report soon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 78 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the issue of a Dublin allowance is a matter that has wider implications for the public sector and would have to be considered in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I can, however, inform the House that a working group is being set up in relation to the recruitment and retention of nursing staff in the Dublin area. The working group will comprise representatives of health service employers, Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Employers Agency, and of the four nursing unions. It will have the following terms of reference: to examine factors affecting the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff in the Dublin area and to recommend innovative ways in which the situation might be improved. However, the remit of this working group will not <Col N="1178" /> include an examination of a Dublin weighting allowance for nurses. The only forum in which nurses' pay rates, including all allowances, can be dealt with is the benchmarking body established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question from Deputy Perry, while I have no wish to pre-empt the deliberations of the working group, the provision of accommodation may well be considered by it. In reply to Deputy Upton, on 29 November 2000 I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service and addressing shortages in specialist areas. The initiative includes a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service which will come into operation on 1 February next and the abolition of fees for &ldquo;back to nursing&rdquo; courses with immediate effect. In addition, nurses and midwives undertaking such courses will, for the first time, be paid a salary. The intention is to remove all financial obstacles in the path of nurses and midwives who wish to return to practice.</P>
    <P>From the current academic year, all nurses studying for the post-registration higher diploma in sick children's nursing will have their fees refunded. They will also receive an enhanced salary while in training. The number of available places on specialist nursing courses is being expanded. In order to encourage more nurses into specialised areas of clinical practice, nurses undertaking specific courses will now receive full pay while doing so. They will also have their course fees paid in return for a commitment to continue working in the specialist area for a specified period following completion of the course. Funding is being provided to the HSEA to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad.</P>
    <P>A major advertising campaign aimed at attracting qualified nurses and midwives back to work is under way. This campaign is making use of radio and print media advertising to market nursing as a career with the specific objective of encouraging nurses and midwives back into the system. I am sure the House will agree that these initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to facilitate the recruitment and retention of nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If this question related to a Cork weighting would we have such bureaucratic long-fingering? Does the Minister agree that, according to one eminent matron of a Dublin hospital writing recently in a newspaper, 60,000 nurses pay their registration fees annually but only half of them are working in hospitals? Of the shortage of 1,800 nurses, two-thirds is in Dublin where there is a shortage of 1,200. Does the Minister agree that Dublin hospitals are sometimes located in areas where there is a danger to <Col N="1179" /> nurses who must leave at unsociable hours? Car-parking and living accommodation near the hospital are relevant issues to making the job attractive. Will the Minister indicate when he will be in a position to report on his findings for a Dublin weighting for nurses and other health care specialists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that a Dublin weighting allowance can only be considered in the context of the benchmarking review and the process under the PPF. That said, the working group I have established will examine a range of areas which could facilitate nurses working in Dublin and may identify areas where hospitals can introduce innovative local solutions. Some hospitals have already begun doing this. For example, the issue of accommodation is being addressed by a number of hospitals in Dublin in order to facilitate nurses. We are also examining the provision of more nurse training places in Dublin to develop a more indigenous base in the Dublin region. Traditionally, nurses have come to Dublin from around the country. Because of the development of new and more specialised services in the regions, they are beginning to flow back out again. To this end we have recently concluded an agreement with St. Michael's in Dún Laoghaire where we will create an additional 40 nurse training places, in addition to the record increase this year, and we will examine the provision of more places across the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that many nurses are of child bearing age and the lack of child care is a real block to nurses who want to continue working either part time or full time. Will the working group address this issue? What timeframe is the Minister talking about? This is a critical situation and there is always a danger in setting up a working group or task force that it may delay resolving the problem rather than meeting it. This is not a new problem &ndash; we have been aware of it for a number of years. About two years ago the joint committee invited the Department to advise it on the shortage of nurses. The only change which has occurred since is that the shortages have become worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true; things are improving. The figures for 30 November&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain how that is so as my figures do not show that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures which the Deputy has relate to a survey carried out on 30 September. That survey, carried out by the HSEA, acknowledged that the impact of the recruitment campaign which was ongoing by hospitals was not fully reflected in the figures because a number of nurses recruited from overseas had not completed their orientation programme or come into the service. Already there is a significant difference, which will be more evident by January. In Beaumont Hospital we have halved the shortage of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> It is wrong to say there has been no change. I have been extremely pro-active on the shortage of nurses since coming into office and there has been a series of initiatives in terms of new specialist courses and abolition of fees for part-time degree courses in return for public service commitments. I have met An Bord Altranais to try to accelerate the registration process and to remove further obstacles in paediatric nurse training, etc. Not a week goes by when we do not continue to re-examine the issue of nursing shortages as it is critical to the operation of our hospitals. Even though we are setting up a working group, that in itself will not be the basis for deferring action. If further action is necessary we will take it and will continue to keep the situation under ongoing review. We are working with all the agencies and have witnessed a far better degree of co-ordination among them latterly than before, not only in terms of overseas recruitment but also in terms of training, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is a serious crisis, why not give nurses an accommodation allowance? Accommodation is a big problem for nurses. As the Minister said, most nurses come from rural areas, and parents are sending them money so that they can pay for their accommodation. Providing such an allowance would not interfere with the national pay agreement. I know of nurses who are thinking of returning to the regions and giving up nursing as they cannot afford to live in Dublin City with the allowances they are getting from the Department of Health and Children. An allowance would resolve the problem.</P>

      <Quest>if any evaluation has been under taken within his Department to assess the total national need in respect of all aspects of hospital treatment and services; if the precise requirement in this area has been identified in view of the increased population and its age profile; if provision is being made to provide a quality health service in accordance with international standards and consumer needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to a review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings. The bed review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. I am pleased to say that funding of £25 million has been approved on foot of the review to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector. The second phase of the national bed review is now under way and involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical specialty. These proposals take account of the effect of various factors, including anticipated demographic changes. The review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>
      <P>Quality of service is one of the key principles underpinning the existing national health strategy and continues to be a cornerstone of health policy. I have a strong personal belief in the value of developing and supporting system wide quality initiatives which have as their principal focus the pursuit of continuous improvement of standards across the health service. I recognise that in health care, quality is not an option but a feature of the service which consumers have come to demand and expect. The overriding objective is to achieve real and measurable improvement for the consumer by putting the interests of the patient to the fore.</P>
      <P>Preliminary work on the drafting of a new health service strategy to build on <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> has now begun. The new health strategy, due to be published in 2001, will provide a blueprint for the strategic management of the health service over the next five to ten years. It will draw on a wide consultative process involving key stakeholders in and around the health system. As well as a policy agenda it will address the partnership process required to carry the new health strategy forward to implementation. The new strategy will inform the quality agenda in health care which I am already supporting through a number of important initiatives. Examples of these initiatives include the introduction of a hospital accreditation programme, governance and management development, risk management, clinicians in management, clinical audit, patient advocacy and the development of hospital performance indicators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Given developments in relation to hospital services and requirements in general, in particular over the past ten years, does the Minister agree that all the evaluation which has taken place, detailed as it is, is insufficient to either identify or provide for the current needs of the population? That was the case five years ago and is now the case to a more acute extent. Surely at this stage it is essential that public needs be satisfied to some extent in order to bring hospital services in terms of quality, standard and availability up to international standards. Does the Minister agree this is expected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree. We must continue to be vigilant in terms of standards and improve them. The hospital accreditation programme is probably one of the more effective strategies we have developed in terms of quality. We have brought in the national accreditation body in Canada to advise on the development of that initiative which will establish guidelines for hospitals and objective yardsticks against which they should be measured in terms of the delivery of services. This is the quiet, velvet revolution which will take place in our health services over the next number of years. We have allocated the funding to enable that to happen. That is happening in the case of all the major teaching hospitals. I look forward to the results of that engagement. The signs are good in terms of the personnel from the major hospitals who are engaging in the exercise under hospital accreditation.</P>
      <P>An area I am anxious to promote is that of patient advocacy. There has been a lack in the health system in allowing for proper articulation of patients' needs and concerns. Some of the groups who emerged in recent times have made a meaningful contribution to that debate. I would like strong patient advocacy structures within the health service and I am working towards that end.</P>
      <P>I dealt with bed capacity in previous replies. I have acknowledged we need extra beds and are engaged in a comprehensive exercise that has been facilitated by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a bed review capacity to enable us to identify not only the global issue of how many beds we need but where they should go.</P>

      <P>Would it be preferable to reduce the problem to the micro factor by identifying a single hospital in a particular catchment area, dealing with it and then attempting to apply that principle to the overall system? What worries me about this proposal is that a good deal of the problems will be dealt with in the future. Having been a member of a health board for many years, I have heard it all before. Nothing has happened in the meantime and nothing will happen unless the problem is reduced to the smallest common denominator by focusing on one hospital catchment area and then applying the principle used <Col N="1183" /> to deal with it to other hospitals throughout the country.</P>

We have selected the major teaching hospitals as the starting point and they are engaging in that process.</P>
      <P>In relation to the medical manpower forum which has recently concluded its deliberations, the idea is to situate the models emerging from that into specific sites or hospitals around the country to ascertain how they would work in practice, and we will do that.</P>
      <P>In terms of the junior doctors issue, we are proceeding on the same basis in terms of introducing models on specific sites.</P>

      <P>The document referred to by the Deputy was produced by the Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland in the context of pay talks under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work. These talks concluded in early 1998 with the issuing of an adjudication board report. The pay terms of this report were implemented by means of a circular from my Department in September 1998. The Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland has not approached my Department with a view to discussing a new role for hospital pharmacists since these talks concluded in 1998.</P>
      <P>Other policy initiatives in relation to hospital pharmacists have since been put in place by my Department, including the establishment of a materials management forum, which aims to develop and agree proposals relating to the procurement process to ensure optimum value for money in this area.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to rectify the difficulty in recruiting and retaining hospital pharmacists, revised pay structures were put in place, which resulted in an improvement in the salary level. It also allowed for entry to the salary scale from the sixth point upward for the basic grade hospital pharmacists. I intend to meet the Hospital Pharmacists Association in January and I would be more than happy to consider any proposals the association wishes to put before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minster agree that pharmacists in hospitals and in the community are a greatly under utilised resource? Will he agree that in excess of 50% of medicines are incorrectly taken by patients and that community pharmacists, in particular, could play a role in assisting people to redress this problem and that process of assisting people should start before patients leave hospital? Does he consider there is a role for hospital pharmacists to become more proactive in informing patients before they leave hospital about the correct use of medicines, what they should not be used with and if there is a reaction what to do, instead of simply finding that a significant number misuse medicines or stop taking them because of an early reaction to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree 100% with the Deputy on that proposition. I met the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on that issue. Community pharmacists, in particular, are anxious to become involved in the major health promotion campaigns in which we are currently engaged. The idea behind the regulations introduced in 1996 to regulate and control pharmacies was to orient and develop pharmacies towards providing that additional primary care advice and service to the public. That was the fundamental philosophy underlining those regulations to improve the quality of pharmacies. That is why I have been so advised by the Department.  I have been in discussion with community pharmacists and they consider they have a strong role to play in health promotion, once the patient has left his GP, in terms of advising them on the consumption of medication, adverse reactions and how best they should take their medication.</P>

      <P>An elderly gentleman from a rural isolated area was discharged from hospital at 9.30 p.m. on a weekend night. As he did not have family at home, he had to ask a neighbour to bring him home. Hospital personnel gave him medication only for that day. As he does not have transport, he was not able to travel to his local pharmacist. He lives 60 miles from the hospital and he was not able to get medication until the following Monday.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister send a directive from his Department that when people, particularly those living in rural isolated areas, are discharged from hospital they should be given enough medicine for a number of days rather than the bare minimum? That would be a simple procedure. It is wrong that such patients are not given sufficient medication. That man pleaded with the hospital not to discharge him that night, yet he was rushed out. That is an example of our wonderful health service.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question on that matter to the Minister, to which I received a reply stating that the local health board acknowledged that the man pleaded not to be sent home. That man had to be rushed back to hospital the next morning at 7 a.m.</P>

      <P>My question relates to starting a medicine plan in the hospital prior to patients being discharged and when they are discharged such a plan should be continued with community pharmacists. Protocol 9 of statutory instrument No. 150 requires pharmacists to meet that role.

Can an incentive be given to introduce a medicine plan?</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 76 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to my comprehensive reply to a number of parliamentary questions on this matter on 7 November 2000. On that occasion I outlined the definition of a personal assistance service and how the service is currently being provided.</P>
      <P>I also explained that the position in the provision of health related services generally to people with physical and sensory disabilities is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance and that all additional funding made available for the development of such services is provided to the authority and the health boards to allocate on a priority basis, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers, including Centres for Independent Living and consumers of the service are represented on these committees.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my previous reply, the independent living fund is no more than a particular model for funding a personal assistance service. The important thing is that the service itself be provided to those needing it. The personal assistance service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care and so on. The provision of a service is most appropriately based on the individual's needs, which may not always be best met by a personal assistance service. The objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the amount of funding allocated for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and having particular regard to the desirability of taking an equitable approach in addressing the needs of all people with disability who require various levels of support. The amount allocated by an individual health board in any year is decided in the context of local needs and in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced in yesterday's budget, additional development funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £24 million, has been allocated for the development of health related support ser<Col N="1187" /> vices for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £5 million with a full year cost of £10 million has been identified for the development of home support services, including £2.5 million with a full year cost of £6 million for personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear and will make it clear to the health boards that 50% of what they will get under that heading is to be ring fenced for personal assistance services. We envisage providing at least 312 additional personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. We are very committed to providing a complete service here and I look forward, for the first time, to significant ring-fencing of the money because there have always been arguments as to what happens to the money once it is sent out. This time we have made clear, as the money is sent out, what amount is to be allocated to providing a personal assistance service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear this welcome news, as ring-fencing of the money is what this sector has been seeking for years. The Minister has allocated money in the past but the health boards did not ring fence it and used it in an <i>ad hoc </i>manner. Is there any hope of putting this on an independent, statutory basis so that from now on, any funding will be independently distributed? That funding could be increased in each year's budget. We would all support the Minister in this matter as personal assistance is a lifeline to these people. It is the one thing for which they have been asking over the years &ndash; that funding for personal assistance be ring-fenced and put on a statutory basis. The Minister can instruct the health boards with regard to these things. He should send a directive to the health boards so that these people can be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to put this on a statutory basis because we are concentrating on using the health boards and agencies as a funding agency for a range of services in given health board regions. We envisage the health boards engaging in service contracts with a variety of organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Organisation, the Centre for Independent Living and so on. I have met the Centres for Independent Living and they do not have a difficulty with the funding coming through the health boards. They want dedicated funding and for that funding to get to the service they require. That is what we are now doing and we will build on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also talking to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which administers the community employment schemes that fund many of the Centres for Independent Living. The hope is that those discussions will enable us to mainstream that scheme under the Department of Health and Children to give permanency to it, topping up the rates on a par with <Col N="1188" /> what is being paid in the ERHA area. Then we would have a good model for the continuing, consistent provision of personal assistance. The FÁS option was very good and filled the breach but it created certain uncertainties in terms of continuity of personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The FÁS schemes were not the answer because they were temporary in nature. It is right that this should be put on a statutory full-time basis and to ring-fence the money for it. The Minister will have met a man from my county, Michael Corbett, and I pay tribute to his wonderful work in this area. He has been pushing this for years, particularly ring-fencing of the money, and he will be happy today. I ask the Minister to go a step further and put this on a statutory basis. He may not be able to do so with this budget but perhaps with the next.</P>

They are making a significant contribution to the economy as well in terms of their own work and so forth. The model we are now developing is one that has been agreed all round and is one the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Mary Wallace, has been advocating for some time.</P>

In view of the level of occupancy in the present system and the numbers who are on the waiting list for services, the ERHA decided to carry out an in-depth analysis of the number of beds required in the eastern region as part of the review of bed capacity to deal with the population at present <Col N="1189" /> and projected populations. An initial assessment of the needs and analysis would indicate that taking the ten acute hospitals in the eastern region, adjusting for 85% occupancy overall and having regard to the current numbers on in-patient waiting lists, an additional 674 beds are required in the acute hospital system. To maximise the efficiencies of the existing bed capacity, it will also be necessary to provide an infrastructure of hospitals and beds for step-down facilities. The authority is at present analysing the number of beds required for the future on a speciality by speciality basis. While this analysis has not yet been completed it is likely that the overall conclusion will be to provide dedicated elective facilities on a number of sites and additional accommodation at existing hospitals rather than a new acute hospital in the region.</P>

      <P>When I raised the issue of the number of beds needed during Priority Questions, the Minister rather testily said it was a silly question to ask. Now we find he knows that the ERHA area alone needs 674 more beds.</P>

      <P>I asked how many beds the system needed. The record will show I asked that. The Minister did not know the answer and has still not supplied the answer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me three sentences and then he can interrupt me if I have not adequately answered? Regarding the bed review, that option is on the table. As I said, the likely outcome will be that we might be better off looking at a dedicated elective facility to deal with a range of waiting list issues or specific areas like Cappagh, which deals with orthopaedic cases. It may mean providing additional accommodation in the existing acute hospitals, particularly in the area of step-down facilities, rehabilitation and assessment units and so on. I realise that for political and electoral reasons people might like the idea of a new hospital in a particular location, and there are people in my own party who would like that also, but that may not be the best way to approach this issue in terms of needs. That is the reason for the review of bed capacity.</P>
      <P>What might be an option is a dedicated elective facility that would not have the pressures of accident and emergency, for example. The one area that is affecting the elective capacity is the fact that accident and emergency major acute hospitals are absorbing huge pressures. Those are the options that people are considering and they are being examined by the process I outlined in my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have discovered that the issue of whether Dublin needs another hospital is on the table, as the Minister has put it, but I have not stated whether I want another hospital for Dublin. I am asking the question. That is what I want to find out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is talking about what he calls another dedicated elective hospital facility, that would mean that if we were to build an additional elective facility at Tallaght Hospital or St. James's Hospital, people would go into that facility ahead of other people on the list, irrespective of the condition of other people. In other words, it would be specifically dedicated to elective cases. That is an important departure from policy heretofore. Will the Minister tell us the philosophy that informs that approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no policy shift yet. It is a possibility that we may be providing a dedicated elective facility. We may have a clearer picture when the review concludes in March. There might be a provision for dedicated elective sites. To a large extent beds that are intended for elective use in acute hospitals are occupied very quickly and hence elective procedures are put back, particularly during the winter months. The backlog then starts again in terms of waiting lists. Equally it could be argued that there may be a <Col N="1191" /> need to increase the number of medical beds. Those are the options being considered. Other people will argue that a dedicated site is not the best way forward from a medical perspective. There are people in the medical area who have reservations about that approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 34 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 11,500 extended care places in public facilities throughout the country. I fully accept the need to further develop extended care facilities for older people. Between 1998 and 2000, over 400 additional places have been provided in community nursing units. A programme to develop new community nursing units and refurbish and extend community hospitals forms part of the national development plan. Over £200 million has been provided for facilities for older people during the lifetime of the NDP. Over 1,500 additional places in community nursing units will be provided under the NDP.</P>
      <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes, as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is two-fold &ndash; first, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes and, second, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the nursing homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the subvention regulations, 1993. The question of admission to a private nursing home is a matter between the patient and the owner of the nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The amount of funding allocated to supporting people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years, from £23.8 million in 1998 to £33.1 million in 1999 and to £38.5 million in 2000. A further £14 million is being provided in 2001, bringing the total funding available to £52.5 million. Some £5 million of this additional funding will be used to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subvention for higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rate of subventions.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Finance have undertaken an expenditure review of the scheme and a report will be completed shortly. Following consideration of this review, decisions will be taken with regard to the most effective use of the remaining £9 million available for the scheme in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>First, does the Minister of State accept that the average cost of a nursing home bed is in excess of £250 per week, and that a non-contributory old age pensioner with the maximum current subvention is at least £50 short of what is required to fund his or her accommodation in a private nursing home? In light of that, will the Minister make a simple policy decision to increase the level of subvention to ensure that subvention, plus a non-contributory old age pension, will meet the required fees for a private nursing home? Second, has the Department made a determination as to the required number of geriatric beds? That is surely a simple calculation. If that decision has been made, what is the shortfall in terms of the State's obligation to provide beds? We appear to have put all our eggs in one basket in the sense of incentivising private nursing homes to provide beds but we do not retain any control over their admission and there are people being approved for subvention who will not be taken because private nursing homes can cherry-pick patients due to the demand. That is leading to a situation where neither the State nor the private nursing homes are providing the required accommodation for elderly people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the average cost per week ranges between £250 and £500, depending on the part of the country one is talking about. I am glad to say that the Minister has announced that the maximum subvention will increase by 25% to £150 which will help&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people would like to wait at home if they are provided with home care, respite care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, etc. but there is always a percentage that have to go into nursing homes and currently we have over 11,000 public beds and over 12,000 private beds in nursing homes. I agree with the Deputy that there is a risk in regard to cherry-picking in that private nursing homes may not be inclined to take in heavy dependency patients, but that is something we have to examine and that is the reason we have to retain an adequate number of public beds also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Minister's acceptance of the point about the risk of cherry-picking, will he, in consultation with the umbrella body representing the proprietors of private nursing homes, consider introducing a voluntary code of practice? Patients who have a heavy dependency with limited financial resources are currently being obliged to remain at home in circumstances that are entirely inappropriate. I accept that the optimum policy is to support people for as long as possible in their communities, but those who require geriatric care cannot get it either from the State or private nursing homes. These people have been examined and are determined to have a subvention entitlement and high medical dependency but they still cannot get access to geriatric care. In terms of public funding, we have an obligation to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>Substantial additional resources will correctly be devoted to persons with disability. I am happy that the living alone allowance will be extended to all recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployment supplement and blind person's pension. Up to now only a reduced rate of disability allowance was paid where a person's partner was in receipt of a full rate social welfare payment. This limitation will be removed. We are also upgrading transport services for people with physical disability. A total of 140 wheelchair accessible buses are due for delivery to Dublin Bus shortly, while new wheelchair accessible DART and Arrow rail cars are coming on stream. I am assured that Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will have a fully accessible bus fleet by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>A sum of £28 million will be allocated next year to services for those with intellectual disability and autism. This will cost £35 million in a full year. This will bring total spending to £450 million next year, which represents a very significant improvement in residential, day and respite services. An additional provision will also be made to increase the maximum grants under the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs schemes.</P>
      <P>Carers perform a very valuable role in our society, a role which the Government continues to support by its decision to relax the income disregards which apply in relation to the means test for carer's allowance. This will allow an additional 5,000 carers to qualify for the allowance as well as helping many current recipients. In addition, the annual respite care payment will be increased to £400 and this will be doubled where a recipient is caring for more than one person.</P>
      <P>Up to now medical expenses relief could be claimed in respect of a relative only where the claimant qualified for a dependent relative allowance. In recognition of the problem facing many families, the rules will be amended to allow people to claim such relief where they are paying on behalf of a dependent relative, whether or not they qualify for the dependent relative allowance. Where a person is employed to care for a family member who is incapacitated a carer's tax allowance is claimable. The amount allowable will be increased from £8,500 to £10,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The care of our children must be our priority. The Government has decided on the largest ever package of supports for children and their parents. A major programme for supporting childcare in all areas has already been put in place. The national development plan includes £250 million for childcare and the Government subsequently allocated another £40 million. In the coming year £104 million of this will be spent. <Col N="1196" /> Child benefit is widely accepted as the best way to help parents and eliminate child poverty. I am delighted at the announcement of such a major increase. Child benefit rates for first and second children are being increased by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. The new rates will be brought forward to June, which is three months earlier than usual. Other key elements of our strategy in this area were outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package amounts to £850 million in a full year, twice the amount allocated last year. Most increases are being brought forward to next April. The package includes the following: personal social welfare recipients will receive an extra £8 per week and couples on full rate social welfare payments will receive an increase of at least £15 per week from next April; income thresholds for the receipt of the family income supplement are being increased by £25 per week from next April. This will result in average payments of £56 per week for existing recipients; and the contributory pension for widows aged 66 years and over will be brought up to the same level as the old age contributory pension over the next two years. As a result, the widows in question will receive a special weekly increase of £2.90, bringing the widow's contributory pension to £102, a total increase of £12.90.</P>
    <P>We all owe a debt of gratitude to the older members of the community. Much of the success we enjoy today stems from their efforts. The Government has made income supports for pensioners a priority. Pension rates were increased by a total of £18 per week in the last three budgets and the full personal rate of old age and related pensions is being increased on this occasion by a further £10 per week. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to £106 per week, significantly exceeding our commitment to pay £100 per week to all old age pensioners by 2002. At the same time, 5,000 pensioners are being taken out of the tax net by an increase in the income tax exemption limits of £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. Furthermore, the medical card and benefits of the social welfare free schemes will be available to all those aged 70 years and over.</P>
    <P>Housing continues to be one of the Government's priorities. The measures we have introduced to date have been designed to improve access to good, affordable housing. These measures are beginning to show results. Housing output has increased by 20% since 1997 to 46,500 units last year. Next year will see more than £1 billion spent on local authority social and affordable housing and a total of £346 million is being provided in 2001 for investment in water and sewerage services.</P>
    <P>Up to now rent relief allowed for under 55s has been significantly less than that for the over 55s. The Government has decided to increase the rent allowable for under 55s by one third from £750 per annum to £1,000 per annum for a single person and from £1,500 to £2,000 in the case of a married couple. In the case of widowed persons the rate will be the same as the married rate of <Col N="1197" /> relief both for those under 55 and those aged 55 and over.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to tackle the tragedy of those who find themselves homeless and is providing major funding to improve services in this area. Capital funding is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years. This will provide additional accommodation for homeless persons, particularly transitional accommodation to facilitate a move-on process out of emergency accommodation. Local authorities will receive an extra £6 million a year towards increased subventions for hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>We all agree that we need a modern efficient road network and a public transport system that delivers what the customer needs. That is why more than half of the £40 billion national development plan is targeted at infrastructure. Over the life of the NDP, £6.3 billion will be spent on roads, with £620 million being provided for the national road network in 2001. More than £2.25 billion has been allocated in the NDP for public transport infrastructure. This will mean a major improvement in the service for commuters.</P>
    <P>From a business perspective, there are a number of tax measures I would like to mention. The business expansion scheme was first introduced in 1984.</P>

      <P>I will conclude in deference to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The budget is a hugely important step along the route set out by the Government and exceeds what we expected to achieve over five budgets, which we will introduce. I commend this resolution to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for being so accommodating. This is a good budget, the fourth in a series of five that redefines the manner in which Government engages with the people in delivering on the promise of achieving a prosperous, fair and inclusive society. It is, therefore, a budget that I, as a member of the Government, am happy and proud to commend to the House.</P>
      <P>It was not so long ago that people tuned in to Budget Statements with trepidation to learn which taxes had been increased and which new ones had been imposed. That is no longer the case. With this budget we are continuing to ensure that all sectors of society, but most importantly the less fortunate and most vulnerable, are given the means to participate in, and to celebrate, the fruits of our economic success and of social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of social inclusion the budget goes far beyond any previous package of measures in the history of the State. An unprecedented £2,110 million is being provided for this purpose. Compare that with the so-called achievements of the previous rainbow Government, whose inability to translate intention into action is legendary. That <Col N="1198" /> Government promised to spend £525 million on social inclusion measures over three years and in its final budget it managed to allocate £273 million.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the record of this Government. In budget 1999 we committed £282 million to social inclusion measures, in budget 2000 a massive £485 million was provided and the figure in this budget is £2,110 million. The latter amount is more than four times the amount committed by the rainbow coalition over its entire unhappy tenure in office.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to again put on record the Government's unqualified commitment to developing a childcare infrastructure. On taking office in mid-1997, we recognised the urgent need to develop quality childcare service provision and prioritised childcare as a central issue on the social agenda. What is important is that the Government acted on this issue immediately. We did more than simply talk.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the complexity of the issue, shortly after taking office the Government established an expert working group on childcare under Partnership 2000 in July 1997 to devise a national childcare framework. The outcome of the wide consultation and discussions involved is reflected in the Government's childcare programmes, particularly the increased investment in the development of childcare service provision and the establishment of co-ordinating structures at national and local levels. The structures are designed to ensure a more effective, inclusive and co-ordinated approach to investment of finance and resources to develop quality childcare which meets the needs of our children nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated £104 million to increase the supply and quality of childcare places. This is the most significant investment in childcare ever made. My Department has been allocated £73.6 million in the budget to increase the number of childcare places and to maintain existing childcare places. I am particularly pleased that the resources have been front-loaded in this way to address the supply issue.</P>
    <P>Lack of childcare facilities is seen as a major impediment to parents who wish to participate in training, education or employment. Quality childcare is not just an issue for parents who wish to participate in training, work or education. The needs and rights of the child are central to any developments. The basic principle underlying the rights of children is that society has an obligation to meet the fundamental needs of children and to provide assistance to aid the development of the child's personality, talents and abilities so that each child can realise his or her full potential. Research informs us that quality childcare provides social and developmental opportunities which lead to lifelong benefits for children in regard to their participation in society, both socially and economically.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to co-ordinate information on the current level of supply of childcare services and the demand for those services to inform the <Col N="1199" /> future development of facilities. Baseline information is essential in the proper planning for the provision of any service and childcare is no exception. Up to now there has been an information deficit in relation to supply and demand for childcare services. My Department undertook the development of a database of such information with the assistance of the EU. The funding was invested in a national childcare census which provides us with data regarding level and range of group-based childcare service provision and the child population on a county by county basis. Last week I launched the remaining area reports in Ballyfermot so that information is now accessible for all counties.</P>
    <P>I am confident this data will inform future planning and targeting of resources, particularly as we embark on our commitment to support the development of childcare under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which provides £250 million to my Department's equal opportunities childcare programme. The funding is being invested in capital grants to community groups and organisations which operate on a not for profit basis; staffing grants to community groups and organisations which operate on a not for profit basis for trained childcare personnel in childcare services; capital grants for self-employed/private childcare service providers catering for up to 20 childcare places; support for the expansion and improvement of childcare training in Ireland; grants to enhance the national voluntary childcare organisations; and grants towards the development of local childcare networks. This will encourage and enable the formation of networks which will reduce isolation and provide mutual support for childcare service providers. It will particularly benefit services operating in rural areas. It will also assist the provision of a high quality service to parents and children as information and learning materials can be disseminated.</P>
    <P>A total of 166 applications have been approved to date for capital and staffing grants to the value of more than £14 million. The grants will support more than 5,200 childcare places in total, including the future creation of more than 2,200 new childcare places. Deputy Noonan referred to this matter in his contribution yesterday and lamented the fact that so little of the money committed had been utilised to date. It may be true that only a small proportion of the money allocated has been drawn down, but the Deputy cannot expect large funds to be drawn down overnight in respect of a programme which only recently commenced. He is well aware that people must obtain planning permission and obtain builders and so on. It is absolutely ridiculous to make the suggestion he made.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally and utterly committed to the provision of quality childcare and this is illustrated by the amount of funding which has been allocated to my Department for the coming year. Deputy Noonan implied that it is possible <Col N="1200" /> to undertake these projects overnight. That is similar to Deputy Owen's feeling on prisons. She felt the building of prisons could be announced without providing the funds. It is like saying one can have a shell without a snail.</P>

      <P>The provision of this funding is enabling community-based childcare organisations to plan and construct new high quality childcare facilities and to refurbish and improve existing facilities as well as ensuring that the necessary staff can be retained. The funding is also enabling private childcare providers to access grants to build or renovate facilities to the highest standards or to purchase childcare equipment.</P>
      <P>The funding will be drawn down by the beneficiaries as required during the various stages of construction and as staff requirements are met. I have noted the comments of some Opposition Members that all the funding allocated has not been immediately spent. I must take issue with that. It is extraordinary to hear this lame criticism. It is absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always open to constructive criticism but I wish the Opposition could at least be consistent. Does it want the Government merely to spend money or does it want an effective, strategically planned delivery of a childcare programme that will exist into the future and meet the diverse needs of society? All funding allocated by my Department under the childcare programme is drawn down in tranches and is subject to strict monitoring, ensuring that targets are met and that the quality of the services are of the highest standards. I make no excuses for ensuring that the moneys allocated are effectively spent in a strategic manner.</P>
      <P>Funding of £7.62 million over the next three years is being made available to seven national voluntary childcare organisations in recognition of the important role they play in assisting the development of quality childcare service provision which meets the needs of children. The Government also recognises that the level of training and qualifications of childcare workers impacts on the quality levels in childcare service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding is being provided to the OMNA early years project of the Centre for Social and Educational Research under the equal opportunities childcare programme for the development of a national training and qualifications framework for the childcare sector. The framework will contribute to the consolidation of the childcare profession. In addition to the funding of £250 million allocated under the national development plan to my Department for childcare, the Government <Col N="1201" /> allocated £40 million in extra supports for childcare.</P>
    <P>Never before has there been such a commitment by Government to make available such significant funding to invest in childcare. It must be wisely and intelligently invested for greatest effect. Childcare policy must provide for equality of access and participation in quality childcare services by the children of the nation. The structures provide for a discussion and exchange of information between the key stakeholders which will impact on a national childcare strategy over the course of the national development plan. I am confident the measures I have outlined will meet their objectives and increase the quantity of childcare facilities and places and, in particular, improve the quality of services for our children. I commend the budget to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A competitive economy enhances the ability to raise living standards, to grow profitable small companies and to provide the wealth to carry out socially desirable policies. An uncompetitive economy will not prosper in economic and monetary union. Economic and fiscal policy must address these problems to ensure the continuation of the strong output and employment growth of recent times. A dynamic, small, business-led economy will sustain the intensity of employment growth and maintain current levels of investment. Growth in the economy needs to be sustained by policies aimed at taxation reform and the encouragement of indigenous investment. This requires the removal of four significant barriers and threats to the ability of business to succeed: inflation, housing, child care and taxation.</P>
      <P>Despite an increase in house building output of 6.7% in 1999 and an increase in planning permissions of 57%, it appears the bones of the housing problem are being moved from one graveyard to another. Demand for houses remains very strong and prices continue to spiral. Progress on streamlining the planning process remains slow and an acute shortage of town planners is certainly not helping the situation. Housing and accommodation problems have the potential to destabilise the economy and are already threatening investor, consumer and employee confidence. A substantial amount of accommodation is required. In that regard, I welcome the provision whereby the first £6,000 gained in rent by a person who lets out a spare room in his or her house will be tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am critical of the increase in employers' PRSI. Employers will pay an additional £160 million after this budget. Added to the £46 million already levied in commercial rates by local authorities, this means the business community will contribute more than £200 million next year. Employers' contributions to the fund have risen alarmingly from 47% to 74% between 1987 and <Col N="1202" /> 1999 whereas employee contributions to the fund have fallen in line with reductions in employment taxation. At the same time, the Government contribution has fallen from 30% to zero. Any additional social insurance expenditure should be funded by contributions other than those of employers given the strategic need to improve productivity and lower costs for indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase employers' PRSI is consistent with State policy. The Government has, in successive budgets, increased employers' PRSI &ndash; by 20% in 1999. This is no more than a tax on skills and adds to the already bulging Exchequer surplus while, at the same time, increasing the cost of employing skilled people. This is an additional tax on employing people. The Government will take an additional £160 million from employers. This is after a 3% pay increase was agreed under the partnership agreement this week. It is important to maintain a competitive tax-PRSI structure relative to our competitors, especially in the UK and Northern Ireland. Employers who run small companies will pay £160 million extra on top of £46 million in commercial rates. All these are factors and someone must pay for that.</P>
    <P>The best way to improve work incentives is to ensure people on relatively low incomes do not pay tax. I am disappointed the minimum wage of £179.40 per week was not taken out of the tax net, as it should have been. There is no rationale in the Government taxing this income. It is unreal that, while people on the upper end of the scale receive a substantial gain, people on low incomes are still being taxed. Theirs is a very small income.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the health levy was not also removed. It belongs to another age when different economic circumstances prevailed. The entire PRSI system requires root and branch reform which has not taken place. The health levy confers no entitlement on anyone and should have been abolished, something that was not done. It is important that it is done because the employer is taxed to employ.</P>
    <P>The economy is going very well at present but business is still very high risk and the additional charges compound the already difficult task of operating a small company in Ireland. There is little or no support for small enterprises with fewer than ten employees, although the bulk of the jobs in the State have been created in such ventures. Such businesses have received nothing from the budget. Property prices, planning restrictions and costs remain major issues for small companies which employ people.</P>
    <P>The treatment of child care in the tax and social welfare systems is a key factor in determining work incentives for spouses and female labour force participation. What was announced in the budget will encourage people to stay at home. A significant amount of child care is provided in an unregulated capacity which is not tax compliant. The number of regulated child care places is contracting although demand will increase significantly in coming years. There is a problem with labour market participation and the fact that the <Col N="1203" /> requirement to provide proper regulated child care facilities is not taken into account in the budget and that there is no clear direction means people will definitely be encouraged to stay at home. The major difficulty in attracting people into the workforce is the lack of a properly regulated structure for child care facilities.</P>
    <P>It was a major mistake not to extend the PAYE allowance to owners of businesses and working spouses. The £800 allowance does not apply to proprietary directors despite the fact that owners pay income tax on the same basis as their employees. A major step towards giving adequate recognition and reward to risk takers must be to cease treating them less favourably than other taxpayers. This has not happened and people operating their own businesses do not receive the same entitlements. That is a major mistake.</P>
    <P>The increase in children's allowance will be appreciated by many people. However, child care facilities are very important and, as Deputy Noonan pointed out yesterday, implementation of those measures is important. While we have an unprecedented amount of money to spend, the major difficulty is getting people to put it into action. A sum of £23 million has been allocated to the area of child care of which only £57,000 has been drawn down. Little thought has been given to the workings of this although each Department involved will have ideas about how it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The availability of a well motivated, educated and flexible workforce working within a stable industrial relations environment has been the root of our success, especially in the context of the expansion of the economy and of new enterprises. We must ensure that is maintained. A competitive small business sector is crucial to the economy in generating employment and income. This sector makes a significant contribution to the ability of the Government to provide the essential services of health, social welfare and education. Small companies continue to play a significant role in economic growth and continue to be the central source of sustainable, long-term jobs. We must continue to improve productivity and reduce costs to industry. This requires an adherence to policies aimed at further tax reform and maintenance of a cost competitive economy. Inflation here is three times the European average, but small companies are receiving little or no support to cope. Due to changes in the PRSI system this year small firms will be giving an additional £160 million to the Government, which is over £3.5 million per week. This was announced in the same week that a deal was reached on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. All these developments represent hidden costs for business people.</P>
    <P>In recent months, local authorities have agreed increases of up to 9% in commercial rates, representing an additional £46 million. The voice of small companies must be heard because they are the people who work 40-hour weekends and are employing people to provide services. The minimum wage has been wrongly classified because it is a gross wage. It does not represent a minimum <Col N="1204" /> income for the recipient because the sum of £179 is taxed. The misinterpretation of the words &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; and &ldquo;gross&rdquo; places additional costs on employers. In current economic circumstances, employees are seeking £175 net in their pockets and, therefore, in most cases, employers must pay the taxation on top. We should never forget the role of small firms within the economy.</P>
    <P>Child care entitlements have not been properly dealt with in the budget. Private community based groups are leading the provision of child care and the Government is over dependent on the voluntary sector for such important facilities. The Government is fighting hard with health boards to put this package together. As Deputy Noonan correctly stated, we have the money but we do not have the people to do the job. Unfortunately, the problem lies in the fact that there is no body to implement a fraction of Government policy. Some 20% of the health budget is wasted, but if that occurred in the private sector the system could not operate. The trouble stems from increasing inefficiency rather than a lack of State funding.</P>
    <P>The Government has got carried away because it has £4.5 billion to spend. Business is all about profitability and keen management. In the business world they say that turnover is vanity and profit is sanity. The Government has been carried away with vanity, but is it providing a service? I do not think so. There are huge deficiencies in the system, including provisions for carers, yet a PR spin has been put on the budget. We must concentrate on people who really need care, including children, those on the minimum wage and parents with children at school.</P>
    <P>This Christmas we will see a burgeoning economy where the rich are getting richer but the poor are not benefiting. Those on minimum social welfare payments will receive an increase of £8 per week, which represents £1 per day, or less than the price of a lottery ticket. Prudent management is required to produce real benefits. We need a system to examine how this money is spent and whether it has made any difference. Many consultants, including Bacon, have produced reports for the Government, but we should have independent consultants to assess the effects of the budget. What did the budget deliver or achieve compared to last year's measures? With all this money available, why are so many people still unhappy?</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of throwing cheque books at problems just because so much money is available. We need to assess how this money is spent and whether people will have benefited in six months' time. We need a system of assessment to discover where the real changes are occurring, as well as their effectiveness. Unfortunately, the Government has been carried away by egomania because it has billions to spend. The Exchequer will get a further £500 million from the sale of the TSB and the ICC Bank. The Government is being carried away with the notion of turnover, while people on the borderline are not benefiting. I hope I will be disappointed, but I think that people in real need will not see any changes. The <Col N="1205" /> country is rife with bureaucracy and waste in every Department. That is the real problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had to leave because I could scarcely restrain myself when I heard some of his admonitions to this side of the House. When the Minister was in opposition he would have been very critical if somebody on day release from prison committed a serious offence. He would have been the very first person to accuse the Minister of negligence. He would have poked his finger in the Minister's eye and said: &ldquo;You have been negligent, how did this happen?&rdquo; I do not hear a word from him now, however. The last thing we would expect from the Minister is silence.</P>
      <P>I am a little sad about the budget. In my budget speech last year, I predicted that if the economic theory worked it would be the first time it had ever worked in recent history. Unfortunately, I was right when I predicted that inflation would increase. I could see nothing else happening because I was comparing the situation with past experiences here, in Europe and in the United States. Every time the fundamental indicators had gone in the direction they went here a year ago, corrective measures were taken, yet nothing happened here. Like someone finding a wad of notes on the way to a race meeting, the Government embarked on a wild splurge, saying: &ldquo;We'll bet on every horse in every race and we're sure to win something &ndash; that overall majority&rdquo;. That elusive overall majority is still on the agenda but it is as far away as ever now, and it will be further away in a year's time.</P>
      <P>My reasoning for that is as follows: despite the fact that the Government has unprecedented resources at its disposal, the situation must be viewed against the background of numerous crises. There are crises in housing, agriculture, hospitals, the general health service, nursing, transport, teaching and crime. There is a crisis in every single sector. At such a time, how could anybody spend money without identifying and strategically targeting the areas most in need? These issues have not emerged solely in the past 12 months, they have been obvious to all and sundry for the past two years at least, yet nothing has been done about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may say it intends to build 6,000 local authority houses, but it abdicated its responsibility in the public housing sector a long time ago. The job of taking up the slack has now been referred to voluntary and charitable organisations because the Government has failed in that area. People on housing waiting lists all over the country are being joined by others. Those in what used to be a higher income category are adding to the numbers on the waiting list. We are now in the ridiculous situation where the sons and daughters of Members on this and the other side of the House will have to apply for local authority housing because they cannot afford to buy a house of their own. That is the sad and stark reality. For the life of me I cannot understand why some member of the Government has not woken up to this. Do they think that it will go <Col N="1206" /> away and that somehow, like water in a bathtub, the problem will disappear? It will not happen that way. No one has made even the slightest attempt to address the issue in the past two years.</P>
    <P>I witnessed jubilation on the faces of the poor unfortunate backbenchers on the other side of the House yesterday as each positive announcement was made. A cheer went up and they clapped merrily and happily. Their faces shone in full anticipation of the following announcement, but they missed the main events to which I referred and about which people outside the House are thinking. We seem to think that we live in a cocoon, that in some way we are protected from outside forces and that somehow we can make the circumstances we do not like disappear, but it is not and never has been like that.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the impervious way it operates <i>vis-à-vis </i>the community, the Government has isolated itself. It does not seem to be aware of the issues I have raised. I mentioned in passing the agricultural crisis. I do not have to enumerate its various aspects. It is a problem with which the Government must deal as the rest of us can do only so much. While we can bring it to its attention, we cannot resolve it. The Government is in the driving seat and it is its responsibility to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The issue of hospital services and the health service generally was raised at Question Time, including by me. I used to be a member of a health board, and all the solutions now being offered I heard ten or 15 years ago. None of them worked because plans were always presented too late. There were evaluations and reviews as well as scoping and final reports which were superseded by others, a matter with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar as this is an area in which he has been interested for a long time. It was never thought worthwhile to recognise that the population was increasing. Times have changed since the 1950s. People now expect and are entitled to higher standards. If they expected higher standards six or seven years ago when there was no money available, they certainly expect a reasonable improvement in standards in terms of access today.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing crisis in terms of the numbers of nurses and doctors available throughout the health service. Hospitals are working from week to week. Wards have been closed due to the lack of staff. Perhaps I am imagining it, but there is no indication in the Budget Statement that this area will be targeted.</P>
    <P>On the transport crisis, trains and taxis do not move, while airports are closed. People cannot get to work and home again, or am I just dreaming? Are we all crazy to think that this is happening, or is it the case that the Government is oblivious to it? The latter is the case. There is a passing reference to the crisis in the Budget Statement. The standards applicable and acceptable in the 1950s are not acceptable today. We are now part of the European Union. The Celtic tiger is supposed to be an example to the rest of the world. This cannot be said of the transport sector.</P>
    <P>On the teaching crisis, parents must find it ironic that due to an industrial dispute a large <Col N="1207" /> number of students cannot attend classes as normal. I have never been one to advocate leap-frogging on pay in the public service, or anywhere else for that matter, but the fact that teachers are involved in an industrial dispute clearly indicates that there is something wrong somewhere. The sooner this is recognised the better. It is, undoubtedly, a factor that many young professionals can no longer hope to buy a house. They will soon be applying for local authority housing. They, therefore, find themselves in a desperate situation. I ask the Minister of State to use her influence with her colleagues to ensure the matter is resolved at the earliest possible date, for all the obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>With all the tinsel, the hoo-ha and the honour and glory, the budget has to be viewed against the background of inflation. The increases, which were anticipated and heralded well in advance, must be set against the level of inflation in the past two years. We went over this course before between 1977 and 1981, much to our cost. It led to massive inflation, interest rate increases and unemployment. If we continue as we are, we will certainly end up in the same position. That is not in doubt. I suspect the Government is hoping it will achieve an overall majority before that happens, at which time the shutters will come down.</P>
    <P>I got so upset when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was loquacious that I forget to mention the general situation on crime, which does not seem to feature in the Government's thinking in terms of the budget. Not only can one not get a house, get into school or hospital, on a train or in a taxi, neither is it safe to walk the streets at night without being attacked and mugged or, in some cases, killed.</P>
    <P>Against all those backgrounds, each applicable to an individual Minister, about what exactly was the Government thinking in the compilation of the budget? It always seems to make comparisons with the rainbow coalition in its last year in office. In the immortal words of certain members of the Government, that was then, this is now. It will have to be prepared at some stage to accept full responsibility for what is happening, not just seek the acclaim which goes with the spending of large amounts of money, regardless of whether it is targeted in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is much more that I would like to say, but I will leave the Minister of State opposite with the following reminder. Women in the home, who were singularly neglected by the Government last year and this year, have a certain message for the Government. They will give it when the time comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltímse go mór agus ó chroí roimh an cháinaisnéis mar creidim go láidir go ndéanfaidh sé an difríocht do chuile dhuine sa tír seo agus go háirithe do pháistí. As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I believe this is the first children's budget in the history of the State. It gives financial backing to <Col N="1208" /> our policies and initiatives and to our commitment to the children of this country.</P>
      <P>That commitment is evident from the publication recently of the national children's strategy which sets out a plan for the delivery of services and support for children over the next ten years to ensure we support them not in a crisis driven manner but in a way that is planned, organised and cross departmental. Today's announcement and the budget yesterday focused on those children who need particular care and support, the most vulnerable children in our community. Among them I include the children who, for a variety of reasons, must come into the care of the State. They are unable to remain with their families.</P>
      <P>Everybody will accept that the best place for a child is within its family. However, there are over 3,000 children in foster care. Those foster families provide love, care, protection and support to children and young people who are not able to remain within their own families. For many years those foster families did not get the support and recognition which they, as parents, deserved for the valuable support they give our children. As part of the £9 million for fostering which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, announced yesterday, I was delighted today to announce an increase in foster payments and allowances for those families.</P>
      <P>The payment for children under the age of 12 years was £71.55. Today I announced that it is being increased to £200 per week. The payment for a child aged 12 years and over was £85.55 per week and that will be increased to £220 per week. Prior to this foster families had to go to the health boards, cap in hand, looking for discretionary payments. Different amounts were given out by different health boards at different times. It was not right that these families had to plead, &ldquo;The child I am looking after, who is at risk and vulnerable, is making her First Communion and I need money; please help&rdquo; or &ldquo;The child is getting big and needs bigger clothes and shoes and I need extra funding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All the discretionary payments will now be abolished and the substantial payment will be given to those foster parents. We value their role and the contribution they make to supporting children who are at risk. These children and young people need that love, care and protection. The role of foster parents is crucial in the continuum of care for children.</P>
      <P>Of course, the first choice is that these children would remain within their families. Today we announced an extra £2 million for family support, to identify families who need extra help. Families will be supported through teenage parenting projects, an extension of the springboard project for Loughlinstown and Darndale, community mothers projects and so forth so we can identify and help children within their families. Where that is not possible, however, we have announced further supports for the foster families who provide such valuable support and care.</P>

      <P>The first three items for debate on the Adjournment relate to the closure of Motorola in Swords and are being taken together. Each Deputy will have five minutes and the Tánaiste will have 15 minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording us the opportunity of raising this important issue. It is with a deep sense of sadness I address the House and the Tánaiste following the decision taken by the management of Motorola in Chicago to outsource its manufacturing base in Swords, with such drastic repercussions for the workforce. The decision was taken, we are informed, without any consultation with the workforce, the IDA or the Tánaiste and is a chilling reminder of the risks inherent in a reliance on multinational capital.</P>
      <P>Like many people in Swords, the wider Dublin area and Counties Louth, Meath and Kildare, I was shocked and annoyed at the manner in which Motorola announced 750 job losses at its plant in Swords. This is a cruel blow only weeks before Christmas. A total of 750 workers, with mortgages and families to support, have been abandoned by Motorola. These workers have given years of dedicated service to the company. They have played a leading role in establishing Ireland's reputation as a location for the technological and communications industry.</P>
      <P>It is beyond belief that the company would treat its staff in this callous manner. However, it is our duty to look to the future. The 750 workers who have lost their jobs need every assistance from State agencies such as FÁS and the IDA to find new, well paid employment. The job losses will have a devastating effect on the economic life of Swords and the wider catchment area of north County Dublin. No stone should be left unturned in our efforts to find new opportunities for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government must guarantee the 750 workers who have lost their jobs that every effort will be made to assist them in securing new employment. A skills audit of the workforce <Col N="1209" /><Col N="1210" /> designed to update workers for current employment opportunities in the high-tech sector must be conducted immediately and training courses should be put in place if necessary.</P>
    <P>I note from the Tánaiste's statement yesterday that she is confident the Motorola workers will find new employment. I was somewhat taken aback by the certainty of her statement but I accept that a number of companies in the technology sector are currently seeking workers. It is essential that these vacancies are matched with the Motorola workforce. I urge the Minister to ensure that the company provides an immediate opportunity for alternative employers to meet and interview workers on site at the Motorola plant. Given the scandalous manner in which Motorola treated its staff in the last 24 hours, the company should be put under pressure to facilitate this initiative.</P>
    <P>There is also an obligation on the Tánaiste to ensure that the IDA does everything in its power to attract a new investor to the Motorola plant. A state of the art factory will lie idle in the heart of north Dublin. The Tánaiste must take the lead in finding a replacement industry for the plant. Motorola now joins the bleak list of names such as Packard, Seagate and Digital which are associated with massive job losses in our economy. The job loss yesterday is, without doubt, one of the largest we have experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>We can never be complacent about redundancies or job losses. There is a real story of personal hardship and tragedy behind every worker made redundant. Priority must now be given to the workers at Motorola who have suffered such a cruel blow so close to Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement yesterday of the loss of 750 jobs in Motorola in Swords is a catastrophe both for the workers concerned and also for the Swords area and the north Dublin region generally. It is particularly devastating coming so close to Christmas, a time when people plan to be with their families and enjoy their free time. Could the Tánaiste clarify why this company is closing down this number of jobs? In August 1999, the Tánaiste was present when a major high profile announcement was made that 500 new jobs were being created in Motorola to bring the workforce to 1,700 people. The current workforce stands at 1,400 so even that promise was not delivered on. Were there any signals given to the Tánaiste at that time? Now we have this catastrophic news of the loss of 750 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Tánaiste tell the House how long she has known about these losses, what actions she took to prevent them and what actions Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland took to save these jobs, if at all possible? I have been told that these jobs are going directly to China. Could she confirm that or tell us whether she knows where the work done by these workers is now to be done? Is there any truth in the rumour that strong pressure was put on Motorola UK to avoid announcing these losses on budget day so it would not interfere with the hype of the budget? That would be disgraceful if it was the case. It may explain the unwieldy and unsatisfactory way in which the <Col N="1211" /> employees heard about the losses. Can the Tánaiste give any indication whether the job losses are as a result of overcapacity in the mobile phone market and the high wage costs due to Ireland's high inflation rate? These are the other reasons I have been given for these lost jobs.</P>
    <P>If these losses are in any way due to overcapacity in the marketplace, one would have to be concerned for other sections of the telecommunications industry and the mobile phone industry which have expanded so rapidly in Ireland. It is essential that the Minister confirms she is satisfied that these announced job losses are not the first in a series of job losses countrywide in this industry.</P>
    <P>Motorola, as a company, has given great employment for hundreds of people living in Swords and the surrounding towns and villages of north Dublin. Many people have received excellent training with Motorola and have gone on to other high-tech firms, both in Swords and elsewhere. Many of the workers are young people and I hope that because of the skills they acquired in Motorola, they will not have too much difficulty in finding other work. However, many have purchased homes for their families in Swords and the neighbouring areas to be close to their workplace. These people may now find they must seek employment in Blanchardstown or further afield, thereby adding to the enormous traffic congestion on the M1 motorway and on all access routes from north Dublin into the city and elsewhere, every morning and evening. Many other employees have been renting properties in Swords. The job losses will also have a disastrous effect on these rent arrangements as people may have to leave at short notice to seek employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is never a good time to make these announcements but I am critical of how the announcement was made, particularly <i>vis-à-vis</i> a large number of employees who left their shift work in the morning at about 7.00 a.m. and woke in the early afternoon to hear the news on the radio or receive it by telephone from colleagues who were at work when the announcement was made.</P>
    <P>This is not the way to inform a dedicated workforce about the loss of their jobs. I ask the Tánaiste to indicate my annoyance to senior management on this issue. This type of discourtesy and lack of consideration happens too often when these kinds of announcements are made. It is a matter for the Tánaiste as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to speak with the management of these companies to make sure the employees are properly informed about pending doom in as sensitive a way as possible.</P>
    <P>I note that 650 of the 1,400 will be maintained by Celestica, who will purchase the Motorola plant in Swords. I remind the Tánaiste of what she said in August 1999 when she paid tribute to the skills base. She said that it is a fantastic facility in Swords and would get much bigger. Unfortunately, her word have not come true. Not only have all 500 jobs promised then not materialised <Col N="1212" /> but now we have this terrible blow. I understand that even as we speak, a full staff meeting is taking place. I hope that a proper redundancy package will be prepared for those leaving which might help somewhat. I urge the Tánaiste to seek out a new industry to take over the fine facility of Celestica which will be available when they move to the Motorola plant in Balheary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with my two colleagues the sheer disappointment, about which I had a chance to talk to the Tánaiste in the past 24 hours, regarding this most untimely announcement of the loss of 750 jobs and the outsourcing of certain parts of the Motorola operation at Swords. As my colleagues rightly stated, the timing of this announcement and the way it was made left a great deal to be desired. It is very difficult for young people who gave a tremendous commitment to a company and have shown that by their skills, to be treated in such a way over the past 24 hours. It is not the way to do business. We have heard a great deal in politics and business recently about communication and the lack thereof. This was one example of how not to do business, one which, if it concerned an Irish company, I suspect would cause an outcry currently in the context of how business is done and the management involved.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste had to deal with this type of announcement in her own constituency in past years. It is not easy. I was in Swords earlier this morning to meet various community groups. Those who should know what is going on in the community, such as ourselves, leaders in the community and various other organisations in Fingal, had absolutely no knowledge of this announcement. I thank the Tánaiste and her office over the past hours in the context of how she hopes to deal with this matter. I asked that as a first step, subject to the type of groups that should meet the Tánaiste, every effort is made, on which she and her office have given a commitment, to make sure every State agency and power within her remit is made available to those unfortunate people that between now and the end of January will be without a job. Every effort should be made to ensure that the types of skills that we are aware are available, will be assessed, as my colleague Deputy Ryan stated. An assessment should be made so that we know the resources available in the area for other companies to avail of. We should make every effort to repair the devastation of such a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember being part of a council in which there was tremendous excitement, when Motorola first came to Swords in the mid-1980s, about this plant in a greenfield site. It has given tremendous employment over the past ten to 15 years in Swords. It is a phenomenal facility which should not go to waste and one which should be marketed at the highest level by the IDA and other groups. We are extremely lucky that a sister company is in Swords, that we are not talking about the loss of 1,450 jobs and that 650 will be saved. I hope with the proper expertise, that between now and the spring of 2001, we can avail of <Col N="1213" /> opportunities and bring another company into the area.</P>
    <P>There is no better place than the Swords and wider Fingal area to market for an investment of the type which currently needs to be replaced. Swords has a location beside the airport, it has motorways, the Belfast-Dublin corridor and the tunnel. Every service needed is in place. We now have the skills of a young, committed workforce. The IDA and all its sister companies and State agencies should be brought to bear to ensure that a proper effort is made to replace this plant. All the elected representatives for the area will do what we can to encourage the type of investment that has come to Swords and Fingal in past years. Will the Tánaiste, as soon as possible, meet the various groups which have contacted us to discuss the efforts she intends to make within the Department and the agencies under its aegis to replace these jobs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Owen, Seán Ryan and Wright for raising this matter. Deputy Owen suggested that the company was asked not to make this announcement prior to the budget. I do not know who implied that but I hope it is not being suggested that either I or IDA representatives asked the company not to announce the job losses prior to the budget.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed to learn of the decision by Motorola to dispose of its facility in Swords with the loss of 723 jobs. I was informed of the decision to sell the plant to Celestica by Motorola management on Tuesday evening last. Motorola and Celestica management visited the IDA on Tuesday morning. The IDA contacted me as I was returning from Brussels and the management came to see me in my Dáil office at 5 p.m. that day.</P>
      <P>Motorola commenced operations in Holylands, Swords, in 1989 to manufacture batteries, pagers and two-way radios. Employment reached 1,300 but due to a major slump in the paging business and an overall downturn in Motorola's business worldwide, employment at the Swords plant fell to 1,100 in mid-1999. However, in August 1999, due to the quality and past performance of the Irish plant, it was decided to introduce cellular phone manufacture to substitute for the loss of business in the paging products which transferred to the Far East. This involved an investment of $30 million. Employment had increased to 1,400 at Swords and was expected to grow to 2,500 by the end of the year 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Motorola is now involved in global restructuring, driven largely by cost pressures and excess capacity. On 6 December 2000, Motorola and Celestica announced a strategic manufacturing worldwide alliance with a total estimated value of more then $1 billion over the next three years. Under the terms of the agreement, Motorola will sell its manufacturing operations in Dublin and Iowa to Celestica for approximately $70 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and <Col N="1214" /> will outsource the manufacturing of some cellular phone handsets, massaging devices, two-way radio products and accessories to Celestica. This is the second outsourcing agreement Motorola has announced this year. This agreement is part of a long-term company-wide strategy to improve supply chain efficiencies, consolidate manufacturing and restructure to improve its financial performance. For Motorola, the manufacturing consolidation will result in the elimination of approximately 2,870 positions out of a total workforce of 130,000 worldwide.</P>
    <P>The agreement is expected to close in the first quarter of 2001. Celestica will continue manufacturing the products and accessories I mentioned earlier for at least two years in Dublin and will offer positions to approximately 650 of Motorola's 1,400 Dublin employees. Severance and outplacement benefits, as well as the opportunity to apply for other positions within Motorola will be provided to eligible employees. Redundancies, which will be on a voluntary basis, will begin to take effect in the first quarter of 2001 and will be completed by the summer. Motorola management has informed me that the first redundancies will take effect from late February-early March.</P>
    <P>The restructuring agreement with Celestica will not impact on Motorola's Cork operations in which more than 500 people are employed. With more than 25,000 employees worldwide, Celestica operates 33 manufacturing and design facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Brazil. Celestica provides a broad range of services including design, prototyping, assembly, testing, product assurance, supply chain management, worldwide distribution and after-sales service. Its customers include industry leading original equipment manufacturers, primarily in the information technology and communications sectors. There is an increasing requirement for contract manufacture in Ireland and Celestica would hope to grow its Irish operation in line with market growth, particularly in the fast expanding telecommunications sector. It has moved significantly to high end and more complex products for such customers as Hewlett Packard, Lucent, Sun etc., and is recognised as one of the major players in optical networking technology.</P>
    <P>Motorola's Swords facility is located in Fingal. Fingal has outperformed every region in Ireland over the past decade in terms of IDA-assisted companies. These companies employed 2,500 people in 1990 and currently employ 12,000 in permanent positions, an increase of 400%. Year 2000 results are expected to confirm that this growth is being maintained. Workers at the Swords facility were drawn from a wide catchment area including Meath, north Kildare, west Dublin, north Dublin, the city centre and other locations.</P>
    <P>Major expansions and recruitment campaigns are being undertaken in Fingal by IBM, Symantec, Bristol Myers Squibb/Swords Laboratories <Col N="1215" /> with a £300 million investment programme currently being implemented at both Blanchardstown and Swords. Companies such as Celestica, 3 Com, Sanmina, Benchmark Electronics, Teradyne and Lucent Technologies are all recruiting. The IDA is developing a 250 acre college technology park in Blanchardstown in conjunction with Fingal County Council. This is the location for the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Other IDA developments in North Dublin outside the Fingal area, mostly at Clonshaugh Industrial Estate, include a 463 job expansion for Solectron which was approved in April and a 145 job expansion at a job global centre start-up at Clonshaugh. Each of these data centres involve an average investment of £30 million.</P>
    <P>Intel in Leixlip is also recruiting for its Fab 24 plant in which it hopes to employ an additional 1,000 people. The overseas ICT sector in Ireland includes many of the world's leading companies, producing systems hardware and software. The total number of companies is close to 300 and direct employment is approximately 50,000. Employment has shown substantial growth in 2000 with close to 7,000 new jobs having been created. A number of firms have experienced shortages of labour during the year, although an active programme of new educational courses is expected to remedy this situation in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>The sector includes many industry leaders in such sectors as semi-conductor designs and fabrications, computer systems and software and telecommunication systems. The activities carried on by these companies in Ireland have become much more diverse in the last number of years, taking advantage of Ireland's strengths in technology, education and broadband connectivity. These activities include manufacturing, software development, e-business, shared services and Internet and voice based technical support and sales, licensing management and research and development.</P>
    <P>Overall, the sector is expected to grow substantially over the next few years, driven by the increasing pervasiveness of e-business and mobile communications. It will, however, continue to change, one trend being that of primary producers continuing to outsource some core activities to third party contract manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The IDA has an active programme of encouraging Irish based companies to add additional high value functions to their Irish operations which will give them the ability to respond to changing market conditions. FÁS staff in the Dublin North region have been in touch with Motorola to offer assistance which will enable employees to find alternative suitable employment. The local Jobs Connect contact centre in Baldoyle and the employment office in Swords are available to meet all the staff who are affected by the redundancies and this offer was confirmed to the company's human resource department yesterday evening. The human resource depart<Col N="1216" /> ment has indicated that it will be in touch with FÁS when a clearer picture emerges of the people who are unsuccessful in securing employment with Celestica.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to establish a task force in Swords as a result of the proposed redundancies but I will meet with workers' representatives and any other local interest groups in regard to this matter. FÁS and the Local Employment Service will offer assistance to workers who are made redundant. I discussed the proposed redundancy package with the company and while a redundancy package can never be described as generous because people would rather have their jobs, the company intends to offer a very reasonable package.</P>
    <P>Motorola has had some very disappointing results in the past year. The anticipated growth in the mobile phone business has not materialised; in fact the market is down by about 20% and the company lost substantial market share to Nokia, one of its main competitors. That is why the company is involved in global restructuring.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the quality of employment provided by Motorola in Ireland. I had an opportunity to visit the Motorola headquarters in the United States on two occasions during the past three years. They are exemplary employers. I am disappointed to hear the comments of Deputies regarding the method in which the message was communicated to workers. When they told me at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, they said it was their intention to communicate with the work force the next morning and then make a public announcement.</P>
    <P>It is right that employees should hear from their employers that they will lose their jobs and not hear it on the airwaves as, unfortunately, so many employees have done in the past. If that did not happen in this case for some reason, I regret it but I am certain it was an oversight rather than the intention. The clear intention on Tuesday was to inform all the employees before any public statement was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me raise this matter and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for attending in person to deal with it. This is an important matter not just in my constituency but throughout rural areas and perhaps in the cities but I do not have evidence on the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the Minister adopted a hands off approach. Rural Garda stations are being closed by stealth as manpower falls to most unsatisfactory levels. The Minister and top Garda management are systematically and deliberately reducing Garda manpower levels. Figures for the midlands that I collated show a dramatic reduction in numbers over a ten year period. This is totally unacceptable. I look forward to the Minister confirming the future viability of rural <Col N="1217" /> Garda stations with particular reference to the issues I raise.</P>
    <P>Week after week at district courts, sitting judges express alarm and dissatisfaction at the number of people appearing before them on public order offences and general vandalism. They are angry. The situation is very serious and the Garda are not operating at full complement. In Laois-Offaly, cutbacks at larger stations such as Tullamore and Portlaoise reflect the serious depletion in numbers. In rural areas, Garda manpower levels have been reduced by 66 and two thirds per cent in many cases over a period of ten years or less. In Rhode in County Offaly there was one sergeant in 1990 and two gardaí, now there is one garda at the station for the few hours it is open. In Borris-in-Ossory there was one sergeant and two gardaí, now there is one garda. In Arless in 1990 there was one sergeant and two gardaí, ten years later there is a lone garda. In Durrow, a growing town on a very busy road, in 1990 there was one sergeant and two gardaí, now there is a sergeant and no garda. In Ballacolla, in 1990 there were two gardaí, now there is one. That trend is continued throughout Laois and Offaly. I am sure if I expressed the same interest in other constituencies, the figures would be similar.</P>
    <P>Added to that is the serious trend that has developed recently where, because of the depletion in numbers at larger stations such as Portlaoise and Tullamore &ndash; six have left Tullamore and seven have left Portlaoise &ndash; gardaí are drafted in from rural areas and towns such as Portarlington, Mountmellick, Edenderry and Mountrath to help maintain public order in Tullamore and Portlaoise. They are asked to engage in out of area duties in places where they do not know the people. It is most unfair to expect them to engage in the type of activity to which they are best suited in towns of which they have no knowledge and where they are not known.</P>
    <P>In Portarlington recently, the Garda car and gardaí were commandeered by whoever is in charge in the Phoenix Park depot and told they and the car were to spend the night in Portlaoise which meant there was no garda in Portarlington on a busy weekend night. In Mountmellick the position is such that there was a lone garda in a patrol car on duty all night. That was the sole Garda representation in a town that is experiencing considerable growth. I thought that, as far as gardaí were concerned, the practice of having one garda alone at night on foot patrol or in a car had been discontinued. I was surprised to learn that is still the practice. It is wrong that a single garda should be left alone on duty at night in large towns such as Portarlington, Edenderry, Mountmellick and Mountrath.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take action and ensure the type of Garda cover the people demand as being appropriate is made available.</P>

The provision for next year is more than £680 million, nearly a 50% increase. I am sure the Deputy will agree that this clearly illustrates my commitment, and that of the Government, to ensuring that the Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to tackle crime in all its forms. Never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme &ndash; Portlaoise was one of the places to benefit &ndash; to ensure that those guilty of serious offences serve their sentences.</P>

      <P>It is not unusual for areas to seek increased Garda personnel and resources in view of their effectiveness in tackling crime and providing a deterrent against would-be criminals. This is understandable and reflects the importance people attach to the visible presence of gardaí on the streets. While it is my responsibility to provide these resources in so far as it is practicable to do so, it is the Garda authorities who are primarily responsible for their detailed allocation to individual areas.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the allocation of Garda personnel and resources to an individual area is carried out with due regard to a number of factors in the various Garda districts throughout the country. The following factors have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of Garda personnel resources: population, geographical area, crimes reported per annum, number of road traffic accidents involving personal injury, number of stolen cars received and depreciation indicators. While these factors have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of personnel, different Garda districts have differing attendant sources of these variables and it is the overall balance of these, and not individual indicators taken in isolation, which prescribe the recommended allocation of available resources.</P>

      <Col N="1219" /> I am advised by the Garda authorities that the current personnel strength of Laois Offaly division is 274, all ranks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 1,094 offences were reported for the first ten months of this year with 501 being detected. The average detection rate over the period 1996-2000 is almost 49%. On a national basis, in 1996 more than 100,000 indictable offences were recorded. By 1999, this figure had fallen to 81,274. This represents a drop of nearly 20% over the four year period in question. Compared to 1998, crime fell by 5% in 1999. This <Col N="1220" /> ongoing and sustained downward trend in crime is to be welcomed by all.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased that the national detection rate for the year was 42% and while it was a slight decrease on 1998 it must be stressed that it has remained consistently high, over 40%, in recent years. This compares favourably with the detection rates in the US and Europe generally. While it is to be welcomed that the figures for 1999 show that crime levels are at their lowest for 20 years, there is no room for complacency. In this context, from time to time, particular forms of criminal behaviour become the source of real and understandable public concern. I am advised by the Garda authorities that a Garda operation is in existence in major centres throughout the Laois-Offaly division to prevent public order problems from arising.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that Garda management is satisfied that the current personnel strength in the Laois-Offaly division is adequate in meeting the policing needs of the area. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the policing situation in the Laois-Offaly division is monitored constantly and that the needs of the division will be considered in conjunction with all divisions when resources next become available.</P>
      <P>I will certainly bring Deputy Flanagan's comments to the attention of the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The VHI informed my Department on 31 October 2000 of its proposal to increase premiums by 5.5% with effect from 1 January 2001.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, the VHI chairman has brought to my attention the broad range of considerations which inform decisions on the revision of premium charges, such as increasing consumption of healthcare by members, new technologies and pay awards. Other factors bearing on this matter include projected financial performance, commercial considerations relating to the board's business planning, and cost control. The chairman has also made me aware of the need for a premium increase in the context of the board being in a position to continue to offer full and comprehensive levels of service to members.</P>
      <P>I have informed VHI that I wish to defer a final decision on the increase as proposed and I have suggested that discussions on the matter be entered into between VHI management and my Department. Early discussions are planned with a view to moving forward further consideration of the board's requirements for a premium increase.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to nursing home development <i>vis-à-vis</i> private health insurance, is that long-term nursing care, which incorporates most of the business of nursing homes, does not come within the ambit of such insurance. Private health insurance does, however, provide cover in respect of the cost of convalescent care arising from hospital in-patient treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the Deputy's question, inquiries have been made of VHI concerning its approach to nursing home coverage. The VHI has advised that it carried out a review of convalescent care in 1997. It was decided at the time that VHI would establish a new directory of convalescent homes and that all health board registered nursing homes should be invited to apply for inclusion in the directory. The VHI's criteria and procedures for selection were accordingly notified to all health board registered nursing homes in the country in November 1998. The criteria included evidence of current registration with a health board and having certain facilities at the home capable of being inspected at the date of the application. The selection process was open to all interested health board registered homes. It was <Col N="1223" /> decided that the directory would run for a three year period after which the process would start again and VHI would open up the process to all new and existing nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The VHI confirmed that during the course of their early research they discovered that convalescent benefit accounted for only 3% of nursing homes income nationally and that 97% of nursing home income arose from long-term and respite care. The VHI advised that there are 118 nursing homes currently approved to provide convalescent care to VHI members. They are confident that these homes can provide the required services that their members are seeking and they will review their requirements for additional nursing homes prior to the expiratory date of the current directory.</P>
    <P>Under the regulatory framework insurers are entitled to choose which providers shall provide services on behalf of their members. It would clearly be unsustainable and uneconomic to expect any insurer to cover all service providers. In this context, it is not considered that a conflict arises between the provision of tax relief incentives for new nursing homes and the coverage of such homes by insurers. It is recognised that insurers must be free to determine what facilities they are in a position to cover by reference to the needs of their members and the financial implications of same for their business.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to a review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings. The bed review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. In this regard my Department has received a detailed submission from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the content of which has already been the subject of discussion with the IHCA. I presented the interim findings of the national bed review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. One of the key issues identified during phase 1 of the review was the need for additional step-down facilities for patients who are currently inappropriately occupying acute hospital beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that funding of £25 million has now been provided on foot of the review to alleviate anticipated service pressures on the <Col N="1224" /> acute hospital sector. One element of the initiative is the contracting of at least 500 additional private nursing home beds by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. The ERHA and the health boards are in the process of contracting these beds at present. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these places will be additional to the number of private nursing home places currently subvented or contracted by the ERHA and the health boards. I am satisfied that this part of the package will have a significant impact on the problem of inappropriate use of acute hospital beds, with the immediate provision of additional bed capacity in a more appropriate setting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently a wide range of structures in place to monitor and evaluate productivity throughout the health sector at national and health board levels. These structures include a variety of mechanisms such as health strategies, programme expenditure reviews, service plans with performance indicators and audits by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The delivery of health care service is under continuous review and evaluation through a variety of mechanisms by my Department. One such mechanism is the casemix programme. The hospital in-patient enquiry, whereby public hospitals record and report on their activity levels, together with the specialty costs programme, form the basis for the casemix programme which now operates in over 30 hospitals and which continues to grow. The purpose of casemix is to assist hospitals to define their products, measure their productivity, and assess quality. Services cannot be planned and managed without knowing who the customers are, what they want and what the cost of providing such services is. Casemix is one of the best management tools available for monitoring and evaluation of services.</P>
      <P>The collection of relevant, accurate and timely information is critical to assessing productivity in the health sector. There is an ongoing development of information communications technology aimed at enhancing delivery and cost effectiveness through integrated care processes. These developments are contributing to the efficiency of service provision and the provision of better management information to assist in the pursuit of further cost effectiveness. The national development plan provides for increased investment and development of these systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to realise the full potential of the information being collected throughout the health sector, systems and processes need to be in place to ensure that it is utilised for planning and accountability purposes. Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, health boards are required to submit an annual service plan to <Col N="1225" /> my Department setting out the level of service that they will deliver for the financial determination they have received. The service planning discipline and structures now in place in health agencies and the ongoing developments in this area continue to enhance the delivery of health care services. Service plans are not just about financial accountability in the narrow sense but also provide an opportunity to show how we are progressing towards our goals.</P>
    <P>Health is a very expensive commodity, and it is incumbent on my Department to ensure the best possible use of public funds in the pursuit of health and social gain. An important ingredient in health care costs are the materials and supplies which are required in the operation of the health care system. The healthcare materials management board was established to ensure that the strategies outlined in the report of the materials management advisory group are implemented in the most effective and practical manner. This structure aims to guide health agencies in adopting best practice in this area to ensure that value for money is being achieved in each agency and through the combined purchasing power of all the health agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of 25 March 1997 approved proposals for a process of expenditure reviews aimed at providing a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and providing a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes. Reviews of the intellectual disability programme and the dental treatment services scheme have been completed. A review of the nursing home subvention expenditure scheme commenced in March 2000 and is scheduled to be completed by December 2000.</P>
    <P>In looking to future development in this area, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the value for money audit of the health services currently under way. Following on from the Government's review of its An Action Programme for the Millennium, consultants were appointed to carry out a comprehensive VFM audit of the health services. The VFM audit is looking back on the provision of health services over the past ten years so as to examine, among other things, trends in demand, resource inputs and outputs and differentials across health boards and hospitals over the last ten years. The study is expected to be completed by spring 2001.</P>
    <P>Currently under way also is the preparation of a new health strategy that will set out how we see the health services developing over the next five to seven years. It will set out our new health goals and how we intend to pursue them. The strategy will have regard to the need for an effective and productive health care system that is patient centred.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a charter of rights for hospital patients was introduced in August 1992. The charter provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis in law, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patients and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the implementation of the standards specified in the patients' charter is a matter for individual hospital management in the first instance. My Department places a high emphasis on the need for ongoing review of compliance with its terms and is in frequent contact with the service deliverers on issues which arise. The development of other mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy underpin my objective in providing a patient focused service within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality care based on clinical need. The patients' charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients rights and it is my intention to ensure that service providers continue to build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>
      <P>I am currently working with the health board chief executive officers on a framework for patient advocacy initiatives which is aimed at firmly establishing the primacy of the patient throughout all aspects of the health service including the acute hospital sector.</P>

Agreement has been reached with regard to the principles and approaches to be adopted in relation to the main service, training, research and career issues affecting medical staff. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This will require an increase in the present number of hospital consultant posts and significant change in the way hospitals work. The next step should be an assessment of the effect of the changes being recommended. This will involve a representative number of hospitals and will estimate, in a preliminary way, the extent of the resources required.</P>

These research projects deal with diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, prevention and control of CJD-BSE. Ireland also participants in the European surveillance programme on CJD.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the CJD advisory group was established to advise the Minister for Health and Children on CJD-related matters including surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in relation to this disease and to provide advice on particular issues referred to the group from time to time by the Minister. The advisory group is comprised of experts <i>inter alia</i> in neurology, virology, neuropathology, food safety, haematology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology. The group is chaired by Professor William Hall, head of the virus reference laboratory in UCD.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for a person aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement which was to be introduced over a three year period began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines increased by one-third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and it was intended that the third stage would be implemented in March 2001. However, this has been overtaken by the announcement in the budget yesterday that all persons aged 70 or over will be entitled to a medical card.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the health board chief executive officers are undertaking a review of the medical card scheme that involves consultation with the social partners in keeping with a commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I understand that the chief executive officers will be taking account of the review to date when revising the income guidelines next January. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): As the Deputy is aware a review of bed capacity has been initiated in both the acute and non-acute settings, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues as part of the estimates discussions and I identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties. I am pleased to say that funding of £25 million has been approved on foot of phase one of the review to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>The investment package is being targeted at a number of key service areas and includes the provision of funding for the contracting of at least 500 additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, together with the provision of aids and supports for older people. The ERHA and the health boards are in the process of contracting the nursing home beds at present. I am advised by the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority that the number of beds allocated to date is 375.</P>
    <P>Another key element of the initiative is the recruitment of an additional twenty-seven accident and emergency consultants and fifteen consultant anaesthetists. Due to the long lead-in time involved in appointing consultants, I have requested that these posts be filled as a matter of urgency, and initially on a temporary basis. The decision to fund the development of these two key services is being advanced in discussion with Comhairle na nOispidéal, as the body with statutory responsibility for structuring consultant posts. The matter will be considered at a meeting of Comhairle na nOispidéal on 15 December.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the national bed review is now under way and involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical speciality.</P>

      <P>The health boards outside of Dublin indicate that they are generally able to recruit staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of nursing vacancies of 30 September 2000 was carried out by the health service employers' agency. Employers were asked how many nurses they recruited in the year ending 30 September 2000 and how many nurses resigned or retired in the same period. In the voluntary <Col N="1230" /> hospital sector, a total of 1,284 nurses were recruited and a total of 1,334.5 nurses resigned or retired. For purposes of analysis, cases where temporary contracts have been completed would fall under resignation or retirement. In the health board sector outside Dublin recruitment runs strongly ahead of numbers leaving. Accordingly, in national terms, the numbers recruited exceed those resigning or retiring. It should also be noted that recruitment of personnel is carried out on an ongoing basis in most agencies, and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of personnel would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
    <P>As part of the same survey, employers were asked how many nurses they recruited from abroad during the year 30 September 1999 to 30 September 2000. The total number was reported as 336. Additional information provided indicated that while several employers had successfully recruited abroad the individuals involved had not yet commenced work or were awaiting clearance by An Bord Altranais. The full impact of recruitment campaigns is, thus, not reflected in the report. However, I understand that these nurses are now beginning to come on stream. The level of vacancies in Beaumont Hospital, for example, has halved since the survey was carried out.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that some health boards have been actively trying to recruit junior hospital doctors from various countries and have been attending medical employment fairs to encourage junior hospital doctors to work here in Ireland. A delegation recently visited India and Pakistan to recruit a small number of doctors in anaesthetics into training posts in Ireland, and to promote Ireland as a destination for further training for doctors who are seeking to improve their training. As a result, 59 candidates have been offered positions in Ireland. Arrangements are being put in place so that these doctors will be able to fill the posts early in 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the levels of attendances at accident and emergency departments, particularly those in the eastern region, are complex and cannot be predicted accurately in advance. In this regard periods of exceptional demand may be experienced and waiting periods for treatment may vary. This is particularly the case during the winter period. However, every effort is being made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum and I want to assure the Deputy that patients receive appropriate medical treatment at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept that a chaotic state obtains in <Col N="1231" /> many of our accident and emergency departments. My Department is committed to ensuring that they are in a position to respond to the need for their services particularly during periods of peak demand. Specific additional funding has been targeted at accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals providing such services, mainly in the eastern region, aimed at enhancing services. This additional funding, which amounted to £2 million in 1998, £2.3 million in 1999 and a further £2 million in the current year, was used to fund measures to free up beds for emergency admissions, for enhanced staffing levels, for the continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and for improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion, amongst other measures. Part of this additional funding is used to fund a public education campaign aimed at increasing public awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments with a particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department in an acute hospital.</P>
    <P>I also recognise that the development and enhancement of hospital accident and emergency departments is vital if we are to attain an efficient quality service, and examples of this include the development of the accident and emergency departments at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Cork University Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital which have been approved by my Department as part of overall developments at these hospitals. These projects will begin construction in 2001. In addition, a major proposal for the expansion of the existing accident and emergency department at St. James's Hospital has also recently been approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, pressures on accident and emergency services are felt most acutely in the eastern region and the improvement of these services has already been identified as a priority matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It has established a dedicated team to review accident and emergency services in the eastern region as a whole. From this review the authority intends to put forward a comprehensive policy for accident and emergency services which it expects will overcome many of the problems currently experienced in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The authority will be seeking to redress any imbalance in emergency care in terms of access, timeliness, appropriateness, and quality. In particular, the review will examine issues such as the physical and human resource requirements to reduce waiting times for treatment and admission in accident and emergency departments. The review will also seek to improve emergency access to treatment through a detailed examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It will also consider the provision of alternative care options for persons presenting with minor injuries. These options will <Col N="1232" /> include general practitioner &ldquo;out of hours&rdquo; services in community or hospital settings.</P>
    <P>For patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients requiring admission to the hospital, particularly those in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>In order to respond to this I recently announced a £25 million investment package which is aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period. The investment package is being targeted at a number of key service areas which includes a proposal to recruit an additional 25 accident and emergency consultants and an additional 15 consultant anaesthetists. Also included is the provision of funding for the contracting of at least 500 additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the health boards. The ERHA and the health boards are in the process of contracting these beds at present. I am satisfied that this part of the initiative will have a significant impact on the problem of inappropriate use of acute hospital beds with immediate consequential benefits to accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has maintained a sexual health and safe sex awareness programme for a number of years. This programme involves the display of &ldquo;safe sex&rdquo; messages in the toilet areas of places of entertainment such as pubs, youth clubs, etc. The Think Twice Every Time campaign which I launched recently is targeted at men and women in the 28 to 35 year old age group. The aim of the Think Twice Every Time campaign is to help to educate, inform and empower people about their relationships and their sexuality. The principal message of the campaign is that both partners are responsible for their own and each other's sexual health. In particular, both partners must take responsibility for preventing unwanted pregnancy and avoiding sexually-transmitted infection. The campaign will seek to raise awareness about a range of issues including the fertility of the body, how pregnancy occurs, the safe and correct use of contraception, the prevention of sexually trans<Col N="1233" /> mitted infection and the effect alcohol can have in relation to decision making and risk taking.</P>
    <P>The campaign will involve a number of focused initiatives, including regional workshops, a poster campaign and a public information booklet. It is envisaged that the campaign, which has an annual budget of £400,000, will run for an initial period of twelve months. The campaign will be implemented in partnership with the health boards, other statutory and non-statutory bodies and a variety of interest groups.</P>
    <P>This campaign complements the national relationships and sexuality education programme and the social, personal and health education programme within schools which provide opportunities for pupils to learn basic personal and social skills which foster integrity and self-esteem while nurturing self-confidence and sensitivity to the rights of others. My Department is committed to working in partnership with the Department of Education and Science over the coming years to support the implementation of SPHE, of which RSE is an integral part. In addition, the national youth health programme, also funded through my Department and the Department of Education and Science, offers training for the youth sector in the area of sexual health promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in recent times hospitals providing accident and emergency services, including Beaumont Hospital, have experienced some increased activity. However, it is important to note that while patients may experience delays in accident and emergency departments, appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority assumed responsibility for all health service issues in the eastern region from 1 March, 2000. I have made inquiries of the regional chief executive and have been advised that the accident and emergency service in Beaumont Hospital has recently experienced some additional pressure. While overall activity in the A&amp;E department for the year to date is marginally down on last year, nevertheless this year the hospital has experienced an increase of 10% in the number of emergency admissions and new attendances by ambulance rose by 7%. This was against a background where the hospital had to close 64 beds due to the shortage of nursing staff. After a successful recruitment campaign in the Philippines and the graduation of student nurses, the hospital has appointed 57 extra nurses which will allow the hospital to open all beds by next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition and in order to build on the success of such recruitment campaigns, I have recently announced details of a £5 million package of <Col N="1234" /> incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas, including accident and emergency.</P>
    <P>The ERHA has been engaged in a review of A&amp;E services for the eastern region. The purpose of this review is to develop a comprehensive policy on A&amp;E services. Beaumont Hospital is represented on the review by its A&amp;E consultant. In light of this review, Beaumont Hospital is working closely with the medical and nursing staff to implement a number of short-term measures to help alleviate the situation. These include improved efficiencies in discharge processes to allow patients to be admitted to a ward from A&amp;E as early as possible, the conversion of a five-day elective ward to a seven-day ward for A&amp;E patients and the transfer of patients awaiting discharge and placement to step-down convalescent facilities to a low intensity area in the hospital, requiring minimal nursing and medical care.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have already been planned for introduction at the hospital over the coming months including the opening of a new cardiac catheterisation laboratory in the next two weeks. This will reduce the waiting periods for angiograms for in-patients; increasing the TIA, trans ischaemic attack, clinic from two days to five days per week; opening of a new asthma clinic; and opening of a new chest pain clinic.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, Beaumont Hospital, as part of the accident and emergency initiative, received in 1998 an additional £200,000 of which £170,000 was used to employ additional nurses and £30,000 for medical staff and in 1999 received an additional £200,000 in capital specifically for revamping the accident and emergency department. The final cost of this project was £300,000; and in 2000 an additional £240,000 was allocated to replace and increase the equipment levels in the A&amp;E department.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the authority's winter bed initiative which is aimed at providing an allocation of step-down and convalescent beds for patients being discharged from acute hospitals. Funding has been allocated for a total of 495 beds for the eastern region for the winter initiative, of which 240 beds have already been contracted. Beaumont Hospital will have appropriate access to these beds to alleviate the problems of admissions.</P>
    <P>As part of a £25 million package of investment which I announced recently to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector nationally, it is proposed to appoint an additional 27 consultants to work in accident and emergency hospitals. One of these posts is planned for Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The hospital is also reviewing a number of its policies, including the transfer of patients from other health board areas and the admission of patients through the out-patients department. Continuing efforts are being made to improve the discharge planning process and the hospital has appointed three bed co-ordinators in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> The local and national initiatives which I have outlined above should impact positively in reducing waiting times in the accident and emergency department at Beaumont and other major A&amp;E departments.</P>
    <P>Local discussions between management and staff at the hospital are ongoing to address the issues in question and I would hope that the matter can be resolved quickly by this process in the interests of both patients and staff.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to the introduction of a free general practitioner service for the population as a whole.</P>
      <P>The present philosophy and structure of the medical card scheme which provides, among other benefits, such a service to medical card holders is designed to allow public resources to be targeted at those in greatest need. That has been the case from the inception of the scheme in 1972 and all Governments since that time have been satisfied that this represents the most appropriate approach. Accordingly, I am not considering, at this time, the introduction of a universal free general practitioner service. However, as the Deputy will be aware from yesterday's budget speech by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the Government has decided to provide for automatic medical card entitlement for all persons aged 70 and over.</P>
      <P>On the basis of existing figures relating to the present coverage of the medical card scheme and related fees and allowances paid to general practitioners, it is estimated that the cost in a full year of a universal free general practitioner service would, conservatively, be in the region of £450 million.</P>

    <P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care provided by health boards and the service has been expanded and developed over the last decade in line with general developments in the child protection and welfare service. Increase in demand over this period has also led to increasing pressure on the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> Included in the budget yesterday is an increase of £9 million, £17 million full year costs, for a restructuring of foster care payments and general strengthening of foster care services. The discretionary payments to foster care will be abolished and the level of weekly allowances will be greatly enhanced. These changes are based on the recommendations of the working group on foster care whose report will be published in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the current position in relation to the breast cancer services at Mayo General Hospital, following the recent meeting with interested parties from Mayo who highlighted their concern at the possible downgrading of facilities arising from the report of the sub group of the national cancer forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the request of my predecessor, the national cancer forum was asked to review symptomatic breast cancer services. A sub-group of the forum carried out this review. The sub-group had the following terms of reference: to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
      <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy; medical oncology; counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought regarding how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the <Col N="1238" /> best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>I have received the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. No final decisions regarding implementation arrangements at health board level have been taken. I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group has met with Western Health Board officials and clinicians. I understand that the Western Health Board is currently considering how best to develop breast disease services in its area and the board will submit a plan for the development of this service when complete.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to downgrade the service or facilities currently available in Mayo General Hospital. I intend to work with the Western Health Board in ensuring a comprehensive and coherent regionalised approach to the development of services for symptomatic breast disease in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The next meeting of the Council of Health Ministers will take place in Brussels on 14 December. The main action items on the agenda are two draft resolutions for adoption, one on nutrition and one on paediatric medicines.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution on nutrition points to the importance of nutrition as a health determinant and calls for action particularly in improving nutrition information to consumers.</P>
      <P>The second draft resolution highlights the need for special attention to be given to encouraging specific evaluation of medicines for paediatric use in order to avoid the dangers inherent in the present situation where most medicines prescribed for children have been evaluated for adult use only.</P>
      <P>Ministers will debate the proposal for a decision of the Parliament and Council adopting a programme of community action in the field of public health. This proposal was presented by the Commission to the Council at its last meeting on 29 June and has been under consideration during the French Presidency in the relevant Parliament and Council working groups. The Council may not, however, be in a position to adopt its common position on the proposal under the codecision procedure on 14 December as the Parliament may not have furnished its option by that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three tobacco-related issues for the Council agenda. The Commission intends to advise the Council of its proposal for a new draft directive on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products. Deputies will be aware that the 1998 directive was annulled by the European <Col N="1239" /> Court of Justice in October on the grounds that the articles of the Treaty used as the legal base were inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Commission will provide a status report on the draft directive on manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. This proposed directive recasts two existing directives on the tar yields of cigarettes and the labelling of tobacco products and seeks to update and supplement those provisions in the light of experience and scientific developments. The Council adopted its common position on the draft in July and Parliament is currently engaged in its second reading, the outcome of which is expected on 11 December. The Council and Parliament positions on the measure are close and I think we can look forward to early adoption of the draft directive.</P>
    <P>The Council will receive information from the Commission on the state of its negotiations on a World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control. The convention is likely to be a legally binding treaty to which each WHO member state can readily and independently accede. Many of the issues envisaged for protocols to the convention &ndash; for example, smuggling and advertising &ndash; are already within the competence of the EU Commission and the European Union was accordingly granted a negotiating mandate. The EU strategy is to strongly support the convention keeping the Community position as flexible as possible while seeking the strongest possible text.</P>
    <P>The Health Ministers will hear from the Commission on the latest situation with regard to BSE and the epidemiological situation of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and will exchange views on these matters.</P>

      <P>A major factor affecting the ability of hospitals to provide beds for patients over the winter period is the high number of acute beds which are inappropriately occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their illness. Many of these patients are in the older age category and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Part of the initiative which I recently announced aimed at alleviating critical service pressures in acute hospitals, provides for the contracting of at least 500 additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. The ERHA and the health boards are in the process of contracting these beds at present. I am satisfied that this part of the initiative will have a significant impact on the problem of inappropriate use of acute hospital beds with the immediate provision of additional bed capacity in a more appropriate setting.</P>

      <P>A nurse coming to work here under the working visa arrangement is entitled to work anywhere as a nurse in the country. Nurses from abroad enjoy similar conditions to Irish nurses, and, like Irish nurses, many undertake agency work if they so wish. This, of course, is without prejudice to any contractual arrangement which an individual nurse may have entered into with a particular health service employer.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons for nurses opting for agency work is the lack of flexible working arrangements available at present. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service will come into operation on 1 February next. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis. A primary objective is to facilitate the retention of nursing staff for whom full-time work is not a realistic option. It is also hoped that the introduction of more flexible working arrangements will encourage nurses and midwives who have left the public health service, including those undertaking agency work, to come back into the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 60 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I have long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the dental health action plan to be achieved. However, it will be some time before the structural changes now being introduced can impact significantly on service levels. Accordingly, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that funds for an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists have been provided by the Government in the current budget. A total of £3.7 million is being provided on an ongoing basis. This additional funding will enable health boards to recruit additional staff to provide orthodontic treatment; provide additional sessions for existing staff; make additional arrangements for the provision of treatment by private orthodontists at approved rates.</P>
      <P>Based on the health boards' own submissions I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The ultimate effect of this initiative will be to increase numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum. This initiative, when fully on stream and together with structural changes being introduced in the orthodontic service should make it possible for a number of boards to eventually reduce waiting times for treatment to one year. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out as part of this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am providing a total of £1.610 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority on an ongoing basis under this initiative for the employment of a locum consultant orthodontist; the recruitment of two additional orthodontists on a <Col N="1242" /> permanent basis; the appointment of six community orthodontists, two in each area health board; contracting of services from private orthodontists at approved rates; recruitment of three clinicians with M. Orth. qualifications to fill existing vacancies in the regional orthodontic unit at St. James's; recruitment of 12 nursing and nine administrative support staff for the additional clinicians as outlined above; the commissioning of five additional surgeries at St. James's Hospital which will come on stream early in 2001; new regional orthodontic units are also being established at Beaumont and Loughlinstown, the unit at Loughlinstown is expected to be operational early in January next.</P>
    <P>The authority is also pressing ahead with organisational changes in the orthodontic services. Orthodontics will be managed and operated in the region on the basis of three services, one in each area health board.</P>
    <P>I am providing £0.813 million to the Southern Health Board on an ongoing basis under this initiative for the recruitment of additional orthodontists and for additional dental teams and support staff at the Cork and Kerry units.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is confident that significant improvements in service levels and waiting times will result from these developments.</P>

Ireland welcomes this initiative and supports the adoption of the EU resolution to promote wider options to ensure that <Col N="1244" /> new medicinal products for children and products already on the market are fully adapted to the specific needs of children. The resolution also recognises that any such developments would have to take into account internationally acknowledged standards for the protection of minors with regard to medical scientific research.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the report Activities of Irish Psychiatric Services, 1999, which found that non-voluntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals here are much higher than in other EU countries; the action he will take on foot of these findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report entitled Activities of Irish Psychiatric Services, 1999, published recently by the Health Research Board, notes that 11% of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 1999 were involuntary admissions. This represented a rate for involuntary admissions in Ireland of 75.3 per 100,000 of total population, compared with a rate of 49 per 100,000 in England and Wales and 26 per 100,000 in Italy.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas, will modernise Irish law in relation to involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. The Bill provides for the establishment of an independent agency to be known as the Mental Health Commission. Its primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected.</P>
      <P>The Bill further provides that each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the duration of such detention will have to be referred to the commission, which will arrange for an independent review of the decision by a mental health tribunal. The tribunal will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist. The tribunal will also be empowered to order the release of the patient if it considers that he or she does not require to be detained.</P>
      <P>It is expected that, when implemented, the provisions of the Mental Health Bill will bring about a reduction over time in the number of decisions to detain a person involuntarily and thus bring the rate for involuntary detention in this country closer to that pertaining in other European countries.</P>

      <P>The social services inspectorate, SSI, published its first report of findings relating to inspections of children's residential centres in October 2000.</P>
      <P>It was noted in the report that, in most centres, the majority of care posts were designated as assistant house parent, for which there is no specified professional qualification required.</P>
      <P>Although a substantial proportion of care staff do not have recognised qualifications for residential child care, it is encouraging to note that they do have between them a wide variety of other educational and vocational qualifications, which are undoubtedly useful to them in their work with children. The qualifications include degrees in subjects such as social science, psychology and social psychology as well as diplomas and certificates in counselling, child protection and welfare, youth and community work, sports leadership, applied social studies and a range of nursing qualifications including general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing.</P>
      <P>The expert group on various health professionals recommended &ldquo;that child care workers be accorded professional status and as a consequence recruitment of non-qualified personnel must eventually cease&rdquo;. In pursuance of this a joint committee has been established to deal with issues arising from the recognition of the autonomy of the child care profession including &ldquo;a complete review of the training available to child care workers, with a view to the introduction of nationally recognised professional qualification and provision of in service training&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the numbers of unqualified staff working in residential care. I have raised the issues highlighted in the report by the SSI with the chief executive officers of the health boards and have outlined to them my concerns in this area. The chief executive officers are in the process of establishing an implementation group to oversee the implementation of this and the other recommendations in the report and to ensure that best practice is widely disseminated.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department chairs a steering group of senior health board and SSI officials which oversees the development of the SSI and will monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the SSI.</P>

      <P>In fulfilment of a <Col N="1246" /> commitment in the EU White Paper on food safety, the European Commission published a draft directive on the approximation of the laws relating to food supplements in May 2000. There is a wide range of nutrients and other ingredients that might be present in food supplements, including, but not limited to, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibre and various plant and herbal extracts. As a first stage, the draft directive currently under discussion only deals with food supplements containing vitamins and minerals.</P>
      <P>To date, there have been four meetings of the EU working party of experts to discuss this draft directive. Officials from my Department, the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have attended these meetings.</P>
      <P>In developing a national position on this draft directive, my Department has met the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board and industry representatives, including the Irish Association of Health Stores. My Department has taken careful note of that association's views relating to the draft directive.</P>
      <P>I welcome this initiative for a legislative framework on food supplements and consider that the proposal is an overall balanced approach. There are still some issues in the draft directive that need to be resolved at European level and I look forward to the outcome of these discussions with interest.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that existing accountability legislation provides for varying elements of accountability for health board hospitals, joint board hospitals and voluntary hospitals all of whom receive capital and revenue funding from the Exchequer through my Department's vote. In acknowledging the need to improve and enhance existing good practices in this regard, my Department facilitated a governance initiative workshop in 1998 followed by a major conference organised by the Office for Health Management in June 1999.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards, chairperson and secretary managers of all the major voluntary paediatric and joint board hospitals were represented at the conference which produced a policy discussion document Governance and Hospital Boards. The document has been circulated to all the relevant agencies and provides a further impetus to the development of thinking on and action on a range of good governance issues. I am satisfied that the outcomes of this process will lead to improved governance arrangements for members of hospital boards, hospital executives and management and their staff in determining their respective functions and chains of accountability.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to establish a food inspectorate for public hospitals in this country. However, I am confident that the overall standard of food in Irish hospitals is satisfactory and that the issue of food standards in public hospitals is taken very seriously by hospital management. Both hospital management and staff exercise extreme vigilance and strive to maintain a high standard of food quality in their hospitals. Hospitals employ appropriately qualified and trained catering staff who are responsible for all meals provided. Furthermore, the major capital developments which have taken place in recent years on the design and redevelopment of many public hospitals have included modifications to kitchen and catering facilities which have been upgraded to the highest specifications.</P>
      <P>Where necessary, special nutrition and dietary requirements for patients are arranged by nutritionists and-or dieticians employed in hospitals who work in consultation with medical and nursing staff.</P>

      <P>The number of people at present waiting for hip operations in the Southern Health Board region is 100.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the overall numbers on waiting lists on 30 September 2000 fell by 7,198, which is a reduction of 19.5% on the end of the December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated this year to health agencies and £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This investment is being made in conjunction with longer term measures associated with the £2 <Col N="1252" /> billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative which I recently announced. In this regard, I was pleased to announce an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non-acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Under the winter initiative, at least 500 additional nursing home places will be contracted from private nursing homes. I am satisfied that this element of the initiative will increase the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of inappropriate use of hospital beds and will enhance the level of step down care available.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists.</P>

      <P>The health care of immigrants is addressed in the context of general arrangements governing eligibility for public health services. Entitlement to health services is primarily based on residency and means.</P>
      <P>In discharging its international obligations, my Department, through the health boards, provides for the health care of asylum seekers. The arrangements in place are not, however, subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders, while awaiting a decision on an application to remain in this country.</P>
      <P>The issue of health screening has arisen in relation to catering for the healthcare of asylum seekers. Health screening is available, on a voluntary basis, to all asylum seekers. Other issues relating to the health of asylum seekers are considered and addressed through the health boards in accordance with emerging needs.</P>

      <P>In this regard, I should add that I have very recently received the wide-ranging review of general practitioner services undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards. When I have considered that review, it is my intention to initiate comprehensive discussions with relevant representative organisations, including the Irish College of General Practitioners, on the future development of general practice, and, in that context, those consultations will also have regard to the joint ICGP/IMO paper on general practice development.</P>

      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to bringing Ireland into line with other EU-EEA states where such controls exist in one form or another; improving standards in existing pharmacies and promotion patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the free movement of pharmacists directive.</P>
      <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is proactive in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharma<Col N="1254" /> ceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which, <i>inter alia, </i>the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and also in the context of the new Pharmacy Bill which I indicated I would bring forward next autumn.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that Breast Check, the national breast screening programme, was formally launched on 10 October 2000 and it is being implemented on a planned phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase I of the programme is covering the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board area and is targeting 140,000 women in the age <Col N="1264" /> cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. The first mobile unit commenced screening on 21 August 200 in Longford and moved to the Navan area on 13 November 2000.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. Breast Check has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable and professionally advisable.</P>

      <P>Phase I of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women aged 25-60 years will <Col N="1265" /> be screened, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the programme to cover women outside the Mid-Western Health Board area, including those covered by the GMS, is currently under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the expert advisory group on cervical screening.</P>

      <P>The health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infection. Services for the treatment of sexually transmitted infection are available in a number of locations around the country. With increasing numbers of people presenting with a range of sexually transmitted infections, a priority for 2001 is the appointment of two new infectious diseases consultants in the Dublin area and one in the Western Health Board. Funding for these posts is being made available by my Department in 2001.</P>
      <P>Health boards also undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and among the issues addressed is the prevention of sexually transmitted inflection. Where appropriate, the health boards work in conjunction with voluntary organisations in this regard.</P>
      <P>At national level, the health promotion unit of my Department has maintained a sexual health and safe sex awareness programme for a number of years. This programme involves the display of safe sex messages in the toilet areas of places of entertainment frequented by young people, such as pubs and youth clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently launched a further public awareness campaign, entitled Think Twice Every Time, and this is targeted at men and women in the 18 to 35 year age group. The aim of this campaign is to help educate, inform and empower people about their relationships and their sexuality. The principal message of the campaign will be that both partners are responsible for their own and each other's sexual health. In particular, both partners must take responsibility for preventing unwanted pregnancy and avoiding sexually transmitted infection. The campaign will seek to raise awareness about such issues as the fertility of the body, how pregnancy occurs, the safe and correct use of <Col N="1266" /> contraception, the prevention of sexually transmitted infection and the effect alcohol can have in relation to decision making and risk taking.</P>
    <P>The campaign will involve a number of focused initiatives including regional workshops, a poster campaign and a public information booklet. It will be implemented in partnership with the health boards, other statutory and non-statutory bodies and a range of interest groups.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the director of the cancer register that the data currently collected is not sufficiently detailed to comment on areas with a county boundary which might appear to have a particular high incidence of the disease. The director stated that the over figure for County Kerry does not indicate a higher incidence when compared to the figures for other counties.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care of treatment of patients with cancer over the last number of years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996 and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their <Col N="1267" /> quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The national cancer forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. The main areas of development included that of consultant appointments. Some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme has commenced. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the national cancer forum. I have received the report of this group, which I am considering. I propose to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop symptomatic breast cancer services further.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work with the national cancer forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>The national alcohol policy was published by my Department in September 1996. It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. As alcohol problems are multi-dimensional the policy sets out multi-sectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies. Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place. The most significant of these are the national alcohol surveillance centre has been established; a national lifestyle survey has been carried out; an advertising campaign emphasising the message of moderation in drinking has been carried out and evaluated; research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected to be published early next year; a new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers will be launched in February next; and a training course has been developed <Col N="1268" /> in association with the drinks industry group and CERT on the responsible serving of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Work is also ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan, including developing the school curriculum to include a significant level of health related issues and policies which relate to alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced  and to make progress in relation to initiatives involving other Department. Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption and to look at the issue of under age drinking. Actions taken on the basis of the plan are evaluated on an ongoing basis so that the policy continues to be focused and effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend it to include Hungtinton's disease, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive office of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical care, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. Even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the LTI scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user-friendly <Col N="1269" /> and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern being expressed by pharmacists in regard to paracetamol are part of those concerns arising generally in relation to overdosages being encountered with the wide availability of this medicinal product.</P>
      <P>The current position in relation to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol, both in pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets, is based on the policy and recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board which are implemented by the board in the granting of product authorisations in respect of medicinal products to be placed or maintained on the market in this country. This board is the competent authority for the granting and renewal of the product authorisations under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulation, 1998. These authorisations set out the conditions subject to which medicinal products may be placed on the market. The primary aim is to promote public health by ensuring that medicinal products available to the public meet the required standards of safety, quality and efficacy in accordance with the obligation arising from current EU and national legislative requirements.</P>
      <P>Due to concerns arising from overdosages of paracetamol, in 1997 the Irish Medicines Board, following a request from my Department, drew up a series of recommendations in relation to the sale of paracetamol, including a recommendation to restrict the sale of paracetamol in non-pharmacy retail outlets to packs containing not more than 12 500 mg tablets or equivalent. Following extensive consultation almost all the manufacturers concerned have supported the recommendations and have agreed to conform with the board's recommendations with a view to implementing them in order to enhance public safety.</P>
      <P>Regulations to restrict the availability of paracetamol, which would give statutory effect to the recommendations made by the Irish Medicines Board, are currently under consideration in my Department. These recommendations relate to pack size and availability in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets and will, as already outlined, subject packs of paracetamol above particular pack sizes to pharmacy-only or prescription-only control as appropriate. I understand that most manufacturers are already operating within these guidelines in anticipation of the introduction of the new regulations.</P>

      <P>The case has been made by an organisation to my Department that military personnel, by virtue of the arrangements under which they can obtain healthcare as part of their employment, should be considered to have private health insurance contracts.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Insurance Act, 1994, a health insurance contract is deemed to be one which has as its sole or principal purpose the making of payments, by health benefits undertakings, specifically for the reimbursement or discharge of fees or charges in respect of hospital in-patient services or ancillary health services. The legislation requires providers of health insurance contracts to be formally registered as health benefits undertakings and obliges such undertakings to, <i>inter alia</i>, community rate their premiums. My Department considers that the sole or principal purpose of the existing arrangements for military personnel relates to employment and, in particular, to the capacity of personnel to fulfil their duties and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a change in the definition of a health insurance contract which, <i>inter alia</i>, will ensure that, going forward, arrangements by employers to meet the healthcare costs of their employees do not develop as a threat to community rating. It was recognised, however, that certain establishment health care arrangements, such as those for military personnel, should be facilitated and should not be subject to alteration as a result of the legislation. Consequently, the Bill makes allowance for the established arrangements for the provision of health services to military personnel to continue outside the health insurance regulatory framework. I consider that the appropriate course of action is being taken under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Phase 1 of the national cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board was launched in mid-October 2000. Since the programme started, the board has advised that work is proceeding according to plan. The following represents the progress to date.</P>
      <P>The programme is capturing opportunistic smears whereby women attend their GP for a free smear and the GPs who are registered and contracted to the programme are receiving payment. There are 213 GPs and 128 practice nurses registered with the programme to date. The training programme for smeartakers is due to commence next week. The distribution of free smear kits, disposal speculae, forms, literature display units and information packs to GPs has been completed.</P>
      <P>The phase 1 promotions officer has extended the information available on the programme's website. In addition, the information helpline, on-line registration and self-registration are being availed of by women in the region to assist in ensuring the accuracy of the baseline register of names, addresses and dates of birth of women in the target age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The computerised baseline register is in place <Col N="1274" /> for some time having been created from information based on the Health Provision of Information Act, 1997. Additional software tools for validation of name matching and addresses are used by staff. To maintain confidentiality, the personal public service number is used as a unique identifier.</P>
    <P>Given that the programme is in the early stage, it is crucial to proceed in a planned and structured way from the opportunistic manner of providing smears to the more organised approach of the programme policy. The programme's computer system is due for completion by March 2001 and in the interim an access database is in place. The call and recall system and linkages to the three laboratories and the colposcopy clinic for the first phase will be electronic with a two way transfer of information based on women's consent for this to happen.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance is the cornerstone of the programme and standards have been set for all areas which will enhance the development of all processes involved. A quality assurance manager for the programme is due to take up post shortly.</P>
    <P>Since the launch, the cytology laboratories at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, have been sending test notifications on smears received from the mid-west to the programme's office in Limerick. The test notification triggers the GP payment. At this stage, result files are also being received by the programme's office. Result letters are being sent to women by the programme's office. Women are being referred, as appropriate, to the colposcopy clinic in Limerick.</P>

      <P>The health board structure provides the framework for the delivery of health service administration. The existing organisational structures date back to the Health Act, 1970, which established eight health boards and defined their role in the provision of services. Each health board comprises elected local representatives, a small number of ministerial nominees and representatives of certain health professions employed by the board. Each board has its own chief executive officer who is answerable to his or her board. Health administration was further changed earlier this year with the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority which took over the functions of the Eastern Health Board on 1 March 2000. The purpose of the change was to reform organisational structures in the health services in the eastern region, Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, to improve the co-ordination and integration in the planning and delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing the <Col N="1277" /> best possible service to the people and continues to strive for excellence in the delivery of health care. While I currently have no plans for further reform of the existing structure, the service is under continuous review and evaluation by my Department, an example of which is the value for money audit currently under way. This VFM audit is being carried out under the Government's review of its Action Programme for the Millennium and is looking back on the provision of health services over the past ten years so as to examine, among other things, trends in demand, resource inputs and outputs and differentials across health boards and hospitals over the last ten years. The study is expected to be completed in spring 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working on the preparation of a new health strategy for publication in mid-2001. The strategy will address major issues facing the health services and how the health services may develop over a five to seven year timeframe.</P>

      <P>Non-consultant doctors &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; normal working hours are 39 per week. However, they often are rostered to work in excess of this. The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the EU Directive on Working Time. The Deputy will be aware that agreement was reached on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years allowed.</P>
      <P>As part of our preparations for this eventuality we have conducted a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study was undertaken at six hospitals by PA management consultants. The report of the study is expected to be completed shortly. In addition, the report of the medical manpower forum addresses the need to retain medical graduates in this country.</P>

      <P>The Government's national children's strategy, Our Children &ndash; Their Lives, was launched by the Taoiseach on 13 November, 2000. The national children's strategy maps out a plan to be implemented over the next ten years, which will provide a better way for everybody who is concerned with children's issues to work more effectively together for and with children. The strategy represents the strongest possible demonstration to date by any Government of its commitment to children through its support for parents, families and carers.</P>
      <P>Work in relation to implementing the strategy's proposals, which cut across a wide range of policy areas, has already commenced. The national children's office has already been established on an administrative basis and work is under way to establish the proposed national children's advisory council. In addition, tenders have been invited for a design brief for the national longitudinal study of children which forms part of the strategy's research proposals. Copies of the strategy are currently being circulated around the country by the office so that local groups can consider how they can contribute to its implementation. A communications programme to support the implantation of the strategy at local level is being developed and will be led by me as I have responsibility for implementing the strategy. With regard to the implementation of the more detailed aspects of the strategy, the intention is that the national children's office will be established on a statutory basis as quickly as possible. The office will develop an annual programme of work, in consultation with Government Departments and agencies, to advance the nationals goals and objectives contained in the strategy. This work will be completed in early 2001. This will be complemented by the inclusion of the measures to be taken by relevant Departments and agencies to advance the strategy's goals and objectives in their strategy statements and accompanying business plans.</P>

      <P>Stimulant drinks contain three active ingredients, caffeine, glucuronolactone and taurine. In 1999 the European Scientific Committee for Food, SCF, was asked by the European Commission for an opinion on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks. This committee, which carries out risk assessment on foodstuffs in Europe, reached a number of conclusions in its opinion. These were based on an assumed maximum intake level of 0.5 litre of energy drink per day. It concluded that the contribution of energy drinks to overall caffeine intake is not a matter of concern for non-pregnant adults. Moderation of caffeine intake, from whatever source, is advisable during pregnancy. Substitution of energy drinks for normal beverages by children could lead to increased caffeine levels in this group. This could result in transient behavioural changes such as arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety.</P>
      <P>The interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied. Nor has the interaction of caffeine and taurine with alcohol particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating. The safety-in-use of taurine and glucuronolactone as delivered in energy drinks has not been established. Further studies would be required.</P>
      <P>This opinion makes it clear that the scientific data was not available to answer all questions about the safety of these energy drinks under all circumstances of usage.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that energy drinks are on sale throughout the country, it is important that their safety is evaluated on a national level. I have, therefore, requested the Food Safety Promotion Board, FSPB, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, to commission independent scientific research into the effects of these stimulant energy drinks.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, which is responsible for the enforcement of food safety law in Ireland, is not aware of any proven links between the consumption of energy drinks and adverse health conditions.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving the scientific research on these energy drinks from the FSPB in due course.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the need for an effective safety regime for the fishing industry. Such a regime needs to incorporate not only formal training, but general safety awareness and education as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety training is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews and my Department has been working closely with BIM to ensure that new and more accessible training facilities are provided for fishermen. In 1996, when the fishing vessel safety review group reported there was only one training facility for the fishing sector, the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle in County Donegal. Since then, a second regional training centre has been opened in Castletownbere in 1999 and two mobile coastal training units have also been established. These units pro<Col N="1286" /> vide basic sea-survival and first aid courses in the fishing ports around the country. In addition, the mobile units have three small mobile trailers which can be towed to any part of the country and used for training purposes.</P>
    <P>BIM has produced An Integrated Training Plan for the Irish Seafood Industry 2000-2006 which will, <i>inter alia</i>, deliver a wide range of training courses to the catching sector with significant emphasis placed on safety training. It is worth noting that BIM's training budget for the fishing and aquaculture sector amounts to £10 million for the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of mandatory safety training for the fishing industry, there are a number of considerations to be taken into account. While this was a recommendation of the fishing vessel review group, at the time representatives of the fishing industry expressed strong reservations about this proposal. They argued that there was a serious shortage of well-trained deckhands and that fishing vessels rely heavily on casual labour, without whom some vessels could not put to sea. The situation in relation to the shortage of manpower for the industry has deteriorated since the FVSRG report in 1996 to such an extent that BIM are actively trying to recruit non-EU nationals for the fishing sector. The policy adopted by both BIM and my Department to date has been to provide high quality, easily accessible training facilities and to encourage the industry to avail of these opportunities.</P>
    <P>A major review of manpower requirements in the fishing industry is currently being finalised and will address among other things safety requirements. I intend to address as a matter of priority the question of mandatory safety training. I stress, however, that safety training is an integral part of the syllabus for fishing skipper and deckhand courses run by BIM.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission has <Col N="1288" /> already introduced a private storage aid scheme for cow beef with effect from 27 November to 2 February 2001 in order to alleviate the impact of the current market difficulties on farmers. In addition, the Commission has indicated that it intends to introduce a &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme under which beef from cattle over 30 months of age can be destroyed unless it has been tested for BSE. This should make a substantial contribution to market balance in the EU. The Commission has also undertaken to introduce flexible intervention and I am confident that an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which can provide the basis for a resumption of orderly marketing will be put in place at the beef management committee on 12 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government has also made every effort to ensure that all major markets remain open to Irish beef, particularly Egypt, which has suspended issuing import licences to EU traders. Senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt at the weekend for meetings with senior Egyptian officials. Ireland has an extremely positive case to make on BSE and these officials ensured that the Egyptian authorities were made fully aware of the controls we have in place. Furthermore, the Taoiseach has raised the matter with President Mubarak. He impressed upon him the full facts about Irish beef exports and asked him to avoid taking definitive action which may damage this trade.</P>
      <P>I also visited Egypt after the meeting of the Council earlier this week to meet the Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Wali. I impressed upon him the importance of the market to Ireland, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef and I also briefed him on the range of measures which will be put in place within the EU to deal with BSE which, I believe, will help restore consumer confidence and eliminate much of the confusion which has arisen out of the recent BSE scares. The meeting with Dr. Wali was very positive. Once the Egyptian authorities have completed their assessment of recent developments, I am confident that there will be an early resumption of the issuing of import licences.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I believe that, in view of the measures adopted at EU level both in terms of increasing protection of human health and restoring consumer confidence in beef and providing market supports, it is not necessary at this stage to extend the aids for private storage scheme.</P>

      <P>The calculation of the <Col N="1289" /> annual ewe premium is based on a single income loss which is the difference between the basic price and the average EU price. This system was introduced in 1992. Prior to that the ewe premium was based on regionalised prices rather than prices in individual member states. A system based on Irish prices alone would be beneficial for Irish producers.</P>
      <P>I have made strong representations to the EU Commission and to the Council of Agriculture Ministers over the years and most recently I raised it again at the recent sheepmeat conference in Brussels. I pointed out in particular that the question of the income gap between Irish and other EU producers needs to be addressed in any reform of the regime.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to headage and premium payments generally is that since 1 January 2000 some £712 million has been paid to farmers of which in excess of <Col N="1291" /> £406 million relates to payments made under the 2000 schemes. To date in 2000, some £19 million has been paid to farmers in County Westmeath. The position with regard to payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme is that over 90% of applicants in County Westmeath have now been paid their entitlements whereas 88% of all applicants countrywide have been paid to date.</P>
      <P>The total number of applications received under 2000 suckler cow premium was 71,511 of which 1,668 were received in County Westmeath. Under EU regulations at least 10% of applications must be field inspected. The cases are selected by risk analysis. In addition some others have to be selected for inspection because of queries on their applications, problems with previous year's applications, etc.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of unpaid cases in County Westmeath and indeed at national level are resulting from errors in area aid applications and in scheme applications which have to be resolved before payment is made.  In addition a small number of cases have to be inspected to determine their eligibility and payment will be made as soon as this is established. It should be noted, however, that, ultimately, not all applicants get paid because a small proportion are deemed to be ineligible for one reason or another.</P>

Formal clearance and approval is still awaited from the EU Commission in relation to the new scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards to operate as a State aid. I anticipate that the two schemes will be open to applicants by the end of January 2001.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the new schemes will be open to farmers with a minimum of 20 income units from farming together with sufficient other income to ensure the viability of the farm up to a maximum of 200 income units including off-farm income.</P>
      <P>Eligible applicants will also be required to meet certain minimum agricultural experience and training criteria and follow good farming practice. The grant aid will be calculated at the rate of 40% for farmers having up to 150 income units while farmers having more than 150 income units and up to a maximum of 200 income units will be eligible for a 20% grant rate. The maximum investment eligible for grant aid will be £40,000 under the farm waste management scheme and £25,000 under the scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards. In addition, young trained farmers under 35 years will qualify for additional aid at the rate of 15% in the less favoured areas and 5% in the rest of the country under both schemes.</P>

      <P>Live cattle exports to end November 2000 are currently 3% ahead of 1999 levels.</P>
      <P>Details of cattle exports in the last four years, to end November, are as follows: 1997 &ndash; 49,957; 1998 &ndash; 298,740; 1999 &ndash; 377,879; 2000 &ndash; 389,747.</P>
      <P>Exports of live cattle both to third country and continental EU markets have grown strongly in recent years. The increase is driven mainly by a high demand for calves and weanlings from Continental EU markets especially Spain and Italy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland must now put in place a workable, credible and reliable system of sheep identification without delay. Factors affecting this decision include the unsatisfactory nature of our current system and the need to implement EU legislation; the increasingly important need for identification and traceability for disease control purposes, whether in relation to scrapie or other diseases; and the outcome of the examination by the sheepment forum of issues affecting development of the sector. The forum comprised producers, processors and agencies involved in the sector. In its report it recognised the need for a sheep traceabilty system and gave its support to its introduction, and market developments, particularly the introduction of a sheep tagging scheme by the UK, our main competitor on the French market.</P>
      <P>Given the foregoing, it has been decided to introduce a sheep identification system in Ireland and to work towards its introduction from March 2001.</P>
      <P>In designing the system to be introduced my Department has placed the emphasis on minimising both bureaucracy and cost.</P>
      <P>Identification will be by means of tagging and will be based on flock numbers, although farmers will have the option of individual tagging. All sheep on farm will have to be tagged in the left ear within six months of birth or on movement off farm, whichever is the sooner.</P>
      <P>While certain minimum specifications will be laid down, the type of tag to be used will be left to the farmer's choice. In addition it is proposed that a lightweight short-term tag will be permitted for lambs going directly from the farm to slaughter. In other instances a more durable tag will be used.</P>
      <P>Additional movements between holdings will be traced via additional tagging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK sheep identification system, to commence on 1 January next, is also based on flock tagging, while the French national system <Col N="1295" /> requires the individual tagging of all sheep within 30 days of birth.</P>
    <P>My Department has already met with farmer representative bodies and others to explain its plans and will shortly begin the process of informing the sheep sector at large about the detailed operational aspects of the proposed system and I expect further discussions to take place. I hope that all concerned will work together with my Department towards introducing the new system as smoothly as possible.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on agriculture started in March 2000 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, in accordance with article 20 of the 1994 Agreement on Agriculture which was concluded as part of the last round of multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. The first phase of the negotiations is a preparatory one, during which WTO members are submitting negotiating proposals in preparation for the commencement of substantive negotiations in 2001.</P>
      <P>The European Union participates in the WTO negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The EU negotiating mandate for agriculture was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and endorsed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. The mandate is based primarily on the Agenda 2000 agreement decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999. At its meeting on 21 November 2000 the Council of Agriculture Ministers approved a comprehensive negotiating proposal, based on the mandate already agreed, which will be forwarded to Geneva before the end of the year. I am satisfied that this negotiating proposal provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries and it is my intention to ensure that these interests will be fully protected in the negotiations themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the changes in the trading environment which may result from the WTO negotiations and from enlargement of the EU as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels and general technological developments, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries over this decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010 was completed earlier this year and I have approved and published a plan of action for the implementation of its recommendations. As a <Col N="1296" /> result, I expect that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

The 2000 scheme provided for the part restructuring of quotas for the first time.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 136, 137 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the newspaper report referred to alleging that a pig producer had been supplying <Col N="1299" /> pigs fed on meat and bone meal to a local factory under the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The position is that the use of meat and bone in feed for non-ruminants has been permitted under national legislation in accordance with licences issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>I understand from Bord Bia, which carried out a detailed on site review of the plant in question, that this review revealed no evidence that pigs from this farm had been processed under its quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the export of Irish pork and bacon products from pigs fed on meat and bone meal, MBM, to the UK, such trade has been permitted under national and EU law. However, the feeding of meat and bone meal to all farm animals will shortly be banned within the EU and I will be taking appropriate measures to implement this ban.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the ban on feeding MBM to all farm animals is based primarily on the fact that other member states have failed to impose the controls necessary to avoid MBM being fed to ruminants rather than on a perceived risk to non-ruminants, including pigs, from feeding MBM. Ireland has such controls in place and these were considerably strengthened in 1996. Ireland's controls in this area have been independently assessed at various times over the past number of years and have been found to be rigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>The decision in principle to issue licences was taken in June 1997. These licences were first issued on 19 September 1997 and were last renewed in this case on 25 November 1999. They expired on 24 November 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bord Bia pigmeat quality assurance scheme is a voluntary initiative between Bord Bia and the pigmeat industry and is designed to underpin the marketing and promotion of Irish pigmeat.</P>
      <P> The provisions of the scheme are documented in a technical manual. It is the responsibility of each member plant to comply with the requirements laid down in the manual. Compliance is monitored by audit. Audits are carried out by external International Register of Certified Auditors approved auditors independent of Bord Bia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current scheme was revised in 1997 and the new technical manual issued to the industry in January 1998. This was post the 1996 BSE crisis. While the feeding of meat and bonemeal to non-ruminants, including pigs, was legal, Bord Bia decided to acknowledge and anticipate con<Col N="1300" /> sumer concerns and, accordingly, included a provision excluding pigs fed with meat and bonemeal from the scheme.</P>
    <P>Member plants of the quality assurance scheme are not precluded from purchasing pigs that have been fed meat and bonemeal but it is a strict condition that they must have in place a traceability system which ensures that these pigs are segregated and are not processed under the quality assurance scheme. Audits carried out in member plants have revealed no instance of meat and bonemeal fed pigs being processed under the quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department oversees the activities of Bord Bia in general and the operation of the Bord Bia legislation but does not have any direct role in the operation or monitoring of the scheme. However, my Department is represented on a technical committee that is responsible for developing and reviewing the scheme. Earlier this year, Bord Bia established with the approval of my Department a separate subsidiary board, to be known as the quality assurance board, to oversee the operation of all its quality assurance programmes. My Department is represented on this subsidiary board.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the question refers to section 94(3) Finance Act, 2000, which included a provision relating to the repayment of excise duty on hydrocarbon oil used in the provision of school bus services.</P>
      <P>The effect of that provision is twofold &ndash; to regularise the payment of excise refunds on an ongoing basis and to provide a basis for refunds backdated to 1 January 1997, or an earlier date if so prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Arising from this, payments to school bus operators are ongoing and refunds are being made in respect of the period since 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards the position prior to that date, Revenue wrote on 27 October 2000 to the relevant representative bodies setting out its view on the matter.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to occupational pension schemes. Revenue rules in relation to approved occupational pension schemes provide that lump sums benefits paid to employees at normal retirement age may not exceed 1.5 times the final remuneration of the employee where he or she served with the employer for 20 years up to the date of retirement. A sliding scale of lump sum benefits operates for service of less than 20 years and a reduced lump sum may be paid in cases of early retirement, but not earlier than age 50. In the case of early retirement at age 50, the balance of the fund after taking the tax free lump sum is payable in the form of a taxable annuity or pension and be subject to PAYE and appropriate PRSI deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that there may be some difficulties with the Deputy's proposal that benefits of up to £12,500 could be taken in lump sum form at age 50. First, it could be argued that it is an arbitrary figure in that it may not be based on any analysis in relation to occupational pension scheme benefits. It could cause particular difficulties where funds are valued at amounts marginally in excess of £12,500. Second, the proposal would need to <Col N="1303" /> be considered in the light of the fact that many individuals would, on attainment of age 50, still be involved in the workforce and be accruing pension benefits with new employers. It would be imprudent to encourage, by favourable tax treatment, the taking of benefits in lump sum form at age 50 at a time when an individual may be earning in full-time employment, to the detriment of increased pension benefits being available at eventual retirement date when they would be more likely to be needed to supplement the benefits from the final scheme of the employee.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, before such a proposed change to pensions legislation could be made it would seem prudent to have the matter fully considered by my officials. I have referred the Deputy's proposal for consideration to a special pensions working group comprising representatives from the relevant Departments and the Pensions Board. The Deputy may be aware that I made significant changes to pension arrangements in the Finance Acts, 1999 and 2000, in relation to the provision of approved retirement funds and preparations are under way to introduce legislation governing personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, in accordance with a commitment given on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>A benefit-in-kind charge arises where a company incurs expenses in providing an asset solely or partially for an employee's own use. A benefit-in-kind charge would not arise where a company provides a computer to an employee solely for work purposes.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a computer provided to an employee for home use rather than for work purposes would attract a charge to income tax under the benefit in kind legislation.</P>
      <P>At present a number of individuals telework from home. They are frequently provided with computers, and accessories such as printers, scanners and other communication equipment such as modems and fax machines, by their employers to enable them perform their duties of employment.</P>
      <P>These items would not normally attract a benefit-in-kind charge as they would be regarded as essential requirements for teleworking &ndash; in essence, they form part of the office facility for work.

      <P>In relation to the general hospital system I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding has been provided for the development of an accreditation programme in the major academic teaching hospitals, MATH's.

The focus of the standards is on the patient as he-she moves through an episode of care in the hospital. Standards have been developed around six inter-related functional areas applicable to each participating hospital: patient service groupings; leadership; information management; environment management; human resource management; and partnership</P>
      <P>Development work as a whole, including the formal establishment of an Irish accrediting agency, is on schedule. The target date for the first formal survey is the final quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>As part of the initial reception process for asylum seekers, communicable disease screening is offered on a voluntary basis to such persons during their stay at reception centres in Dublin. This service is offered in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves, their families and the community generally. The uptake for the service is approximately 75% and efforts continue to achieve further improvement in uptake. The health boards in other parts of the country have also been asked to ensure that screening is offered to asylum seekers accommodated in their area and who have not availed of screening during their stay in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The approach to be adopted in relation to communicable disease screening for asylum seekers was reviewed earlier this year by a group representative of the directors of public health and my Department.

The guidelines do not preclude other investigations deemed necessary on clinical or public health grounds.</P>

      <P>The identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency. The number of vacancies at any one time has to be looked at in this context. Current personnel policy for the health service provides that health agencies may fill non-consultant replacement posts without recourse to the Department. Consequently the information sought by the Deputy in relation to vacancies is not generally available.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that recruitment of personnel is carried out on an ongoing basis in most agencies and that the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of personnel would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
      <P>More specific information is available in relation to nurse vacancies. A survey of nursing vacancies at 30 September 2000 was carried out by the Health Service Employers' Agency. This found that the overall position, 1,388 vacancies, was slightly worse than that pertaining at 30 September 1999. The net vacancy position stood at 476 when account is taken of agency nurses and overtime working. A copy of the survey will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The survey found again that difficulties largely relate to the Dublin area. The major Dublin acute hospitals account for a large percentage of the vacancies in the eastern region. These hospitals have engaged in a successful international recruitment drive. However, the full impact of recruitment campaigns is not reflected in the survey as many of the nurses recruited abroad had not started work at that time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not readily available to my Department. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to furnish the information directly to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families are being facilitated by health boards and hospitals regarding the return of children's tissue-organs following post mortem examinations and I understand that this process is ongoing. In December 1999 my Department wrote to health boards regarding the issue of organ retention when the chief executive officers were asked to adopt a systematic and comprehen<Col N="1333" /> sive response to the concerns of parents and families. This response was to ensure that the individual needs of parents and families would be met and should, at a minimum, include the provision of specific information, counselling and other appropriate support services where required. The response also included a provision for financial support in individual cases to families who wished to make private arrangements for interment of retained organs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have established an inquiry to review post mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970 and in particular as it related to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside the State. The inquiry will be in two phases. Phase one will be conducted by Ms Anne Dunne SC. On completion of the first phase of the inquiry and on receipt of its report, I will table a motion in the Dáil that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
    <P>It is my wish that the joint committee fully consider the report and take whatever actions it deems fit. The joint committee has powers of compellability and discoverability available to it under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. In considering the report the committee will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public inquiry and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a high level of interest in alternative medicinal products and in the practice of complementary and alternative medicine.</P>
      <P>In regard to herbal medicinal products, I asked the Irish Medicines Board to examine the possibility of establishing a simplified licensing scheme for such products. Earlier this year, my Department sanctioned the appointment of a herbal medicines project manager to the IMB to facilitate the introduction of such a scheme and I have recently received an interim progress report from the IMB which is currently being considered in my Department. As the Deputy is aware, this issue is also being addressed at EU level by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee and any national scheme introduced must of necessity be on an interim basis pending the introduction of appropriate EU measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently there is no regulation by statute of the practitioners of the various complementary medicine and alternative medicine therapies and there are no proposals to regulate such practices at this stage. It is desirable, however, to afford <Col N="1334" /> some protection to members of the public who wish to avail of such therapies and it is my Department's policy to encourage the various therapies to establish their own regulatory structures and to develop mechanisms to inform the public about the availability of services from reputable practitioners. My Department intends to convene a consultative forum to discuss statutory registration with representative bodies of the various therapeutic providers of non-conventional medicine. In preparation for this arrangements are being made to survey the regulatory framework for complementary therapies in a number of EU member states.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries into the matter raised by the Deputy and I understand that phase two of the development at Naas General Hospital commenced on site in November 1999. Funding for the development is provided for under the national development plan. I have been informed that the project is eight weeks behind programme due primarily to the unavailability of an adequate number of site operatives to maintain progress in accordance with the programme. Phase two is programmed for completion in two stages. Stage one, the major element of phase two, is programmed for completion in November 2001 and stage two is programmed for completion in July 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of beds at Naas General <Col N="1335" /> Hospital is 124. Of these 124 beds, 94 are in-patient beds formally approved under Article 8 of the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, and 30 are located in the psychiatric unit which was provided under phase 1 of the development.</P>
    <P>Prior to the commencement of phase 2 of the development the hospital provided the following facilities:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The number on the in-patient waiting lists for ENT at 30 September 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 6,712. This is a welcome reduction of 10.3% on the ENT figure of 7,486 at 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that the overall numbers on waiting lists fell by 7,198 which is a reduction of 19.5% on the end of December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated this year to health agencies and £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
      <P>This investment is being made in conjunction with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative which I recently announced. In this regard, I was pleased to announce an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non-acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Under the winter initiative, at least 500 additional nursing home places will be contracted from private nursing homes. I am satisfied that this element of the initiative will increase the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of inappropriate use of hospital beds and will enhance the level of step down care available.</P>

      <P>Adult cardiac by-pass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. The course of treatment and the scheduling of cardiac surgery is a matter for hospital authorities in the first instance, based on clinical assessment of need and urgent cases always receive priority.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my predecessor allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, my predecessor made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I made a further £4 million available in 2000. Funding of £7.6 million for the further development of cardiac surgery services has also been made available for 2001. I am confident that this funding will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had and will continue to have a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients, adults and children, awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,586 in September 1977 to 868 in June 2000, which represents a reduction of 55%.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for adults and three months for children. I am confident the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by more than 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> The programme of referring children abroad to the UK for cardiac surgery will continue to be funded in 2001 and new proposals to refer children to the USA have been identified as a measure towards the overall objective of reducing waiting times to three months for children awaiting cardiac surgery.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental care is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and have phased out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools. Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s). The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc., is provided as necessary.</P>
      <P>Children are eligible for dental treatment up to their 16th birthday.</P>
      <P>An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children at primary school level.</P>
      <P>I accept that there are difficulties in providing an adequate orthodontic service for children where a need for such treatment has been identified through the school-based target approach for the delivery of dental services. Waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that funds for an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists have been provided by the Government in the current budget. A total <Col N="1340" /> of £3.7 million is being provided on an ongoing basis which will enable health boards to recruit additional staff, provide additional services for existing staff and make additional arrangements with private orthodontists. I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>The ultimate effect of this initiative will be to increase numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum. This initiative, when in full stream, and together with structural changes being introduced in the orthodontic services should make it possible for a number of boards to eventually reduce waiting times for treatment to one year. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out as part of this initiative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme was formally launched on 10 October last. Phase I of the programme will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have received the report of the sub-group of the national cancer forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. I have considered this report, and I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. I established an advisory group, chaired by Prof. Niall O'Higgins, St. Vin<Col N="1341" /> cent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of new symptomatic breast disease services which I am announcing today will greatly enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 to 183, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities operate a sale of sites scheme which is designed to assist people in need of housing to obtain sites from their local authority at low cost and to provide for their housing needs, either individually or through co-operative or voluntary housing bodies. Under the terms of circular H05/00 of 15 June 2000 a subsidy was, <i>inter alia</i>, introduced by my Department to assist local authorities in the provision of such sites to eligible applicants. In addition a claw-back provision related to the difference between the market value of the site and the price at which the site was made available to the applicant was introduced with effect from 15 June 2000. Subsequently, a clarification in respect of the terms of the claw-back provision was issued by circular H05/00A of 29 June which substantially restated the original provisions of circular H05/00 of 15 June 2000. The provision of a subsidy financed from public funds is necessary to encourage and assist local authorities to make sites available at low cost to eligible households seeking to attain home ownership while the provision for a claw-back is also necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house provided on a subsidised site.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently preparing regulations providing for the site subsidy and claw-back provisions. In this context, transitional arrangements will be introduced which will provide that the claw-back provision will not apply where a formal written offer of a site was made by the local authority to an applicant on or before 15 June 2000. These transitional arrangements will apply in the case of the Ballyowen Lane Co-op. Information on the number and location of dwellings affected by the new arrangements is not available in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider approaching local authorities in relation to the reassessment of rents charged to tenants following budget increases to recipients of social welfare and health board payments, in view of claims that in households which are exclusively or predominantly reliant upon such payments the rent reassessment can lead to the local authority absorbing up to 75% of the increase in welfare payments.</Quest>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible, as an integral part of their housing management functions, for the determination of the rents of their dwellings under the differential rents scheme and of the income to be assessed for this purpose. Authorities have full discretion in these matters subject to compliance with following broad principles: the rent payable should be related to the income of the tenants and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low-income households; allowances should be made for <Col N="1345" /> dependent children; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners; and provision should be made to accept a lower rent in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>In setting rent levels local authorities should also ensure that overall rental income reflects adequately, in so far as is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of their housing stock, having regard to appropriate local factors. The most recent information available indicates that, in 1999, rental income amounted to only 63% of the cost of the management and maintenance of their rented housing stock.</P>
      <P>I understand that, for example, in the case of the Dublin local authorities, differential rent increases would absorb between 10% and 15% of income arising solely from social welfare or general wage increases. I am satisfied that authorities have discretion to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in individual cases.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, no proposals to change the existing arrangements, which are in keeping with Government policy of maximum devolution of local functions to local authorities.</P>

      <P>It is incumbent on the owner of an end-of-life vehicle &ndash; ELV &ndash; to dispose of it in a responsible manner, by transferring it to one of a number of facilities that have been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles.</P>
      <P>Section 32(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies,<i> inter alia,</i> to the owner of an ELV. Section 71 of the 1996 Act specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with abandoned cars. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department is engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry &ndash; SIMI &ndash; and other concerned parties with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of an EU Parliament and Council directive on end-of-life vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000 and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive incorporates a number of signifi<Col N="1346" /> cant proposals, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs; ensuring that all ELVs collected are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components; and minimising the use of hazardous materials-substances in vehicles.</P>
    <P>My Department recently responded to SIMI regarding its initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland and will seek early discussions with the society and other concerned parties to progress the development of a practicable industry-led scheme. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Acts focus primarily on the use of vehicles in public places. A prohibition on the supply of vehicles to certain classes of persons would not be appropriate under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible, as an integral part of their housing management functions, for the determination of the rents of their dwellings under the differential rents scheme and of the income to be assessed for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Local authority rents are generally income related and the average rent payable in 1999 was £16.50 per week. I am satisfied that the level of rents charged by authorities is reasonable and that they have discretion to deal with problems which may arise in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rental income meets only some 63% of the cost of management and maintenance of the local authority rented housing stock. Compensation for any shortfall in rental income of local authorities <Col N="1347" /> would have to be funded from increased general taxation which in itself would be potentially inflationary. I have, therefore, no proposals to introduce a moratorium as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy on 5 December 2000, the Department suspended payment to the person concerned with effect from 19 October 2000 as she had failed to provide satisfactory evidence of her efforts to obtain maintenance for herself and her child or of her earnings and the lease arrangements on her rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>A copy of her maintenance order and lease agreement has now been received by the Department, but a P45 or similar statement from her employer confirming her gross weekly earnings is still awaited. As soon as this documentation is received a decision will be made on her claim and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, I have introduced a number of important changes to improve these arrangements. These include an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 in 1999, and the extension of the scope of this grant; the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to  widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widows/widowers contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant in budget 2000; and a number of additional measures in this year's Social Welfare Act to address the position where the six weeks after death  payment was not made or was paid at a reduced amount.</P>
      <P>Any further developments in the bereavement grant will be considered in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone.</P>
      <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to caring for our older people by advancing the goal of bringing the old age contributory pension to £100 per week and by extending the £100 commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. In budget 2001 further significant progress was made towards achieving this goal following significant increases in social welfare pension rates. With effect from the first week in April 2001, the personal rate of old age contributory pension will be increased to £106 per week. The equivalent rate for old age non-contributory pension will be increased to £95.50 per week.</P>
      <P>This represents an overall increase of £28 per week for both schemes since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>These measures reflect the emphasis I have placed on improving the personal pension rates of our older people which I believe is the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved.</P>

      <P>Payment of one-parent family allowance has not been withdrawn in this case. The continuing entitlement of the person concerned is, however, under review in the light of evidence suggesting that she and another person are living together as man and wife. The matter will be determined by a statutorily appointed deciding officer in the light of all the facts and also in the light of any evidence which the person concerned submits in support of her case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that during a routine review of her claim in October 2000, the person concerned informed a local officer of the Department that she had applied for housing to Kildare County Council jointly with the putative father of her <Col N="1349" /> child. This officer also obtained during the course of this investigation information which indicated that she and another person were living together as man and wife. As the Deputy will appreciate cohabitation as man and wife would disqualify her for one-parent family payment under the conditions applicable to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proper procedures were applied during the course of this investigation. The person concerned was advised of the evidence available to the Department on 27 November 2000 and was given the opportunity to submit, within 21 days, any information she wished before a decision is taken on her claim.</P>
    <P>On receipt of her response, or on the expiry of the 21 days allowed for reply, a decision will be made on her continued entitlement to one-parent family payment and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Payment will continue until the review process is completed and a decision on her continuing entitlement is given.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has not yet responded to a request by the Department in July 2000 for details of her previous earning levels.

      <P>The Department requested a statement from the employer of the person concerned confirming her date of commencement of employment and her gross weekly income. Her employer responded in July 2000, confirming that the person concerned had commenced employment on 9 September 1997 and stating her current gross income.</P>
      <P>The Department wrote to the person concerned on 23 November 2000, outlining the information available and affording her the opportunity within 21 days to provide any information she wished to be taken in account before a decision is taken on her entitlement. As soon as a response is received from her, or at the expiry of the 21 days, a decision will be made on her claim and she be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that no application for a Garda CCTV system has been received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, in respect of Buncrana, Moville or Carndonagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, <Col N="1354" /> £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme in 2001 to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced early in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether children under 14 should be walking the streets alone or in groups after 9 p.m.; if he has any plans to introduce legislation to help deter such children from engaging in anti-social behaviour; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>While young children who are regularly on the streets late at night are a cause of concern, there are also perfectly legitimate reasons why other young people may be out of doors on an occasional basis. The legislative approach I have taken is, therefore, focused on the problem individuals.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1999, which is at present awaiting Committee Stage before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, provides a statutory basis for the imposition of curfews on young offenders. Section 133 of the Bill gives the courts power to order that a child whom it has found guilty of an offence be at a particular residence at any times between 7.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m. the following morning or that a child stay away from any specified premises, place or locality during specified days or between specified times. The Garda can call at the residence at which the child must be for the purpose of establishing that the child is present there at the relevant time.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the possibility of curfews as a condition of the grant of temporary leave from children detention schools. In addition, curfews could form part of the action plan which may be formulated under the restorative conferencing provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> The Bill also provides for family welfare conferences for children at risk, which will be convened by the health boards, as well as a statutory diversion programme, operated by the Garda Síochána, which will include restorative conferencing and restorative cautioning.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government has committed £250 million to the child care measure under the National Development Plan 2000-06. In April of this year, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for child care providers under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that application forms for capital and staffing grants for community based not-for-profit groups were requested on 25 September by the group in question and forwarded on 27 September 2000 by the equal opportunities child care section of my Department. I have been informed by the section that, to date, no completed application forms for any of the measures contained in the equal opportunities child care programme have been received from the group in question.</P>
      <P>While my Department has no closing date on the child care grants scheme, funding can only be allocated to groups on receipt of an application form and the completion of the assessment and appraisal process. My Department will, of course, give due consideration to any application for funding submitted for child care facilities from providers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The majority of the cases waiting forensic examination are drug analysis cases. This situation has arisen as a result of the recent success of the Garda Síochána in drug seizures. In 1998 and 1999, for example, illicit drugs with an estimated street value of £120 million were seized.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 to 216, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two new independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers appeals.</P>
    <P>The information which was used in the assessment of the case referred to by the Deputy was made available to the applicant for the purposes of an appeal which was rejected by the independent appeals authority.</P>
    <P>I would point out that having regard to section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which is intended to protect the identities of asylum applicants, it is not appropriate to disclose information in relation to an individual asylum application. In so far as an individual application for asylum is concerned, it would also be inappropriate to comment on the situation on the ground in any particular country of origin.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that in considering all asylum applications consideration is given to the subjective and objective elements of a claim for refugee status. The subjective element of an asylum claim would have regard to the individual circumstances as perceived and described by the applicant. The objective element of the claim would have regard to the relevant country of origin information which comes from a wide variety of sources, including information from the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, US State Department, Canadian boards of immigration and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources. In addition to these periodically updated sources, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner has access to up to date news reports regarding events and developments in the countries concerned.</P>

    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the most recent census figures available are for 1996 but that updated figures will be available next year. I am further informed that four intakes of trainee gardaí totalling 500 are scheduled to be attested to the Garda Síochána in 2001. As each intake of trainee gardaí is attested, the needs of the eastern part of the country will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. This may include computer equipment and software. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. The equipment remains the property of the school. A designated teacher in the school has responsibility for the management of the equipment and for monitoring its effective use within the school. In the majority of cases this teacher is able to provide the necessary tuition to enable the pupil to make full use of the equipment and software.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The pupil in question was provided with computer equipment and specialised software in March 2000. The school in question did not request special tuition at that time and has not requested it since then. My officials were in touch with the school yesterday to ascertain if there is a need for tuition. The school has indicated that it will consider whether special tuition is required and if necessary make an application to my Department. If submitted, my Department will process an application from the school without delay.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that given the large number of these recommendations and taking account of staff limitations and the major implications in relating to funding, it is not possible to put all the recommendations in place with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Some improvements have been announced in relation to areas where assessments have been completed. These include extended eligibility for pupils where bullying is proven or the nearest school building is physically unsuitable. I anticipate that a suitable means of communication will be introduced on school transport services before the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Additional finance has been secured in the budget for improvements to the school transport scheme. Announcements will be made in the matter in due course.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the student to whom the Deputy refers already holds a third level qualification, a diploma of higher education in nursing awarded by South Bank University, London.</P>
      <P>She applied to County Waterford VEC for grant assistance under the terms of the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees 2000.</P>
      <P>This scheme applies to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects in line with the Government's sectoral employment priorities. The student in question is not eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the scheme as she already holds a third level qualification. She would, however, be eligible to apply for funding under the terms of the student support schemes, if she were to enter a degree level course </P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>

      <P>I have previously welcomed the report, referred to by the Deputy, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the recommendations made for <Col N="1367" /> future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. I am satisfied that the introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>My approach to date clearly shows my commitment and determination in this extremely important area of education and it is my intention that this report will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>At second level the funding assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary secondary schools with 200 pupils or more in the free education scheme receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in <Col N="1368" /> the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion. In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements and is a most valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>

Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>

      <P>At second level the resources provided by my Department reflect the different management and ownership arrangements </P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September this year to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 to £202 for the next school year. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is payable to disadvantaged schools. Accordingly this increase will bring the <i>per capita</i> payment to £232. In addition, and in recognition of the cash flow needs of schools, I am arranging to bring forward the payment of the next instalment of the <i>per capita</i> grant from January 2001 to later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. The way in which the grant is distributed among schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.</P>
    <P>Community and comprehensive schools unlike voluntary secondary schools do not receive <i>per capita</i> grants. Instead, each school is given a budget based mainly on pupil numbers, but which also takes into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as disadvantaged status, age of buildings, size of school, etc. Budget allocations for the VEC and community and comprehensive sectors are increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
    <P>All schools are eligible for recurrent <i>per capita </i>grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
    <P>The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner, which has created structures that lack uniformity and cohesion. This is a reflection of the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements and is a most valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. It is my intention that this report will inform policy on future school funding. While I intend to direct my energies to address the issues raised in the report, I want to emphasise that my priority in this regard is the adequacy of funding.</P>

All second level schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school.

As a result of these measures, almost 850 trained teachers qualified this year, while the 2001 figure will be in excess of 1,000. These figures represent a huge increase on the 1997 figure, when 429 graduated.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the intake of students to the colleges of education was increased to 1,000 in 1999.

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Departments. As most of the nominations have now been received, I will be in a position to establish the designate board in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the subjects for which quota's are used for places on the higher diploma in education course; the plans he has to extend these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 to 246, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are two principal routes available to aspiring teachers of science subjects.</P>
      <P>The concurrent model comprises the B.Sc. Science Education in Dublin City University and the B.Sc. Science with concurrent teacher training in the University of Limerick. There were 23 entrants to the first year of the DCU course, which commenced in 1999-00. Numbers of new entrants to the UL course were 32 in 1997-98, 38 in 1998-99 and 43 in 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>However, the main route for qualification as a teacher of science subjects concerns the consecutive model where students obtain a relevant primary degree followed by a Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
      <P>Entry to the higher diploma is limited by an entry quota, the setting of which is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department and the Higher Education Authority. As part of this process, a survey was undertaken in 1997 at the request of a joint working group representative of my Department, the Higher Education Authority and the universities to elicit the views of school principals on the difficulties encountered in recruiting teachers generally and to determine whether particular difficulties existed in specific subjects. A total of 656 principals &ndash; 86% of all principals &ndash; participated in the survey, of whom 591 had recruited staff for the 1996-97 school year. The survey found that 339 principals reported some difficulties in recruitment and that the level of difficulty varied between subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the survey results and other analyses, the working group recommended that the aggregate quota for the Higher Diploma in Education should be increased and that places should be allocated within the increased quota for specific subjects. These quotas were to apply for Irish, religion, Spanish, Italian, physics and chemistry. On foot of this recommendation, the aggregate intake quota was increased from 800 in 1997-98 to 900 in 1999 and to 960 in 1999-00. A further 40 places are provided in respect of a higher diploma through the medium of Irish in NUIG. The total <Col N="1374" /> number of Higher Diploma in Education places therefore increased by 20% in two years.</P>
    <P>Some difficulties have arisen concerning the application of the subject-specific quotas within the Higher Diploma in Education and my Department is in consultation with the universities and the Higher Education Authority on the matter. Decisions as to whether to extend or vary these quotas will be informed by the outcome of these consultations and by reference to continuing review of the position on teacher supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Figures on the numbers of Higher Diploma in Education graduates for each of the past five years with physics or chemistry as one of their subjects are not readily available. Further inquiries are being made with the Higher Education Authority and the education departments of the universities as to the feasibility of compiling the data and a response on the matter will issue directly to the Deputy in due course.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have established a task force on the physical sciences to support further the promotion of these subjects at second and third level. The task force will, <i>inter alia</i>, address issues concerning the support and promotion of high quality teaching provision in the physical sciences.</P>

      <Quest>if NEPS have now appointed educational psychologists to cover the remainder of the primary schools in north County Kildare; if not, when the appointments will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Twenty-six additional psychologists have taken up their posts in the national educational psychological service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; since the beginning of September. Three of these psychologists have joined the eastern region &ndash; south west area &ndash; team, which serves County Kildare and more will be assigned to the team after Christmas. As soon as they have completed their programme of induction training, they will begin visiting schools.</P>
      <P>I am unable to say at present which primary schools in north County Kildare will be included in the next expansion phase of NEPS. However, I am aware that difficulties have been experienced by schools in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. I have asked NEPS to develop a short-term strategy to alleviate the situation and I expect this to be in place early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme was basically designed to cater for children in rural areas, who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in attending regularly. In urban areas, schools are closer to the pupils' homes and scheduled transport is available.</P>
      <P>As a rule, special school transport services are not established in areas where public scheduled bus services already exist. Eligible pupils in such cases are, however, facilitated with travel permits for public scheduled services.</P>
      <P>Pupils for whom Coláiste Cois Life is their nearest all-Irish school are eligible for transport to this school provided that they live more than three miles from it. I understand that there are existing scheduled services, which leave the pupils 0.8 miles from the Coláiste, and there is a footbridge and public footpath between the set down point and Coláiste Cois Life. This is considered to be a reasonable level of service and there are no proposals at present to establish a dedicated school bus service for the pupils in question.</P>
