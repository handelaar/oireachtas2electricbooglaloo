      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Gay Mitchell. I call on Deputy Mitchell to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give notice of my intention to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an urgent matter of public concern, namely, the need to find secure places of detention for youths in danger, the failure of the Government to do so despite several warnings from a judge, the need to find and accommodate a particular child who is in danger and to ensure she receives secure and multi-disciplinary support, and the threats to hold three members of the Government in contempt of court for failing to meet their obligations in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 22, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 3) Regulations; No. 2, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage; No. 10, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 44, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 45, statements on the situation in the Middle East, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21, and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 22 shall be decided without debate; and (2) the proceedings on No. <Col N="798" /> 45, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the statements of a Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; and (iii) Members may share time.</P>

I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister if he will release the text of a letter which cannot in any way be construed to be a matter of State security. There is no point in us extending the terms of the freedom of information legislation if it is being frustrated for political reasons by this Administration.</P>

      <P>I have a very serious matter to raise on the Order of Business but before I do, I am sure you will allow this House to send its good wishes to Deputy Jim Mitchell who, as many of us will have heard this morning, is making a splendid <Col N="801" /> recovery from a very serious illness. I am sure we all wish him well and hope he will rejoin us as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise another matter of great seriousness. In an unprecedented move yesterday, Justice Peter Kelly of the High Court, threatened three Ministers in this Government with contempt of court. He has accused them of appalling incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may raise the matter briefly but it was raised on the Adjournment last evening, so we cannot have a prolonged debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it is normal practice that you would allow the person leading off to speak. The judge has accused the three Ministers and the relevant health board of appalling incompetence. I want the Tánaiste to tell us exactly the action the Government will take to ensure that this particular young woman gets the care and attention she needs from the State and the actions it will take immediately to ensure that Justice Peter Kelly does not have to hold these three Ministers in contempt of court and perhaps jail them. It would be a sweet irony, quite frankly, if these three Ministers ended up in one of the jails. There probably would be no places for them.</P>
      <P>I want the Tánaiste to tell the House exactly what action will be taken today to deal with this young woman's case and to ensure services are provided for the other young people who are in need of care from the State which is failing in its duty to provide such care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Owen in wishing Deputy Jim Mitchell a speedy recovery. Everyone is delighted he has come through the operation so well. I did not hear him on radio this morning but he has shown great courage in confronting a very serious operation. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope he is back in the House soon.</P>
      <P>The case to which Deputy Owen referred is clearly a very sad and sensitive one and everything the health board asked for in this case was granted. Accommodation was provided at a cost of £250,000 and eight staff were recruited for that house. Notwithstanding that, this young woman has escaped from the support unit and clearly every effort is being made to find her. Anything that is required in this case will be granted by the Government, and we are anxious that that be the case. Everything that was asked for by the health board was granted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the problem that Justice Kelly does not seem to believe the Government's resolve to provide what is necessary for this girl and for the many other cases? Will the Tánaiste tell the House how the Government will resolve <Col N="802" /> the problem of the lack of staff needed for these secure care places because that is what is at the heart of this matter? The Government does not seem to have made any decision on or taken action to solve this problem. Justice Kelly will find the three Ministers in contempt of court if they do not take more action than that which they are taking today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this young woman escaped from hospital but staff were recruited and, unfortunately, left for particular reasons. Every effort will be made to recruit more staff to ensure that the needs of this young woman and others like her are met. She escaped from hospital, notwithstanding the best efforts of the staff involved with her. Unfortunately, from time to time this happens and I regret it very much. I hope she is found soon and that all the facilities required are put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach informed the House that at a recent Government meeting the amendments to the Children Bill had been passed but, as I speak, they have not been circulated. I presume they are in the process of being circulated. Will the Tánaiste indicate if the Government is now prepared to request the chairman of the relevant committee, Deputy Ardagh, to take the amendments as a matter of extreme urgency so that we can move from the particularities of this case that has just been cited to putting in place the necessary legislative provisions that are clearly required? Will the Tánaiste indicate when the amendments will be circulated, if they have not been circulated already? For these amendments to be taken requires that the Department supply the staff to do the work. Perhaps the Tánaiste will reply to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the committee to order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, a Cheann Comhairle, as you are aware, the committee cannot initiate this proceeding under this practice until it receives indication from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is ready. Although you have interpreted the matter as you see and understand it, the political reality is that the Government chairman of that committee will not move that business until such time, as is normal and reasonable, that the Department is ready to co-operate. It is not, technically speaking, a matter for the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the Government is very anxious that the committee will meet quickly and the amendments, which were approved by the Cabinet this week, will be made available as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I did not make a statement in America, although one is entitled to make statements. Freedom of speech is a good thing. On Deputy Owen's point, the concerns that have been expressed do not relate to the work permit legislation. They relate to the registration of employment agencies and it is an offence under the licensing regime for an employment agency to charge a fee. If an employment agency charged the fees suggested, which in the Philippines would be about three years' salary, the licence will be revoked, which can be done under the existing legislation.</P>

Such cases are repeatedly being brought to my attention. When will there be a statutory right for workers on long-term contracts here to bring their families with them?

      <P>During the discussions on Partnership 2000, both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, in the context of modernising our industrial relations procedures and institutions, agreed to devise a mechanism for resolving such disputes. A high level group was established to consider detailed proposals from congress on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain.</P>
      <P>The group consisted of representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and was chaired by an official from the Department of the Taoiseach. It issued a set of proposals in December 1997 which were not accepted by the trade unions generally. The Ryanair dispute highlighted the importance of developing solutions for similar disputes in the future. In December 1998, following publication of the report of inquiry into the dispute at Dublin Airport and the Supreme Court judgment in the Nolan Transport case, I reconvened the group and asked it to further consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group came up with an agreed set of proposals later that year. In summary, it reaffirmed that where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences <Col N="811" /> that arise between employers and employees is voluntary collective bargaining. The report went on to address the problems that arise in disputes where negotiating arrangements are not in place and recommended two distinct procedures to be put in place. The first of these is a voluntary one and is set out in the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution which was prepared by the Labour Relations Commission and published by the Tánaiste in May this year. The objective of this code is to provide a recognised framework for the processing of disputes in situations where negotiating arrangements are not in place and where collective bargaining fails to take place. It prescribes that management and unions should fully co-operate in seeking to resolve issues in dispute effectively and expeditiously by means of the following steps.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the matters should be referred to the Labour Relations Commission, which will appoint an officer from its advisory service to assess the issues in dispute. The LRC officer will work with the parties in an attempt to help them resolve the issues in dispute. In the event that the issues in dispute are not capable of early resolution by the LRC intervention, an agreed cooling-off period will be put in place. During the cooling-off period, the LRC's advisory service will continue to work with the parties in an attempt to resolve the outstanding issues. The commission may engage expert assistance, including the involvement of ICTU and IBEC, should that prove helpful to the resolution of any differences. If after the cooling-off period all issues have been resolved, the LRC will disengage. Before disengaging, the commission may make proposals to the parties on procedures for the peaceful resolution of any further grievances or disputes. Finally, in the event of issues remaining unresolved after the cooling-off period, the LRC shall make a written report to the Labour Court on the matter. The court shall consider the position of the employer and the union and issue recommendations on outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>This voluntary procedure was the preferred approach of the group. It is only in the case of parties not participating in this voluntary approach that a legislated fall-back procedure would come into play. It can be seen from its report that the group envisaged it would operate only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give effect to that special fall-back procedure. It provides for a unilateral referral by an authorised trade union or excepted body to the Labour Court in situations where the following circumstances pertain: it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute; the employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution mentioned earlier or has failed to observe such a provision in good faith; neither the trade union <Col N="812" /> nor the employees, as the case may be, have acted in a manner which, in the opinion of the court, has frustrated the employer in observing a provision of the code of practice; and, neither the trade union nor the employees have had recourse to industrial action after the dispute was referred to the commission in accordance with the provisions of the code of practice.</P>
    <P>The essential point is that, in order to trigger the special fall-back procedure provided for in this legislation, an employer must have failed to avail of, or failed to follow in good faith, the voluntary procedures as set out in the code of practice. If the employer has behaved in that fashion, a trade union can activate referral to the Labour Court under this new fall-back procedure, a procedure which can culminate in an outcome that is legally enforceable through the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out the various steps in this fall-back procedure. The court is empowered to investigate the issues in dispute and issue a recommendation in the normal way. If matters remain unresolved, the court may, at the request of either party, review all relevant matters and issue a determination. Ultimately, if matters remain unresolved, the court will issue a binding determination. Where an employer fails to comply with this latter determination, an enforcement order can be sought in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the various provisions of the Bill in general detail. Section 1 is a standard interpretation section which provides for the definition of certain terms that are mentioned later in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 covers the investigation of disputes by the Labour Court. In subsection (1) it specifies the circumstances under which the court will investigate a dispute. Subsection (2) requires the court to take account of any existing practices in place in the employment concerned for setting terms and conditions of employment and to have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives power to the court to hold a preliminary hearing to satisfy itself that the requirements of section 2 have been met. Section 4 extends the powers to summon and examine witnesses and require the production of documents to any investigation carried out under the Bill, which are granted to the court under section 21 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>Section 5 empowers the court to issue a recommendation on terms and conditions of employment and on dispute resolution and disciplinary procedures. Consistent with the overall approach to this legislation, it will not be open to the court to include arrangements for collective bargaining in its recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court recommendation issued under section 5 is not legally binding. However, if the recommendation does not result in the dispute being resolved, the court, under the power given to it in section 6, may, at the request of a trade union or excepted body, review all relevant matters and issue a binding determination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> Section 7 requires determinations issued by the court to be in writing, to be served on both parties and to include a statement setting out the reasons for its determination. Section 8 outlines the effect of industrial action. It requires the Labour Court, following a request from an employer or a trade union, to cease its involvement and withdraw any recommendation it has issued, if industrial action has taken place between the time the matter was referred to the Labour Relations Commission and the issue of a determination under section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the court to review and vacate, affirm or vary a determination where requested by either party, but not earlier than 12 months after the court made it. Section 10 enables a trade union to apply to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order where the binding Labour Court determination under section 6 has not been implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law only. Section 12 is a routine provision enabling the making of regulations. Section 13 outlines the short and collective titles for the Bill and prescribes that the Bill shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.</P>
    <P>In summary, this legislation provides a mechanism for processing claims on behalf of employees where an employer has refused to follow the voluntary procedure as outlined in the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. This new dispute settling power for the court reflects the consensus in the high level group. It will enable a trade union to progress pay or other conditions on behalf of its members in these cases which meet the criteria set out in section 2.</P>
    <P>Most trade union recognition disputes have their origins in concerns about pay and other conditions. This Bill will greatly improve the prospects of resolving these type of disputes. At present, trade unions can refer claims to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. However the court's recommendation is binding only on the trade union and not on the employer. The legislation which I am moving today will ensure finality by providing for the enforcement of Labour Court findings in the Circuit Court, if necessary. In other words, it will ensure there are no blank walls, that there will be a process which aggrieved workers and unions can use to resolve their differences.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Labour Party introduced the Trade Union Recognition Bill in the Dáil in February 1998. At that time, the high level group had been given the task by the previous Government of considering ICTU proposals on the matter in the context of chapter 9 of Partnership 2000. While the Private Members' Bill was a valuable contribution to the debate &ndash; which I have always acknowledged &ndash; I indicated at the time that my approach was to seek a consensus between IBEC and ICTU before agreeing to legislation.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that we now have agreed proposals for dealing with this sensitive issue. The <Col N="814" /> formula devised by the high level group represents a balanced response. Both unions and employers have opted for this approach, which reflects their preferred option of continuing our voluntarist tradition.</P>
    <P>The justification for such procedures as I have outlined in both the code of practice and the Bill was, as I said in the Seanad, put succinctly by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in his judgment in the Supreme Court in the Nolan Transport case when he said:</P>
    <P>The State, representing the rest of us ordinary citizens and taxpayers, has a very keen interest in seeing to the harmonisation of industrial relations. We all stand to lose too much where there is strife and conflict. We should now have advanced sufficiently in our respect for democracy and the rule of law and all its refinements to work out a better way. At this stage of our development this country should be an example to other countries on how to avoid industrial conflict, and when conflict does arise on how to resolve it speedily. That is good for everyone; it will lead to more employment and increased trade.</P>
    <P>He went on to state that &ldquo;employers have an obligation to accord trade unions a measure of respect: representing as they do the rights of the workers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The procedures we are now putting in place &ndash; the voluntary mechanism in the code of practice and the special fall-back procedure in this Bill &ndash; offer a method of dealing with the right to bargain in situations where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place and the parties have not engaged in talks.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to see the measures proposed in the Bill in the context of our overall approach to industrial relations procedures. The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism, and this approach has served us well over the years. Traditionally, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial dispute, but rather are designed to help and support the parties in their efforts to resolve their differences. The State has confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of third party machinery and a floor of statutory rights. I have put this case on many occasions over the past three years, as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, at European Union level, where we try to share best practice.</P>
    <P>I am proud that we have an unique position in European terms in regard to social partnership. Such a system enhances the general industrial relations debate at EU level.</P>
    <P>The State provides a number of dispute resolution services to assist workers and employers in resolving their differences. The Labour Relations Commission chairs more than 2,000 meetings per year and four fifths of these cases are settled at conciliation. Issues not resolved by the Labour Relations Commission are normally referred for <Col N="815" /> investigation to the Labour Court. Despite the fact that the majority of recommendations issued by the court are non-binding, there is an acceptance rate of more than 80% by parties to disputes. Those involved at Labour Relations Commission level and Labour Court level deserve great credit. We hear only about these organisations in times of conflict. It is important to note that in the majority of cases disputes are resolved. Their work is crucial to the economy and I take this opportunity to acknowledge it.</P>
    <P>A consensus exists among employers, trade unions and Government that voluntary collective bargaining should be the primary means of regulating industrial relations. Such collective agreements cover all issues arising in the employment relationship and &ndash; consistent with the notion of voluntarism &ndash; are not legally binding. They have a moral force only but, in practice, are all the more successful because of their voluntary nature. I might add, parenthetically, that the five national agreements since 1987 have promoted growth, competitiveness and social inclusion which surpassed even our wildest dreams. At the core of this collective bargaining has been the willingness on all sides, employers, workers, Government and others to take into account and appreciate the views and aspirations of others, thus facilitating a consensus approach to macro-economic issues based on partnership and mutual gains principles.</P>
    <P>All sections of society have benefited from the increased competitiveness of our economy. This consensus approach has involved a continuing commitment by employees to improvements in quality and efficiency and an acceptance by employers of employees as stakeholders with rights and interests to be considered in the context of decisions affecting the enterprise in which they work. The strains that are currently in evidence have much to do with managing our economic growth and our growing expectations. We cannot and must not fritter away the gains we have made by taking our eye off the ball of competitiveness and fairness. To do so would be short-sighted and no way to build a solid platform for further economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>Legislation can play an important role in underpinning the voluntarist approach to industrial relations. This Bill, which has the support of both sides in the employment relationship, will have a significant impact on reducing conflict between employers and workers in situations where collective bargaining is absent.</P>
    <P>The Bill passed all stages in the Upper House following a lively and constructive debate. I agreed to reflect on some issues raised and I will come back to these on Committee Stage. I look forward to hearing what Members have to say. Obviously I am open to considering some amendments.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="816" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the legislation which is based on the agreement between IBEC and ICTU, ably assisted by others and the discussions which preceded the introduction of the Bill. The Bill extends the existing legislation to give the Labour Court new powers to resolve disputes in circumstances where the parties have not engaged in talks. I welcome the measures contained therein where negotiating arrangements are not in place and where collective bargaining fails to take place.</P>
      <P>The basis of the legislation is in the establishment of the high level group under Partnership 2000, a programme with which my party was much involved. In Partnership 2000, ICTU and IBEC recognised the need to modernise our industrial relations procedures and institutions. One of the initiatives agreed was the establishment of this high level group to consider detailed proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of trade unions and the right to bargain. This partnership and the partnership agreements have served us well in the past. This legislation is viewed as the final mechanism in dispute resolution where talks have failed to resolve the particular issue, most likely in relation to pay or conditions. Even though the aim of the Bill is to resolve some of the more difficult disputes, it cannot resolve some of the current problems between the social partners. In a week when Dublin Airport is closed by strike action for the first time in 20 years in Aer Lingus, when the ASTI has voted for widespread industrial action, when the media has numerous stories of strikes and threatened strikes and inflation is at 6.2% for the second month in a row this is a sobering thought.</P>
      <P>Workers will not stand idly by and allow their living standards to be eroded. The Government must act as up to now it has pretended to take action in the hope that falling oil prices and the strengthening euro would take the sting out of inflation. Unfortunately the problems in the Middle East will increase rather than reduce the price of oil. The external value of the euro continues to languish. The inflation rate shows that the Government's limited action is having no obvious effect on tackling this problem. Inflation is now the key obstacle to stable industrial relations and the future of the partnership process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The talks at social partnership level are attempting to design a package which will restore those living standards which have been eroded by inflation. Those discussions between the social partners are not dealing with the problems of inflation but rather with the consequences of inflation. Inflation makes people poorer. This year inflation has cancelled the 5.5% increase in wages under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the 5% average increase in social welfare payments. Consequently the living standards of those on fixed incomes have been seriously eroded. The current review is in part a response to the demand by workers and social <Col N="817" /> welfare recipients to regain the ground lost through inflation.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last, the Minister for Finance provided little solace when he said that inflation could go higher. The argument between the social partners is not whether inflation should be tackled but rather how it should be done. A package of measures containing pay elements, tax concessions and better social services must be designed to compensate for the falling living standards. We all agree with this. Whatever is done must be done in such a way that it does not fuel inflation. This will not be an easy task but it is preferable to the widespread unrest and a reduction in competitiveness which would result from an extended bout of wages chasing prices.</P>
    <P>The key to resolving inflation and the knock-on industrial unrest is resolving the supply bottlenecks. Fine Gael believes the Government should establish a supply task force comprising Government agencies with a mandate to increase the supply of domestically produced products and services that impact on the CPI. It will be noted from this week's inflation figures that the service industry is still running at an inflation rate of 7%, which is above the average 6.2% throughout the CPI. This task force would identify changes in legislation and public administration and, as a matter of urgency, would examine areas where the rates of price increase exceed the norm, giving priority to factors determined within Ireland and under our control, such as housing. Another issue would be the resourcing of the Competition Authority and ensuring the staff are put in place to combat anti-competitive practices. I hope the necessary resources can be put in place in the Competition Authority and that it will have its proper complement of staff. Given that its staffing levels are one-third down I hope some progress can be made in that area. Such a supply side task force would produce concrete proposals for legal and administrative changes to increase the supply of goods and services on an emergency basis. The legal changes needed could be prioritised and fast-tracked through this and the other House. This is fundamental to the continuation of partnership which we have had for over a decade and the development of a type of co-operative legislation which we have before us today. It is important to be aware of that. It is due to the partnership process and the co-operative framework that has existed over recent years that this legislation is before the House. We do not want to see that being threatened in the future. The kernel issue now is inflation and it must be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the result of the March 1999 report of the high level group. The genesis of its recommendations was the issue of trade union recognition in the Ryanair and Nolan Transport disputes. The group had the advantage of the Supreme Court judgment in the Nolan Transport case as well as the report of the inquiry into the Ryanair dispute at Dublin Airport. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty in his Supreme Court judgment in the <Col N="818" /> Nolan Transport <i>v.</i> SIPTU case accepted that trade union recognition disputes fall within the definition of a trade dispute as provided for in industrial relations legislation. He said that employers have an obligation to accord trade unions a measure of respect as representatives on behalf of the rights of workers.</P>
    <P>That was an important judgment and Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty should be given recognition for it. Sadly, over the last few months there has been much criticism in the House of Mr. O'Flaherty on a different matter. It is appropriate, however, that we take note of the fundamentally important judgment he made. He should be commended for it.</P>
    <P>The high level group pointed out that the most effective means of resolving differences which arise between employers and trade unions representing employees was by voluntary collective bargaining. When problems arise in cases of dispute where negotiating arrangements are not in place two distinct procedures, as outlined by the Minister, should be brought into play. The first is the voluntary approach which is incorporated into the practice of voluntary dispute resolution by the LRC. Everybody would agree that this is by far the best avenue for resolving such disputes. The Bill outlines a second avenue which should be used only as a last resort and will, hopefully, not be invoked with great frequency.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the Minister's point that the LRC chairs over 2,000 meetings per annum, four fifths of which result in cases being resolved by conciliation. The unresolved issues go to the Labour Court where 80% of them are resolved through non-binding judgments. The remaining approximately 4% of disputes cause the difficulty which this legislation and the voluntary code of practice address. Hopefully, there will be a resolution of some of these cases through the voluntary code of practice. The threat of binding recommendations, provided for in this legislation, should also ensure a reduction in the number of those cases. It is hoped that many of these disputes can be resolved without recourse to this legislation. That would be, by far, the best course to take.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines the procedures to be followed should an employer refuse to participate in the voluntary code of practice. The Labour Court will have power to make binding recommendations. It can investigate the matter and make recommendations on foot of its investigations. If there is no agreement on such recommendations, the Labour Court can make a determination which is binding for 12 months and, as the Minister pointed out, the matter can go before the Circuit Court. This is the cornerstone of the Bill which, it is hoped, will address the issues raised by the Ryanair and Nolan Transport disputes.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with situations where there is no domestic mechanism to deal with disputes and where the employer and trade union involved have not put in place a structure to deal with agreements and negotiations. We cannot stand by <Col N="819" /> a situation where a company can be brought to its knees because one side refuses to put in place structures to deal with difficulties. If an employer, for example, refuses to put in place a structure to bring about a domestic remedy, either party or the court can intervene to resolve that problem through the mechanisms in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that there is a certain onus on the trade unions as well. Sadly, difficulties among unions have become a more common problem in recent disputes, for example, in the threatened ESB dispute, the Aer Lingus dispute and the Irish Rail dispute. That gives rise to questions in relation to social partnership and unions recognising other unions and their negotiating rights which must be resolved. ICTU has a responsibility and role to play in that regard. It is fundamentally important that issues such as this do not prolong industrial disputes. The Minister has his work cut out in that regard.</P>
    <P>Rivalry between unions and employers can be tackled and resolved with this legislation but this other problem has now raised its head. It is not covered by the Bill but it is of fundamental importance to successful industrial relations. The problem must be nipped in the bud and not allowed to generate more serious disputes as time passes. In the past eight months we have seen it cause two disputes and one threatened dispute. These questions must be resolved and mechanisms must be put in place through ICTU to resolve them and ensure the efficient running of our labour relations mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The focus of disputes and the sector where the greatest problems have arisen is the indigenous private sector. This sector is key to the success of these new negotiating mechanisms and I hope consultation took place with the sector.</P>
    <P>An issue which has been highlighted in the media over the last 24 hours was raised by me with the Minister last Thursday. The issue is the abuse of the rights of foreign workers. They are not given the same entitlements under employment legislation as other workers. I have been informed of a situation where Irish employees in a certain company are allowed to join a union but foreign workers are not. The abuse of the Employment Agency Act highlights one problem with regard to immigrants but, sadly, it is only the tip of the iceberg. I believe many more abuses of employment legislation dealing with minimum wages, working time directives and so forth are occurring. These workers are being abused. They are not aware of their rights because the system is not properly policed due to inadequate resources. The workers are also threatened with the loss of their jobs if they do complain.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Tánaiste's argument this morning that this has nothing to do with the work permit legislation. It is fundamental to that legislation. Unless it is implemented when the immigrants arrive in this country, it will be extremely difficult to enforce other legislation. Some type of tracking mechanism must be put in place. In <Col N="820" /> addition, under the work permit legislation an employee must stay with an employer for 12 months. That, in itself, is leading to some of the abuses of employment legislation because if an employee loses his or her job, he or she might have to return to his or her native country. These people cannot afford that. If they have had to pay, as has been alleged, up to three years' salary to come to Ireland, they cannot afford to lose their jobs and be sent home. This will result in Ireland having a bad reputation in the future in relation to the treatment of foreign nationals. It will also mitigate against the recruitment of foreign nationals to the detriment of the economy, given that we need the services of these people.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out this problem under this legislation because it is causing huge friction within the workplace. There are now two sets of rules for employees. The employment legislation is enforced in relation to Irish and European employees who have union representation and can lobby management. Foreign workers do not have union representation and those who do are often threatened with the loss of their jobs. These employees are doing double and treble shifts, which reduces the amount of work available for Irish workers. Some employers are fuelling racial tensions within the workplace by stating that one foreign national is three times as good as an Irish worker. If they are being abused and being made to do the work of three people, naturally they are three times as good. This is an abuse of the legislation and is causing friction within the workplace. Staff are now being pushed aside and replaced by foreign nationals. As a result, there have been a number of skirmishes and minor disputes throughout the country. Unless this problem is nipped in the bud, there could be serious industrial relations and racial problems in the workplace, the knock-on effect of which would be that people would not come to this country.</P>
    <P>A working group should be set up to look at the enforcement of the current employment and industrial relations legislation, including this Bill, to see if there are loopholes employers are using to keep foreign employees from coming under the terms of the legislation. Even though everyone is supposed to be treated equally, because these employees are not aware of their rights, they cannot have them enforced or complain about them. If they complain, they may lose their jobs and have to leave the country. This is a fundamental issue which needs to be resolved if we are to ensure these employees are protected, that the jobs of Irish employees are protected and that we do not have industrial relations disputes arising out of this friction in the workplace. That is of no benefit to any individual, company or the reputation of this country abroad.</P>
    <P>This is progressive legislation which is not to be found on the Statute Books of many countries in the European Union, including the United Kingdom. To the best of my knowledge, neither are such structures in place in the United States. In that context, the legislation is a positive <Col N="821" /> development. It shows the partnership that exists in this country and how far we have come in relation to the industrial relations mechanism. It highlights our maturity in being able to do business without conflict or confrontation. This goes back to the progression of partnership agreements over the years. Since I came into the workplace, there have not been very many industrial disputes. I probably come from a generation to whom industrial disputes are rather unique. However, this was not the case 20 or 30 years ago when there were serious industrial relations problems. This was the case even up to ten or 12 years ago. It is great that there has been such a turn around and that this legislation is at the cutting edge in this regard within the European Union.</P>
    <P>While the Minister of State's party is questioning participation and enlargement within the European Union, it is of fundamental importance that we remain part of the EU and ensure that new legislation is introduced which will lay the common ground throughout the EU in relation to employment and trade. Where there are 15 different pieces of legislation throughout the European Union, whether employment legislation, industrial relations legislation or whatever, this is a disincentive to the development of Irish industry in Europe and production processes in this country. The Minister of State has a role to play in ensuring this type of legislation is taken on board by other member states and that all employment legislation is streamlined throughout the European Union. I hope he will take a more progressive and positive attitude towards participation within the EU than some of his more senior ministerial colleagues. As a good west of Ireland man, I am sure he will take this attitude because the European Union has been good to the west of Ireland. It is important that we question aspects of EU legislation but it is also important that there is streamlining of regulations and legislation throughout the EU, rather than the critical approach taken by some Ministers in relation to this issue, which is a key element to the success of the common market.</P>
    <P>The key element to the success of this Bill will be a partnership structure and a commitment from both sides to review its implementation. This will help to resolve many anomalies which may arise. It is a positive development that there is agreement to have a continuous review of the legislation. Perhaps we should consider having more ongoing reviews of legislation. The situation which was highlighted in this House last Thursday and in the past couple of days may not have arisen if there had been ongoing reviews of the legislation which is 30 years old. I hope it will not be 30 years before this legislation is reviewed. I hope also it will not have to be implemented.</P>
    <P>This is a positive development. I hope the Minister of State will address some of the points I have raised, which may not relate specifically to the Bill. However, they are important issues which come within the Minister of State's brief <Col N="822" /> and which need to be resolved if we are to have a stable industrial relations environment in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the Minister of State or the House no disrespect when I say I cannot work up any great enthusiasm about the legislation. To be honest, it is neither here nor there. I am a member of a trade union. I worked for what was then the ITGWU, now SIPTU, and I am still a member of that union. I do not know if that constitutes a vested interest. The Bill is not of any great moment. It has an extremely limited, narrow focus and is unlikely to leave any perceptible mark on the industrial relations landscape except perhaps in extreme cases which might only be worsened by this legislation.</P>
      <P>Before I discuss the Bill, I want to take up Deputy Naughten's remark on social partnership. I am somewhat surprised given what is happening currently that the Minister of State made almost no comment in his contribution about social partnership and the strains and stresses it is enduring. He stated: &ldquo;The strains that are currently in evidence have much to do with managing our economic growth and our growing expectations&rdquo;. I hope that is not the full thrust of the Government's assessment of what is wrong because that is too glib and facile. It is more serious than that and it is not just about managing our success, economic growth and increased expectations.</P>
      <P>The big winner as a result of economic growth over the past seven years has been employment creation. The significant gain is that almost 600,000 more people are at work than in 1992. Governments and others ought not to draw the conclusion that because of that fantastic expansion in employment, individual workers are proportionately better off; they manifestly are not. In some cases workers have done quite well and the Minister of State, at least in private discussion, will frankly admit that others did much better than the terms of successive national agreements, including the present one. That to a large extent reflects the tightening of the labour market and the fact that employers must be prepared to pay to retain skilled, semi-skilled and key people. I suspect that is a significant factor in wage increases.</P>
      <P>However, unfortunately all sectors in the economy do not perform evenly and people are caught in less profitable industries and menial employment on low pay. Certain elements of service industries do not pay well. How many of the Minister of State's esteemed estimable senior civil servants knew about the situation at Aer Lingus? Did he know it was that bad? I am ashamed to admit I did not know that people in what used to be prestigious employment are being paid the buttons we learned about this week. It is quite an embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent it demonstrates the folly that happens frequently in industrial relations of patching up a dispute to get over the particular <Col N="823" /> hump at the time. This legislation patches up something else and I am not sure that the end product advances the cause of human harmony a great deal. The management at Aer Lingus has admitted that it has a fundamental problem of low pay. That does not relate to managing our economic success or people's expectations. I am absolutely fascinated.</P>
    <P>The average Member of this House is not paid commensurate with the job he must do but we are well paid by comparison to the workers in Aer Lingus to whom I listened on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier this week. One cannot ascribe to them great expectations. It is a perennial puzzle for me to understand how they make ends meet because they rent houses, have mortgages and try to run a car. Social partnership is under greater stress than the Minister of State's casual reference implies.</P>
    <P>The second possible explanation for that reference is that he knows well what I am saying is right and he does not want to refer to it because it will open a hornet's nest. However, this House is the place to discuss the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to because I agree with many of the Deputy's comments but I focused on the legislation in my contribution. It is not the most exciting Bill as it is pretty mechanical. I agree the Deputy is raising real issues but we should discuss them on another occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister of State's point. However, the House is the place to discuss these issues. One of the interesting aspects of the diminution of the stature of this Parliament is that between the impact of the European Union on the one hand and social partnership on the other the role of this House has been diminished as a result.</P>
      <P>If the Government argues that social partnership is the cornerstone of our economic success it must be nurtured, worked at, guided, and invested in if it is to survive this rickety period. The House is the place to do that because social partnership is not just about the corporate state meeting at the top level and saying that senior personnel in the trade union movement, the employer's organisations and in the Minister's Department are all agreed that in an ideal world the formula should be whatever. That need not necessarily be the perception on the ground and we have made little enough progress translating social partnership from that level into the workplace. We need to return to that.</P>
      <P>Inflation is a big factor in all of this. If one is not on low pay similar to some Aer Lingus employees, one finds that in the present environment the first phase of the PPF has been eliminated as a result of inflation. I hope the eminent tax reductions will make a contribution to the overall value of the social wage but nonetheless the first increment has been obliterated by inflation and that is a major issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not agree with him on everything but I did on that. Anything which involves a high level group brings out the same reaction in me. The Minister of State came into the House and because the high level group agreed a number of principles, the suggestion is how could anyone in Dáil Éireann have the audacity to raise any questions about something agreed by a high level group. However, I question it because the point at which the debate started was the need to deal with the problem of trade union recognition. Whatever the Bill before the House today contains, it does not deal with trade union recognition.</P>
      <P>I was amused by a bloomer in the Minister of State's script that got past the vigilant Civil Service. The sentence taken straight from the Seanad debate on the word processor states &ldquo;Senators will recall that the Labour Party introduced the trade union recognition Bill&rdquo;. I read the debate involving the eminent Members of the more reflective Chamber and it did not rise to its usual great heights, with the exception of the contribution of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, who was immensely enthusiastic. However, he was wearing an even more partisan hat than me.</P>
      <P>The paragraph imported directly on the word processor from the Seanad debate talked about the Labour Party Bill on trade union recognition, and this was the point. It was a Bill about trade union recognition; that was the purpose of our legislation. My colleague, Deputy Broughan, will undoubtedly point out the significant meaningful differences between the Bill the Labour Party introduced and the watered down, pale imitation, which is full of loopholes and escape hatches, that is now before the House. This is the first point I wish to make. This is not a trade union recognition Bill because it does not provide for recognition of trade unions or free collective bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be the official view that this is not a great problem in any event in the sense that the law protects the worker who wishes to join a trade union and if a worker does not wish to join a trade union, there is no problem. Obviously, trade unions have a vested interest in this matter and if a case similar to that involving Ryanair <Col N="825" /> happens, they kick up a fuss and we will be seen to respond to it. However, even if the penetration of trade unions diminishes significantly, it is not a great issue for society.</P>
    <P>I hold a different view and I confessed my partisan interest earlier. It is interesting to consider the history of trade union penetration in Ireland in recent years. It has seriously diminished and trade unions probably do not do their cause any good by seeming to deny that this is the case because numbers have more or less remained static. However, in density terms, the percentage organisation has seriously declined. Around 1980 the percentage trade union penetration in the country was approximately 62%. It is now marginally below 40%. The view that numbers in unions have apparently remained static does not accord with the fact, given the expansion of the work force</P>
    <P>This is a matter of concern and it is not desirable to have a trade union movement that predominantly comprises the public sector or certain traditional or low paid categories of workers. This is why there is a need for legislation dealing with trade union recognition &ndash; if we are to take the legislative route &ndash; but whatever is before the House, it is not a trade union recognition Bill. This legislation is designed to facilitate the containment of disputes that might arise in an employment because of dissatisfaction with pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>Trade union disputes can happen for reasons that have nothing to do with pay and conditions, but that is not provided for in the Bill. The legislation is designed to contain industrial conflict. It is not designed to facilitate the recognition of trade unions. The Minister of State quoted Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty in the Nolan case, but there is another quote from Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in that case which is pertinent to this aspect. He said:</P>
    <P>Employers have an obligation to accord trade unions a measure of respect, representing as they do the rights of the workers. An unfortunate aspect of the present case is that the employers appear to have approached it on the basis that either all the workers joined the trade union or none of them joined, and that decision was to be made by the majority of the workers.</P>
    <P>This situation can and does arise and I am not sure that this Bill will help it appreciably.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State's comments in respect of the voluntarist nature of our industrial relations machinery. Unless there is a good reason, I am not in favour of further and ongoing legislative intervention. If there is legislative intervention, it must be for a precise and meaningful purpose and not because it is a patch up job to facilitate demands from one or other side of the social interests. This is what is involved here. Whereas trade unions are making an effort to address the new type of worker and the new type of company being attracted to this economy <Col N="826" /> in terms of offering a different range of services, a different type of membership and a different nature of service back-up, they are naturally concerned, as I am, about the diminishing rate of trade union recruitment.</P>
    <P>They have been frustrated, as they were outrageously, in the case of Ryanair. In that dispute, it was agreed to build on the work of the high level group and the opposite of trouble shooters were sent in to resolve it. There was no appreciable effect and the Bill will have the same outcome from the trade union point of view. There will not be an appreciable effect. The provisions of the legislation will not come into effect unless the employer has been found in good faith to have failed to comply with the terms of the voluntary code. If that happens, that are four very serious requirements in terms of what must be complied with by the trade union side in particular before the gravamen of the Bill might be invoked.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) states:</P>
    <P>the trade union or the excepted body or the employees, as the case may be, have not had recourse to industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of such code of practice.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the thrust of the Bill, in all events industrial action must be avoided. There is a specific requirement here to ensure that there was no recourse to industrial action after the dispute was referred to the commission. There is nothing in the section or the Bill that acknowledges that some employers would be prepared, as Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair would be, to provoke a dispute that has apparently nothing to do with the original issues that gave rise to the dispute. That situation is not provided for in the Bill. The legislation is framed in the mentality of normal, sensible employers doing business with normal, reasonable trade unions. There is, however, nothing sensible, reasonable or rational about trade union recognition disputes. There is a great deal of bad blood and determination on the part of the employer that he or she will not permit trade union organisations or deal with a trade union which in many cases may even represent a majority of workers. Nowadays, sophisticated avoidance techniques are built in to ensure that trade unions are kept out.</P>
    <P>A particularly bloody-minded dispute is usually the only one of this genre that comes into the public domain. The legislation is framed to assume the normal, rational, sensible impulses of the good employer, but that is not the kind of situation we are dealing with. Section 5(2) states that &ldquo;a recommendation under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall not provide for arrangements for collective bargaining&rdquo;. It is crystal clear, but from the point of view of the trade union movement I am not sure why they want this Bill. The Minister is providing an avenue of resolution in respect of pay and conditions for an aggrieved employee or <Col N="827" /> group of employees. The Bill expressly denies trade union recognition and collective bargaining, which are the issues the Labour Party set out to address. In many ways it is more likely that the legislation will lead to litigation.</P>
    <P>We will go through the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage when, I wish to advise the Minister, we will be tabling a number of amendments. As one goes through the Bill one can see the loopholes as well as the hurdles that must be jumped by a trade union before it has the ultimate access to the Labour Court for a binding recommendation. These loopholes would invite a bloody-minded employer to litigate if he fails at that stage and, thus, have his way in the end.</P>
    <P>It would almost have been better to leave the situation as it was. While we have already discussed the fact that the Constitution does not oblige an employer to recognise or negotiate with a trade union, recognition disputes have been recognised and facilitated by the courts. Most clever trade unions would always build such a dispute on another issue and it would not transparently be described as a recognition dispute. They would have the dispute on the issue of pay or conditions. Nonetheless, the courts have recognised and facilitated that process in some fairly high profile cases. In that situation, a union with a substantial number of employees in membership would rarely be denied success. Therefore, to some extent, we are legislating for the exception and I am not so sure that is to the advantage of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I will refer to certain cases in more detail on Committee Stage. I well remember cases such as Abbott and Whelan and the ITGWU, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there is a constitutional right to be represented by a union in the conduct of negotiations with employers, in my opinion, could not be sustained. There is no duty placed on an employer to negotiate with any particular citizen or body of citizens.</P>
    <P>That line ran through a number of judgments and it is well accepted that there is no such obligation. However, it has also been established that there is no difficulty in terms of a recognition dispute. The courts have held that disputes over recognition are valid trade disputes.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990, distinguishes disputes over recognition immunity from &ldquo;action in relation to any tortuous act committed by or on behalf of the trade union in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute provided they comply with certain stated statutory requirements&rdquo;. So even the 1990 Act which tightened up this matter did not outlaw that situation.</P>
    <P>We must tease out a number of detailed questions on Committee Stage before we can validate whether this legislation has merit. There are many practical questions to which I do not know the answers at this stage. If a relatively small number of workers joins a union in a substantial <Col N="828" /> employment, could we ever get to the situation where the binding determination would issue? If 30 employees in a company employing 600 joined a trade union, would a court be prepared to issue a legally binding determination in such circumstances? It seems it would have to tread very warily indeed and, to some extent, that defeats the purpose. We built some figures and proportions into our Bill, which seem desirable and sensible. Employers as well as trade unions can take industrial action. What will happen if during the process an employer suspends or locks out an employee or employees suspected of having joined a union?</P>
    <P>The argument advanced for this Bill is that it is the outcome of discussions between both sides of industry and that as a result of that it is selfevidently a good thing. I am not sure that in practice it will turn out that way. The voluntarist character of our industrial relations machinery has served us well. The least legislative intervention is desirable unless it has a manifest purpose. The purpose here is vague and has shifted from where we started. It may well invite litigation in the kind of bloody-minded situation I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill strengthens our industrial relations legislation, extends existing legislation to give the Labour Court new powers to settle disputes in circumstances where parties have not engaged in talks and sets up various mechanisms to deal with such disputes. However, before dealing in detail with the specific proposals in the Bill, I wish to make some broader comments on the need to strengthen and modernise industrial relations within the social partnership model.</P>
      <P>Great economic progress has been made since 1987. Recent statistics have shown that unemployment has fallen to 4.3%. Only 74,000 people were unemployed in the second quarter of this year and 27,000 of those were long-term unemployed. No one would ever have believed that we would see such low figures. I am convinced that we are now on target and it is Government policy to eliminate long-term unemployment in the lifetime of the Government. However, the question should be asked why we have been able to make such strong economic progress over a period of 13 years. In 1987 Government borrowing was running at over 11%, unemployment was 20% and there was zero growth in the economy. Emigration was a daily fact of life for the vast majority of families on this island. We now have one of the strongest economies in Europe and have reversed the historic tide of emigration. Inward investment into Ireland is now stronger than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key reason we have been able to make such strong economic progress over the past 13 years is the existence of social partnership agreements. Many other European Governments look <Col N="829" /> at Ireland with envy when they see such strong social partnership agreements in place covering a wide range of social and economic issues, including pay, for periods of up to three years. In other EU countries, bilateral negotiations between individual trade unions and the Government are normal practice. However, they do not lead to a lowering of industrial unrest but heighten the prospect of it.</P>
    <P>Since the first social partnership agreement in 1987, we have worked very hard together to define social partnership and to deal with new priorities and challenges. The current Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is no different in that respect. Over the past 13 years, partnership agreements have provided us with the framework for moving together to achieve real progress and have helped us break out of damaging short-term reactions to complex issues.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness reflects how far we have come and it is both innovative and ambitious. The awareness of past achievements should give us the energy to address outstanding problems and reach the new targets which are at the heart of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We need to maintain our focus on those ambitious goals in areas such as child care, poverty, transport, life-long learning and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach stated in his address to the social partners during the summer, each social partnership agreement since 1987 has challenged us in different ways. With each of them we found ourselves tackling new imperatives and priorities. That situation has not changed and no doubt it never will. In implementing the agreed frameworks for prosperity, social inclusion and equality and the successful adaptation to continuing change, we need to remember the lessons learned from the past partnership experience. We are a small open economy in an increasing global market. Our behaviour as economic and social actors affects others just as the interplay of taxation, spending, investment, consumption, wages, productivity and employment go to shape the reality of life in Ireland. Consistency and co-operation will, therefore, always produce more than conflict and confusion.</P>
    <P>It is this latter point I wish to address. I am saddened that industrial unrest is increasing in Ireland. I hope that, in the discussions between the Government, trade unions and employer groups, a situation can be reached whereby industrial unrest can be lowered soon. I am confident the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness lays down the key parameters within which industrial unrest can be lowered.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a further step in modernising our industrial relations within the social partnership model. The legislation has emerged from recommendations of a high level group comprising the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. This high level group was established under Partnership 2000 to consider the detailed proposals <Col N="830" /> submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions, the right to bargain and the IBEC position on the impact of these proposals. This was in the context of the partnership commitment to modernise our industrial relations procedures and institutions. The high level group agreed that where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences which arise between employers and trade unions representing employees is by voluntary collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>This Bill will ensure that a voluntary procedure can be put in place whereby parties can avail of the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to assist in the resolution of disputes over pay and conditions. When negotiating agreements are not in place, and where collective bargaining fails to take place, the following process can be activated. In the first instance, the matter is referred to the Labour Relations Commission which will appoint an officer from its advisory service to assess the issue in dispute. The officer will then work with the parties in an attempt to resolve the issues. In the event that the issues are not capable of an early resolution by this intervention, an agreed cooling off period shall be put in place. During this cooling off period, the Labour Relations Commission advisory service will continue to work with the parties in an attempt to resolve any outstanding issues. The commission may engage expert assistance including the involvement of ICTU and IBEC, should that prove helpful in the resolution of any differences.</P>
    <P>In the event of issues remaining unresolved, the Labour Relations Commission shall make a written report to the Labour Court on the matter. The Labour Court shall consider the position of the employer groups and the trade unions and shall issue recommendations on any outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>A special fallback procedure is provided for whereby the Labour Court can investigate an issue in dispute between a trade union and an employer where the court is satisfied that an employer has failed to follow the voluntary procedure, where the appropriate internal procedures and mechanisms have failed to resolve the issue, and where there is no recourse to industrial action during the process. The Labour Court shall conduct an investigation into the matter in dispute taking into account the integrity and totality of the labour relations practices operated in the company and shall issue a recommendation.</P>
    <P>I support the key provisions in this Bill which is innovative and which will modernise our industrial relations legislation. The Bill will help minimise industrial unrest and focuses on the need for voluntary agreement for dispute resolution which is sensible and correct. I earlier recalled the Taoiseach's comments when he said consistency and co-operation will always produce more than conflict and confusion. The Taoiseach is right and proper in his general analysis as to how to address particular social and economic problems. This can <Col N="831" /> also be transcended into the matter of dispute settling in a labour relations context.</P>
    <P>Our labour relations machinery has worked well for many years. However, legislation governing the operation of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court needs to be updated from time to time and the Bill we are discussing updates the present industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this important legislation. Industrial relations is important in the year of the millennium. We have a booming economy and there is a perception that people can demand any level of wage increase. This Bill will give the Labour Court new powers to settle disputes in cases where an employer has failed to follow agreed voluntary procedures, where negotiating procedures and collective bargaining are not taking place, and where there has been no recourse to industrial action by the trade union or the employees. However, the Bill is very confined.</P>
      <P>The services sector will be the largest contributor to growth in employment up to 2010. The retail sector is the largest segment of this sector accounting for 11% of employment in the economy. Up to 50,000 new jobs have been created in the services sector in the past two years which indicates the role this sector is playing. There is little recourse to the Labour Court in this significant sector of employment. However, the PPF takes little account of this sector and the sector was not represented in the forum which drafted the agreement. It was disappointing that such a significant segment of the economy played no major role in that process.</P>
      <P>The services sector, particularly the retail sector &ndash; hotels and restaurants &ndash; has created significant wealth. Dealing with customers and quality of service have given Ireland a competitive image. I welcome the introduction of the minimum wage but employers are paying well beyond that figure. I was amazed to discover that cabin crew in Aer Lingus, which is a high risk job, receive wages which are only slightly above the minimum wage. People had a different perception of the wages earned by such workers.</P>
      <P>The education system frowns on business. Some parents feel their children are above working in the retail sector, such as in hotels, supermarkets or other niche services which contribute so much to the economy. The education system should seriously examine the role of business in the economy and the issue of dealing with customers. The growth of e-commerce is also important. We must never lose sight of the customer and we must build up and promote the services sector, cross-Border trade and such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care and lifelong learning are also important elements of industrial relations. The cost of child care reflects on industrial relations within a company. Industrial relations is about communicating with employees whether in large <Col N="832" /> or small companies. Major recent disputes have all involved large companies. We need large companies but small companies employing ten to 15 people have played an important role and have been successful. Disputes in such companies rarely reach the national press as they are resolved within the company and without recourse to adjudication or the additional powers being given to the Labour Court. People do not have to go down that road.</P>
    <P>We must value the important role played by small companies which work 40-hour weekends to maintain their services. Retailers, manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and consumers influence the make-up of the big retail chains. It is important that there are good retailers, manufacturers and suppliers as they are all critical to the supply chain, and the area of distribution and logistics has changed considerably. The consumers are most important. These days consumers working for the big industrialists are aware of the bigger picture and expect more.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be careful about making statements that the economy is booming because these accelerate people's demands for wage increases. It is important that there is a minimum wage but it is also important to make clear, as I did, that workers do not receive the minimum wage because they must pay tax. The minimum wage for a 40 hour week is £176 but the employee might receive only £152. The perception given was that the worker would receive the minimum wage after tax. When the minimum wage was introduced it should have been clear that it related to gross earnings and there is a huge difference between gross and net earnings. That misunderstanding put huge pressure on employers paying the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour and it is being topped up also. In certain cases, that created huge unrest among workers in small companies. My employees felt entitled to receive the minimum wage of £176. The use of the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; should have been looked at.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give powers to the Labour Court to adjudicate in industrial disputes where companies refuse to follow the normal voluntary procedures or fail to deal in good faith with trades union or staff representatives. Its provisions are in line with the deliberations of the Government's high-level group on trades union recognition but, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, the Bill does not deal with trades union recognition.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has been welcomed by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation. It is important that there is trades union recognition in certain companies but it is not needed in every company. It depends on the structure of the company. Mr. Finbarr Flood, who is chairman of the Labour Court, stated that he was happy to take on the extra responsibilities contained in this legislation. He said the new role of the court has been clearly defined and he is confident that it can carry out the new tasks.</P>
    <P>In the past year there have been huge disputes such as the SIPTU baggage handlers dispute at <Col N="833" /> Ryanair in 1998, when Dublin airport closed and the dispute this week. This should not happen in this day and age when there are all these facilities.</P>
    <P>People say they were unaware of the wages at Aer Lingus. All of these people were paid extraordinarily high salaries but in any company it is all about good PR. It is no good having good PR at the top level in a company. It is important that everyone is treated equally. For instance, the customer who comes in the door of your establishment and spends £20 should be treated equally and entitled to the same facilities. The problem here is that unfortunately people were not given the information which should be made available to every employee. They should be aware of their wage scale and the possibility of getting increases.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties because different trades unions are involved such as MANDATE and SIPTU which are growing their business to an extent by exploiting the market and using the staff as scapegoats. It is regrettable. If there is competition for membership among the trades union, it should not be fought out at the expense of the customer. People who had planned to fly out of Dublin Airport on Tuesday had their flights cancelled and that is bad for business. It gives the wrong signal.</P>
    <P>Everybody is concerned at the rate of unofficial disputes. With a booming economy in which inflation has certainly taken hold again, there is a responsibility on all of us, as elected Members of this House, but the acceleration in inflation has been caused in many cases by people being greedy and stating that they want more. People on high salaries feel they are entitled to more. They should decide that wage restraint is important, but we must ensure that people on low incomes get an increase. People on high salaries should not look for massive increases and additional holidays. All of these increases should be capped.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was critical of employers for failing to spend more on training considering employees are their most valuable resource. I realise that, like me, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, empathises with businesses. I am glad to hear that she is critical, but she should be critical not of employers but of her Department.</P>
    <P>An employer's greatest asset is his employees. We all hear of bank loans invested in machinery, new vans and equipment but the single biggest investment an employer makes is in his employees because their salaries are a huge investment. Although this may not be the case in larger companies, in small companies employers are not facilitated in giving training to employees. Often this creates uncertainty for the employee, who experiences a diminished sense of value within the company. At present employees are walking out of jobs. Last week a butcher, who was getting £250 after tax as a trainee in my company, told me that he had been offered another job at £300 a week. People have such choice at present and that is what one is up against. He said <Col N="834" /> the other job will suit him better because it will be more convenient. He was in an apprenticeship with FÁS and he received the proper training in Galway. He is leaving the butcher trade to take up a job as a labourer on a building site because he will get more money. That is why I feel that inflation is being fuelled by uncertainty. If the Department would allow expenditure on training, such as ISO courses or training modules at the regional colleges, which are empty in the evening, to be written off against tax, it would make the employees feel that they could get recognition and accreditation for their retail services skills. That would make people feel they had a worthwhile career.</P>
    <P>As there are such differing perceptions about professions at present, there is a need to emphasise that a career dealing with the consumer is worthwhile. These jobs involve great skill and demand ability. Unfortunately there are certain jobs which are perceived as far more worthwhile than others.</P>
    <P>A good industrial relations environment is essential if we are to maintain the current level of economic success. Last year's figure of some 215,000 production days lost was the highest since 1990. This occurred in a booming economy. There is a very clear message in that. People are totally unsettled and we have, in many cases, lost the run of the economy. Banks are dishing out money. I know of people who are being given 125% mortgages to buy houses. Credit card companies are dishing out money. We are talking about an economy in which people are not prudent with the money they are getting. There is an inflation rate of 6% or 7%, which is very worrying. People earning £300 or £400 per week do not have any more in their pockets than when they were earning £200 per week. People are being extraordinarily extravagant and are not managing money prudently.</P>
    <P>A review of the industrial relations machinery is very important because our industrial relations performance, with some notable exceptions, has been outstanding. The economy's success is based, on a large part, on our ability to reach agreement by consensus, but frequently negotiations have been lengthy. The decade ahead is likely to see a pace of change which will accelerate and make flexibility and speed of response essential requirements in business.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. The Labour Court is very important. Before people go into strike mode, they should first go through all the procedures. Unfortunately, it is used as a last resort in certain cases. What happened in Dublin Airport this week was regrettable. It is regrettable that people take, or feel they have to take, that route. This is a small economy with 3.5 million people and we have wonderful opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in business, small business in particular, which is very important in small towns and villages. Small companies demonstrate dedication, commitment and perseverance. <Col N="835" /> Employers, in certain cases, are the lowest paid. They believe in the service they are giving, they are not out to make megabucks, to go on two holidays per year or to work a 30 hour week. They work weekends and are the last to be paid. There is a perception that employers are taking much of the cash but they pay their employees, tax and expenses first and when the final accounts are done, more often than not, they are the lowest paid in the company.</P>
    <P>This is an economy where, in certain cases, the fat cats in big companies are setting a bad example to employees who are getting £10,000 to £12,000 per annum. We must share and there must be a return for investment, a return for the work one does in a company. In certain cases, unrest has been created by a perception that has been generated, to a degree by Government, that we have a booming economy and that we can all go out and celebrate. We must remember that a large number of people are barely managing to survive &ndash; we must never forget that.</P>
    <P>In small companies, perseverance, dedication and commitment are brought into the ethos of business and the bottom line is to give a service to the consumer. People must always remember that. Those who work for big institutions must fully realise that the customer, who pays all the bills, is the bottom line.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is a pathetic response by the Government to a serious situation in the Irish economy concerning the civil rights of workers to join a trade union, to form a union in their workplace and to require employers to negotiate meaningfully with that union the wages and conditions of the workers concerned. This was originally supposed to be a trade union recognition Bill which would require employers to recognise unions and to deal with the workers who were members of them. What we have here is pathetic legislation so full of holes that rogue employers will continue to laugh all the way to their Ansbacher accounts or wherever they are salting away the gains. The legislation is so full of holes that any attempt to keep it afloat as a means of justice for working people in the face of recalcitrant employers will ignominiously fail &ndash; it will sink ignominiously.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that this legislation arose out of the Ryanair dispute in 1998 when about 40 baggage handlers exercised their civil right to join a trade union and were faced with a hard-line employer who refused to talk to the union, SIPTU, which the workers had joined. That management was so ruthless that it forced those workers into an industrial dispute and forced the closure of Dublin Airport for a period of time. That is the type of employer and management with which this Bill was supposed to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Long Title is an &ldquo;Act to make further and better provisions for promoting harmonious relations between workers and employers.&rdquo;  I am in favour of peace and love also but, unfortu<Col N="836" /> nately, we have to deal with the world in which we find ourselves, the real character and nature of the forces operating in this world and the character and nature of the employers, with whom this Bill is supposed to deal, who are ruthless profit seekers who do not care a fig for the trade union, human or civil rights of workers when such rights conflict with their drive to maximise profits. That is the prevailing system &ndash; the market economy or capitalism, call it what you will.</P>
    <P>If I remember correctly, the Taoiseach at the time of the Ryanair dispute, condemned capitalism that was red in tooth and claw. We do not usually hear language like that from the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats Party in government. So blatant was the activity of the chief executive, who was on £16 million per year, in denying the civil rights of his workers that even our conservative Taoiseach was forced to speak in those terms. This vessel full of holes is supposed to deal with people like that, but there is virtually no sanction as I will go on to show.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in Ryanair at present? There is no trade union apart from that of the pilots who are in IMPACT now. The acid test is whether this Bill would give justice to Ryanair workers who wished to join a trade union, such as the 40 baggage handlers in 1998? There is absolutely no chance that would happen. Their situation under this Bill would be as difficult as the situation they faced following the dispute where scarcely none of them remain in Ryanair because of every trick that was used to get them out of the company, whether by harassment, victimisation or by ending their contracts when they had expired. There is no chance that this Bill would deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>Before we even get into the procedures, the outs are there for the employers. Section 2(1)(f2&gt;a) states that the court may investigate a trade dispute where the court is satisfied that it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute. We have a phenomenon which, in the United States in the days of the wobblies, was called the company union or yellow unions, which are not trade unions but are a kind of smokescreen set up by the employers, drawing in some workers who would be, in many cases, stooges for the management and a small minority of the total complement of staff, to set up what might be called a works committee. The employers then claim that they deal meaningfully with these people and that they engage in collective bargaining negotiations. However, the structures of that committee will often be such that it will not satisfactorily address the grievances of significant sections of the employees. However, if the employees in this case then join a recognised trade union and begin to sue for negotiating rights on their wages and conditions, the <Col N="837" /> employer can claim that the legitimate trade union cannot drag him before the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act, 2000, as he is covered under section 2(1)(<i>a</i>). Furthermore, section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) says with regard to industrial action,</P>
    <P>the trade union or the excepted body or the employees, as the case may be, have not had recourse to industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the Commission </P>
    <P>We want to tie the hands of workers with this legislation while the procedures are gone through.</P>
    <P>However, the length of time it takes for these procedures to be implemented or for the workers to go to the Circuit Court to have them implemented, is so ludicrously long that the cause of the dispute itself will probably be forgotten at that stage. It is quite incredible.</P>
    <P>Section 10 states that:</P>
    <P>Where an employer fails to comply with&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the terms of a determination under <i>section 6</i> within one year from the date on which the determination is communicated to the parties, or . . . an authorised trade union or excepted body may apply to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order.</P>
    <P>The workers would have to wait for one full year after a decision has been handed down. If it is a favourable decision for the workers which vindicates their rights &ndash; which is not always guaranteed from the labour relations machinery &ndash; according to my reading of it, they have to wait a full year before the trade union can go to the Circuit Court to be included on the Circuit Court list which is months long, to compel a rogue employer to implement the terms of the determination in favour of the workers. An employer can appeal a Circuit Court finding to the High Court, so it will go on to the High Court lists resulting in more months of waiting. Two years could pass before the High Court would pronounce on the question put before it by a trade union, two years from the time the determination in favour of workers was first made.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State return to the real world? As he and others are so keen to point out to us, the nature of employment is changing in this society. No longer are people able to slot into or have a job for life or a permanent pensionable position. We are told that we have to be flexible &ndash; what does that mean? It means contracts of six months, a year or 18 months. A group of workers on a six month, nine month or one year contract may go to the labour relations machinery on foot of this legislation and they will all be out the door a full year before there is a final determination, because the boss can end their employment, the contract having run out. It leaves me breathless.</P>

        <b>:</b> I will go further. The percentage of workers in private employment who are trade unionised has fallen since 1987, since the deals between Government, employers and trade union leaders began to be put into effect. There are significant sections of the work force who are not organised in trade unions at the present time. Take the United States multinational companies which are operating in Ireland, for example, in the technological and computer-related sectors. A dramatic percentage of the total US investment by such companies in the EU is concentrated in this country, which is high compared to the percentage of the population of the EU we represent, probably more than 100,000 workers. Many of them are not trade unionised. I ask the Minister to return to the real world and read today's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>under the headline &ldquo;Market takes a pasting, &lsquo;hit by a tidal wave' where it says: &ldquo;An afternoon rally on Wall Street came too late for Dublin, which took a pasting after US stocks fell on fears for the US economy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We operate in a globalised economy as the Government will be quick to point out. What is the position of Irish workers within that globalised economy, those working for multinational companies? They are highly vulnerable to what happens in the US economy and in the world economy. I am not predicting a crash immediately, but it is quite clear that the tremors being felt in the markets in the United States is unfortunately a foretaste of what is to come. Unfortunately, US or any other capitalism cannot and will not continue to grow indefinitely, despite the delusion of some Members of the Government that the Celtic tiger can continue at growth levels of 8, 9 or 10% for the next 25 years.</P>

        <b>: </b>People think that, but unfortunately the iron laws of economic development will assert themselves. We are accused of not wanting this but, socialists want full employment. We are happy when there is full employment because it gives workers the confidence to look for what is rightly theirs within the industrial relations situation, in terms of the share of production that they should receive. We want to see full employment and the confidence in the capacity of workers increased. However, the iron laws of international capitalism will assert themselves, in the saturation of supply where goods will have no further market and therefore, there will be cut backs, retrenchments etc., with a tendency for the rate of profit to fall as a result in some cases. What then will those multinational companies do operating in this economy? They will ruthlessly retrench, cut back, return to their bases and let go thousands of Irish workers who have no union. The workers now, under the pressure of events, want to form a union and they <Col N="839" /> will have to depend on this legislation to vindicate their rights, this legislation which provides that it could take two years before a court could pronounce on a favourable judgment on their behalf at which time the multinational concerned will have gathered itself up and gone to the Far East, far south or anywhere else where its profits will be greater. It is pathetic. We need a real trade union recognition Bill which will recognise the civil rights of workers to form a trade union and would oblige employers to recognise that union and to negotiate with it.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would join IBEC in agreeing this legislation. Clearly, the leadership of the trade union movement has become absolutely toothless. They have become too used to the soft deals that were done between 1987 and the present. We have seen workers lose out again and again and we see it now with the inflation catastrophe.</P>

        <b>:</b> There is no such thing as social partnership. It is a myth. House builders are supposedly the social partners of working people. What kind of partners would double and treble the price of a house in four years and deny their partners the ability to buy a home? Is that partnership? Social partnership is a cover for holding down wages to the minimum while profits, speculative ventures, dividends and rents are allowed to go through the roof uncontrolled. The Government has refused to lift a finger in any meaningful way to control rents and the rip off the so-called partners of the people are getting away with.</P>
      <P>It beggars belief that the trade union leadership agreed to this. What is needed in our industrial relations is a little less corporatism and a little more Larkinism. It is no accident that the Aer Lingus strike burst like a cloud on the Government. I was aware of the rates of pay because I am in touch with the workers who are my constituents but when people became aware of them they were astounded. The Dublin bus strike burst on top of the Government and when people saw the low level of bus drivers' pay they were shocked. That is what so-called social partnership has delivered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the Government parties for coming into the House to hear what I have to say. Deputy Higgins should not make the mistake of confusing the responsibility of Government with the role of the Congress of Trade Unions or the social partners in the discussions they must have. This is a Government Bill and the responsibility for its introduction is that of the Minister and the Government who approved it. Even Jim Larkin and James Connolly were criticised in their time by the predecessors of Deputy Higgins for the necessary compromises they had to make in the course of negotiating with the employers of their time. That is part and parcel of the role of the trade union movement and it should not be confused with the role of Government nor should the inadequacies of legislation introduced by Government be visited on the heads of the leaders of the trade union movement, whose role, after all, was primarily a consultative one prior to the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides a dispute resolution mechanism in circumstances where there has not been collective bargaining between the representatives of employees and an employer. It is certainly not, as my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, said earlier, a trade union recognition Bill. It does not give workers the right to be represented by a trade union or a statutory right of representation before their employer. It seeks to put in place a somewhat long and, in many respects, rather risky procedure for the resolution of disputes. I will <Col N="841" /> return later to the inadequacies of the procedure that is being put in place.</P>
    <P>What is needed at this stage in our industrial relations history and the development of our economy is legislation which gives workers the statutory right to be represented to their employer. It is a cliché to say the world of work has changed quite dramatically over the past 20 years but it has, as has the way in which workers are, and need to be, represented. Twenty years ago, over 60% of the labour force in this country &ndash; which was, admittedly, a smaller labour force at that time &ndash; were in trade unions. It was then the norm for a worker to be in a trade union. Most of those not in trade unions at that time were those in highly paid professional or managerial jobs, people working in family businesses and people working in very small employments where, due to the economies of scale, it was difficult to join a trade union. A handful of large employers were hostile to trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>That has changed quite dramatically today. We now have a situation where, admittedly with a larger workforce and a consequent larger numerical membership of trade unions, the penetration of trade union organisation among the workforce as a whole has declined quite dramatically. It is now less than 40% of the total workforce and is mainly concentrated in public service employment and some of the traditional industries. Only about 25% of the private sector workforce is in trade union membership and about 700,000 private sector workers are not members of any trade union.</P>
    <P>There is a certain image of that labour force that, for the most part, they are highly paid, white coat, IT workers in multinational companies, mainly working for employers who have a culture in their own countries which is not friendly to trade union organisation. However, the evidence belies that. There are only about 100,000 workers in that sector of the economy, many of whom are organised and work for companies with a domestic trade union friendly culture. Therefore, the vast bulk of private sector workers who are not members of a trade union are employed in Irish companies and, for one reason or another, have not chosen to exercise their constitutional right to be a member of a trade union.</P>
    <P>The declining proportion of the labour force who are members of trade unions gives rise to a number of issues which are wider than the rights of individual workers or whether they are individually better off to be in a trade union. The first is the issue of partnership, about which we hear so much. We all accept the social partnership model this country developed over the past decade and a half &ndash; which was based on predecessors such as the old national wage agreements and national understandings which were the norm, for the most part, in this country since the early 1970s &ndash; has made an enormous contribution to the development of our economy. However, we now have a situation where only <Col N="842" /> 25% of the private sector labour force had the right to vote on, for example, the PPF national agreement. Three out of every four workers in the private sector have no opportunity &ndash; by their own choice because they have not joined a trade union &ndash; to vote on the partnership agreement which deals with everything from pay movement to the wider economic and taxation issues. That is seriously unhealthy and one of the weaknesses we will see increasingly in the partnership model. We all have an interest in seeing that put right.</P>
    <P>The second issue which is wider than just the question of the individual worker concerns representation. There are now 700,000 workers in the private sector who do not have a formal means of being represented to their employer. That is a very unwise and, in many ways, irresponsible state to be in. It is like driving without insurance. None of those 700,000 workers would dream of buying a house without having it surveyed by a professional, entering into a contract without having it looked at by a solicitor or buying a second hand car without having a mechanic look it over. However, for the most part, workers in the unorganised sector of the economy, which now includes the vast majority of workers in the private sector, conclude an employment agreement with their employer without anybody looking at it first. They go through their employment without any formal means of representation or having professional advice made readily available to them if something goes wrong. We are talking here about agreements that affect their income, their security, how their mortgage will be paid and their pensions.</P>
    <P>That may be fine at a time when the economy is growing and there is a labour shortage. However, in the last seven or eight years of my time working as a trade union official with the then Irish Transport and General Workers' Union I was responsible for the organisation and unionisation of managerial and professional workers. I do not know how many senior managers I met during my work as a trade union official who had never joined a trade union but who had exactly the same problems as the person on the shop floor the day the notice arrived from North Carolina, or wherever, to say the company was closing down. I met many managers who never thought of joining a trade union but who suddenly found when they were 52 or 53 years of age that the company was getting a new broom and they were no longer needed and were being pushed aside. They needed professional help.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, in this country the trade unions were there to provide assistance, professional skills and advice and, if necessary, negotiating skills to deal with the problems of workers who had chosen not to be in a trade union but who, when the problem arose, decided they needed to join a trade union. In a climate where a declining proportion of private sector workers are trade union members, that option may not continue to exist in its present form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> It is unrealistic to expect that workers who are not in a trade union will not at some point in the longer term find some means of ventilating their grievances. In some cases it may be exercised through people going to lawyers through the development of a form of labour law and negotiating employment contracts which is common in the United States where people go to lawyers. Part of the settlement with the employer ends up with the employer paying the legal costs associated with the processing of the dispute. In some case it may mean groups of workers decide to take some form of protest or agitational type of activity outside the normal trade union negotiations and the use of the industrial relations machinery perhaps in an undisciplined way or in ways that people may not wish to see in the interests of good industrial relations. If the means of being represented by a trade union is frustrated and is not vindicated, workers will find alternative ways of dealing with their employer. They may not be the best ways in their own interests, in the interest of their employment or in the interests of the economy. The reason I make this point is that there is a misunderstanding in regard to what the Ryanair dispute was about.</P>
    <P>The Ryanair dispute is the trigger that sparked this legislation which, in turn, was a response by the Government to the Private Members' Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Broughan. The core issue in the Ryanair dispute was not trade union recognition as traditionally understood. There is the idea that trade union recognition disputes are about the economics of trade unions rather than the rights of workers in many respects. The issue in the Ryanair dispute was about the right to be represented. The workers in Ryanair were seeking a right to be represented by an agency or a body of their choice. The legislation should provide that the individual worker or a group of workers would have a statutory right to be represented in relation to their employment contract by a representative of their choice. For the most part that would be a trade union. That position is not being vindicated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Since I have mentioned the Ryanair dispute and have spoken about it frequently here when the dispute was in progress, this is an opportunity to revisit it. The Ryanair dispute has left industrial relations with two legacies that it will find difficult to deal with. The first legacy is the huge puncture the Ryanair dispute delivered to the concept of partnership. Workers in strong bargaining positions, workers in essential services and those in areas of labour shortages learned a simple lesson from that dispute. We have witnessed examples of this in some of the disputes in the wider public sector area. The lesson learned was simple. If a big employer could use his economic muscle to give the two fingers to partnership, a group of workers in a key area of the economy, if they have the economic and bar<Col N="844" /> gaining muscle, can do likewise. There is increasing evidence of that. It will be increasingly difficult to tell those workers why they should not do it when the State and all its agencies, right up to the Taoiseach, was not able to bring Ryanair's Michael O'Leary to heel.</P>
    <P>The second legacy it has left, and one we are beginning to see in Aer Lingus and will increasingly see in other areas of employment, is that if somebody can come on the scene and say there will be competition for air fares, it is fair game to say there should be competition for trade union membership. The second lesson being learned, one I regret as it will cause enormous difficulties not only for the trade unions but for the entire industrial relations process, is that if you do not get the service you want today from one trade union in relation to a particular dispute you shop around and get it from another. We may see more of that.</P>
    <P>What is required is legislation which gives to workers the statutory right to be represented to their employer in relation to their contract of employment. This Bill does not do that, it expressly excludes that. Section 5(2) states that a recommendation to be made by the Labour Court shall not provide for arrangements for collective bargaining. In other words, it is enshrining in legislation the right of an employer to refuse to negotiate with a representative of the employee's choice. The procedures being set down in this Bill, unless amended, will create enormous difficulties. The first difficulty will be in relation to access to the Labour Court. For a trade union to have access to the Labour Court a group of workers will have to join a trade union but the employer decides not to talk to them. The trade union wants to proceed with whatever grievances, difficulties and claims the workers may have and decides to make a reference to the Labour Court under this Bill. The trade union will have to satisfy a number of conditions which are fraught with danger. It will have to establish that it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations.</P>
    <P>To get over that difficulty all an employer needs is some kind of an uncle Tom &ndash; no offence to the Minister of State &ndash; staff association in place. It can then say that collective bargaining procedures are involved and that it has spoken with the staff association. People who have joined the trade union may well have the view that the staff association involves a crowd of licks who are in the employer's pocket and will not negotiate anything for them, but if there is collective bargaining in the employment there will not be a right of access to the Labour Court. That is my understanding of the Bill as I read it.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the question of the trade union or the employees, as the case may be, acting in a manner which has frustrated the employer observing a provision of a code of practice. That is a wide condition. It remains to be seen how that will be interpreted. Third, neither the trade union nor the employees would have recourse to <Col N="845" /> industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the commission. There could be a situation where a group of, say, 30 or 40 workers in a large employment who have a grievance concerning pay join a trade union but the employer does not speak. The trade union refers the grievance about pay to the Labour Court and asks the Labour Court to deal with it under this legislation. The employer recognises if there is an industrial action in the employment he does not have to have it dealt with by the Labour Court. He provokes a situation whereby industrial action takes place. He makes some unreasonable demand on employees and they refuse to do it, he sacks the shop steward and a group of workers act spontaneously to that form of provocation. This results in industrial action and consequently the right of recourse to the Labour Court is cut off.</P>
    <P>I cannot find in the Bill any provision that obliges the employer to attend the hearings. As a former trade union official, I had some experience of section 21 procedures in the Industrial Relations Act. Under those procedures one brings an employer to the Labour Court on the understanding that, in doing so, one is bound to accept the finding of the court in that case. If the employer does not show up, there is no means of obliging him or her to attend. The Labour Court knows that if it issues a recommendation the union may be bound by it but there is no means of implementing it. Consequently, that influences the type of recommendation that is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my party spokesman, Deputy Naughten, on his contribution this morning. I listened carefully, too, to Deputy Gilmore. I am aware he was a trade union representative before he came into politics and I compliment him on his extensive knowledge of that area.</P>
      <P>I was never in a trade union, having been self-employed all my life. People regularly give out about trade unions and claim they are an unnecessary evil. However, I am glad the trade union movement has been strengthened and that it is now active in many sectors where it was not active in the past. For many years employers treated staff badly, particularly when there were 300,000 people unemployed. Being from the west of Ireland I am familiar with the tourism industry, which did not treat its workers properly. Other speakers referred to supermarkets. We saw how Dunnes Stores and other supermarkets treated their staff and how the unions had to fight for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted there are unions because they are necessary. Recently a factory in Kiltimagh went into liquidation. Everybody was paid except the workers. They were given their statutory entitlements but nothing from the company. The banks had first claim on the funds realised from the sale of the property. The workers were last on the list and to this day I do not know if they were given their due reward by that company. <Col N="846" /> There would have been nobody to fight on their behalf if the union had not been there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill if it will settle disputes. Everybody is aware of the dispute which took place this summer. It went on for ten weeks. During the first few weeks I and some other Members sought to question the Minister about it. She just threw up her hands and said she had no power and could do nothing because it was outside her control. The dispute continued for ten weeks. As a public representative, I came under tremendous pressure from the ordinary people who depended on public transport, particularly the train service, to get to hospitals and go about their business. They had no other means of travelling.</P>
    <P>For ten weeks no trains came to or left the west and nobody did anything about it. There was plenty of talk and media coverage but the dispute continued and the community in the west of Ireland suffered. Of course, if the DART did not run for ten minutes the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and every other Minister would call on Iarnród Éireann, the workers and everybody else concerned to sit down to talks. The greatest negotiator of them all, the Taoiseach, would probably bring them to the round table and the dispute would be settled.</P>
    <P>However, because only the west of Ireland was affected, the rail dispute did not matter. The west did not count. The workers and the people who used the service did not matter. The attitude was, &ldquo;We cannot do anything about it so forget it&rdquo;. The Dublin Bus dispute only lasted a few days and the Minister will remember it well. I thought there had been an earthquake in Dublin. The story was on every radio programme and RTE ran it every hour on the hour as if it was the most awful thing that had ever happened. Yet the people in the west of Ireland had no train service for ten weeks. We do not have the DART, only a bad bus service. Even worse, we have no roads. If we had roads, we would not have been too badly off. There is no road from Longford to Charlestown. It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>However, the attitude was that nothing could be done about the dispute. The Minister said that neither she nor the Government could intervene. I hope we never again see a dispute where so many people's livelihoods were so badly affected. The west of Ireland had a bad tourism season because visitors had no transport. They were planning to use Ireland's public transport system and what happened? The same thing that will happen next Christmas. I can tell the House now what disputes will occur over Christmas.</P>
    <P>Tourists were depending on public transport to get to their hostels and to travel throughout Ireland. Before they arrive here they are notified about their timetables for trains and other services. Their times and programmes were ready but the entire system was disrupted because there was a dispute in the rail service to the west which lasted for ten weeks. The same thing will probably happen this Christmas. The ESB is now talk<Col N="847" /> ing about a dispute. When will the dispute occur? Probably as we approach Christmas. It is a little like Aer Lingus. For the last 20 years there has been a threat of disputes over the Christmas period when thousands of people are travelling to this country from abroad. There is now another threat.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to a just wage and to be represented by their unions. However, there should be a process to deal with disputes. There is the Labour Court and many other such mechanisms but why must there be a strike before these things are settled? Why must the general public always be inconvenienced? If companies foresee a problem and are not prepared to negotiate, this Bill will deal with it. Pressure will be put on both sides to negotiate and try to resolve the dispute without everybody else being hurt first.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of discontent in the country at present. The Government is to blame because it has let inflation get out of control. People were satisfied with the increases they were due under the national wage agreement but not with inflation at 6.2%. The rate will probably increase. Last year I questioned the figures being thrown out by the Central Statistics Office. I questioned the figures in the Dáil and some of the national media picked up the story. It was not popular at the time. People were claiming there was no inflation. I questioned the figures 18 months ago and I was correct. We were not getting the correct figure. We were told that inflation was running at 1% and 2%. The people who were compiling the figures for the Central Statistics Office must not have been buying bread, petrol or diesel. They could not have been shopping in Ireland. If they were, they would have known that prices were going out of control.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance now acknowledges that 6.2% is probably not the correct figure either. He expects it to rise. I hope not for the sake of the economy and the country. The Government should do whatever is necessary in the budget and not frame it with an eye to a general election. I hope this Government, for the first time ever, will put the country first, not Fianna Fáil and the election. The economy has grown, there is plenty of employment and we are doing well. That should not be destroyed by a reckless Government and Minister for Finance. It should not be destroyed by Fianna Fáil using the next budget, because an election is not far away, to get back into power. I hope the Government has the courage to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about Ryanair and there is now a problem in Aer Lingus. While watching RTE the other night, I was amazed at the amount of money some of these workers are earning. The general perception was that staff who worked for Aer Lingus, particularly the cabin crews, were working for one of the best companies in the country and would never strike. Many <Col N="848" /> people believed they were getting so much money they did not need increases. I have a lot of sympathy for these people, given the measly amount of money they earn. The company must negotiate with the staff and not take such a hard line approach. Ryanair would not allow its staff to have union representation. This is not good for the country or for workers.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Naughten on raising the issue of foreign workers coming to this country from outside Europe. These people are being brought here because of a shortage of workers. I hope these people will not be abused in the way the low paid were for 40 or 50 years when things were bad and 300,000 were unemployed. I hope foreign nationals will be protected in the same way as Irish nationals who are members of trades union. These people must not be treated like my father and others like him who had to emigrate to another country and work seven days a week. They had no union representation and if they did not arrive at their place of work in the morning or evening they would be told to go home. Now that there is near full employment in this country, Irish and foreign workers must be protected and not abused.</P>
    <P>People here are very good at telling others how to deal with their problems. I listen to Members on the Order of Business each morning voicing great concern at what is taking place outside the country. However, they do not seem to be as concerned about what is taking place within the country in relation to the rights of workers. As spokesman on health, I find it hypocritical that the State has appointed an inspectorate to oversee private nursing homes while there is no such inspectorate to oversee public nursing homes. I have been raising this issue for a long time. An inspectorate should be put in place to oversee both public and private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about employment in Mayo and in the west generally. There is a great imbalance between the amount of development taking place along the east coast, particularly in Dublin, and along the west coast. The Government does not seem to have the courage to relocate some of the development to the west. The IDA will say it is doing its job in bringing industrialists to the country and creating employment but that it is up to the Government to distribute the industry. The west did not do well in the recent IDA report. This region has again fallen behind. A company called Warners used to be located in north Mayo and this is why I wish to refer once again to unions and grant aid. Deputy Gilmore spoke about American companies and people in America making decisions which affect people here, be they workers, foremen or managers. Warners were in this country for many years and at one time employed approximately 300 people. Last August it decided to pull the rug from under the workers. I tabled a Dáil Question to find out if the funding had been returned to the Government or to Údaras, given that the company received a lot of State funding. However, the <Col N="849" /> company kept within the law, it remained in the country for ten years before pulling the plug. To be fair to the company, the workers received their redundancy payments and there was no dispute in that regard. This proves that many companies do not care about the country or the workers and they should not be allowed to create their own rules and regulations. If companies wish to set up in this country, they should be obliged to protect their workers. If they do not want workers to have union representation, they should not receive grant aid from the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a great responsibility in relation to the gas find in County Mayo. I hope the Government will do the correct thing in this regard. This is the first time a natural resource has been discovered in that area and I hope the Government will put the pipeline in place. I hope this will create the employment which has been so badly lacking in the past. I am aware Bord Gáis will say this is not feasible, but the Government has a moral obligation to look after the west, particularly north Mayo, which is the biggest unemployment black spot in the country. Last year, Údaras created approximately 170 jobs and lost approximately 270 in the area. This has happened consistently for the past three years. I hope the Government will take the correct decision in relation to the gas pipeline. The Taoiseach took part in a photocall recently with Bord Gáis. Some £100 million will be spent to bring the pipeline from north Mayo to Galway. As the Minister of State knows this pipeline will continue to Dublin and probably to Belfast. The people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and England will probably benefit more from this than the people of north Mayo. I hope the Government will not fail the people of north Mayo where this natural resource has been discovered. The roads infrastructure and gas pipeline must be put in place. The Government must give a commitment that the people of Belmullet, Crossmolina, Ballina, Castlebar and all the other towns in County Mayo, even if it is not viable, will be able to say to industrialists coming to the country that they have the gas, it is a cheap commodity and is something the company will be able to use. I hope the Government will do the right thing on this occasion for the people of the west.</P>
    <P>I hope the dispute which took place during the summer will not take place again. It should not have gone on for ten weeks without something being done to solve it. What happened should never happen again. The dispute was not settled but the workers went back to work after ten weeks. This should have happened after one week. People's livelihoods should not be put at risk in this way. Mechanisms should be put in place to deal with such disputes. I hope as a Member of this House that I will never see a Minister, a Taoiseach or a Government putting their hands up and saying they cannot do anything about such disputes. Politicians are elected to represent the people and to put in place legislation to deal with such problems. We as legislators must introduce <Col N="850" /> legislation to correct what happened during the summer. We must not allow a dispute to take place where a whole region is disadvantaged and because it is not a national problem it is not dealt with by the national Parliament. I have great sympathy for those who were out of work for ten weeks. Nevertheless, great inconvenience was caused to the general public. We are supposed to represent and legislate for those people. I hope this legislation will do what is necessary and that a Minister or Government will never put up their hands to say it has not worked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Ring's profound concerns about the hard pressed west, which he and Deputy Naughten represent. This Bill will do absolutely nothing, as the Minister of State well knows, to resolve a dispute such as that involving ILDA during the summer. There is nothing in this flimsy document which would in any way resolve a dispute where a relatively small group of workers seeks to engage in a major campaign for improved pay and conditions to which they are entitled. That recent industrial relations dispute affected many parts of Ireland but there have also been severe industrial relations problems on the DART system in Dublin. A significant number of trains are not running in my constituency because of an industrial relations problem and the Minister of State has taken no action.</P>
      <P>The sad reality is that after three and a half years of delay, obfuscation and reports of high level groups, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, maintains her profound, deep ideological abhorrence of the trade union movement and our colleagues in the Labour movement and is absolutely determined not to give recognition to that movement in the industrial relations sphere. Why is the legislation not entitled the trade union recognition Bill similar to the Labour Party Bill that was introduced a number of years ago? The Minister of State did not do so because the legislation is a flimsy and pallid copy of the Labour Party's Trade Union Recognition Bill, 1998, and it goes nowhere near resolving some of the fundamental issues attaching to trade union recognition. Aspects of the legislation will add to labour law but it will not take us far forward.</P>
      <P>Labour Party members from Dublin and surrounding counties stood on the picket line a few months ago on Parnell Street for many days with the ALDI workers. ALDI is a German company which set up in Dublin. Germany has trade union recognition and long, well established industrial relations procedures but the company chose not to recognise MANDATE or any other union to professionally represent the company's workers. This again illustrated in those painful days when we stood on the picket line at Parnell Street that the Tánaiste and Minister of State had not come to grips with one of the realities of modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers, including Deputy Gilmore, referred to the core of the Ryanair problem. We <Col N="851" /> marched in unison with our trade union colleagues two years ago when our Trade Union Recognition Bill was to come before the House. I am grateful that in the intervening period Ryanair's pilots have secured trade union recognition and are represented by IMPACT. The fundamental issue of the constitutional right of a citizen to be represented professionally by a trade union still has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for coming to the House to listen to my contribution. I referred earlier to the entrance of the German food companies into the Irish market. This is a growing trend and my constituency is awaiting the arrival of the second German retail distribution company. Local staff and workers are interested to know if a company which adheres to trade union recognition in its homeland will do so in Ireland. However, it has not been given much encouragement in that regard by the Government in the Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the features of the economy's performance over the past five or six years has been the massive expansion in the working population. There is an additional 500,000 workers, bringing the total workforce from 1.15 million to 1.7 million people. The vast majority of those workers are non-unionised and although many of them have trade associations and in-house representatives, they still have a profound interest in being allowed to be represented by a trade union.</P>
      <P>From my contacts with workers in companies such as Intel and other high tech digital companies around the northern fringe of County Kildare and Dublin, there is no recognition in those operations and workers find it difficult to have any type of professional representation in relation to their contracts when they are ill or when they return to work after illness. The hours are lengthy and workers are expected to have a Californian type of commitment without Californian wages. The wages in the company's homeland are still significantly higher than in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is deep concern in the trade union movement and among most citizens about the manner in which the economy has developed and the relative fall in unionisation, particularly in the private sector. Although many of the high tech companies have opted for a measure of trade union recognition, it is still the case that the vast bulk &ndash; over 70% &ndash; of private sector companies are not unionised and workers do not have the right to professional representation. Despite the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's efforts, the Labour Party still considers that this is a profound problem and a profound issue of fairness facing society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Ryanair dispute workers rightly asked if it was appropriate for Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, to have professional rep<Col N="852" /> resentation at the highest level to negotiate his £17 million per annum basic emolument &ndash; since then he has become super rich with hundreds of millions of pounds from his share options &ndash; why was it not right for cabin crew, baggage handlers and other workers that SIPTU and more latterly IMPACT have sought to represent? There is a fundamental issue of fairness and in the hope that the Labour Party will have a direct influence on Government policy in the future, this is an area to which we will return. We will profoundly consider developing this pallid Bill which contains many holes and does not solve many of the issues that have arisen with regard to ILDA, the ALDI dispute and, most importantly, the Ryanair dispute.</P>
    <P>The Bill has striking differences from the Bill I was proud to introduce on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues. One of the fundamental differences relates to the role of the LRC. It has not been codified in legislation although I am aware of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution through the LRC to which the Minister of State referred earlier. There are steps employers and workers must take before the Bill triggers the intervention of the Labour Court. However, in comparison to the Labour Party Bill, there are fundamental gaps.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that matters will go to the LRC which will appoint an officer from the advisory service. The LRC will work with the parties and an agreed cooling off period will be put in place. The LRC's advisory service will continue to work with the parties but the fundamental problem with that is the absence of a timeframe. There is no timeframe of any description in terms of how these steps will be taken. As an earlier speaker noted in relation to the rail dispute, the critical timeframe for consumers could be a matter of hours and certainly days.</P>
    <P>One might be supportive of the workers' just demands, but if one is depending on an essential bus or rail service in Mayo or west Cork, one would hope that the issue would be resolved in a specified timeframe. The Minister of State has failed dismally to incorporate this step in the legislation and to clearly spell out the timeframe to be operated to the satisfaction of the parties to a dispute. I draw the Minister of State's attention to this aspect.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill sought to consider the issue of representation. It is a difficult issue and, based on the ICTU document, the first report of the high level group came up with various levels of representation. However, it at least addressed the fundamental issue of the professional representation of workers by trade unions. There is nothing of that sort in this Bill. The Labour Party Bill included a provision where the Labour Court could order ballots and assess from various standpoints the ability of the trade union to represent different groups of workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte drew the House's attention to the situation where a few dozen workers from a total workforce of 600 might seek professional representation or where workers in a company, <Col N="853" /> who had been quiet members of a trade union for some time, might seek representation on the core issues of pay and conditions and ask the company to give their trade union some input into their future. Under this Bill, this would be dismissed out of hand because there is no provision to enable their level of support or the representations they could make to be measured. There is a huge lacuna in the Bill where the Minister of State has failed to address the status of the representation of employees and the people who seek to represent them.</P>
    <P>My fundamental criticism relates to the steps leading to the preliminary hearing through the Labour Court. Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) states: &ldquo;the trade union or the excepted body or the employees, as the case may be, have not acted in a manner which, in the opinion of the Court, has frustrated the employer in observing a provision of such code of practice&rdquo;. It glosses over the whole issue of the extent to which an industrial dispute was already under way.</P>

      <P>The mini-CTC contract relates to the installation of a new rail signalling system. The project, which was approved by the CIE board in March 1996, is considerably behind schedule and over budget. I have received a copy of a report which was prepared for CIE by independent consultants in relation to the execution of the mini-CTC contract. I have discussed the matter with the CIE chairman and there are ongoing discussions between my Department and CIE in relation to matters arising in the report.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is it true that a contract for £15.7 million will now cost between £25 million and £40 million, that there is an overrun of up to £25 million? Is it also true that the price was not locked into the contract? Furthermore, is it correct that the work has not been completed on any of the 28 stations designated for completion last December?

      <P>The way in which the contract was devised in 1996 was entirely unsatisfactory. I <Col N="854" /> was made aware of this matter by outside sources. That was how it came to my attention. Many of the points the Deputy made are correct. The nature of the contract as it was drawn up was very unsatisfactory. The contract documentation was not tight enough. Having read the report which was given to me by the chairman of CIE, I would have grave doubts about certain aspects of the whole operation concerning the public procurement of this signalling system. The Deputy is correct in what he has said. When the contract was drawn up in 1996 or early 1997 it was envisaged that it would cost £14 million, yet it has now risen from £25 million to £40 million. The work is not scheduled to be concluded until 2002, which is remarkable.</P>
      <P>Equally remarkable is that many of the people involved in initially drawing up the contract back in 1995 or 1996 have left to join one of the firms in question, MTL. Letters have been written to me concerning legal matters arising from this affair. While I know that matters raised here are not tenable in a legal situation, I am aware of the situation. The whole matter is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is it not the case that the taxpayer has again been taken for a ride? A contract that was supposed to cost £15 million has an overrun of up to £25 million which John citizen will have to pay. Is there not some bizarre stench off the entire contract, given, as the Minister has rightly acknowledged, that four of the people involved, the head of procurement, the signalling engineer, who was the manager in charge, the company solicitor and another engineer, have all effectively defected to the company with which they negotiated the contract?</P>

        <b>:</b> Four of the main people who were involved in the decision-making have gone to the company which will add £25 million more of taxpayers' money than was originally contracted for. What legal advice has the Minister received on this matter? This is a very serious situation. These people would not last ten minutes in the private sector. It is quite obvious that there was something extremely dubious and bizarre about the way in which the whole thing was negotiated. How can the matter be salvaged at this stage for the taxpayer? That is essentially what we are talking about, apart altogether from productivity and the need to bring the rail safety programme on schedule at the earliest possible stage.</P>

Following that the chairman gave me <Col N="855" /> a copy of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report between the middle and end of September. The CIE board will discuss the matter again at its next meeting. Following that, the action to be taken to move forward will have to be decided.</P>
      <P>Frankly, it is very difficult to see what can be done. The original price was £14 million and it is now estimated at between £25 million and £40 million &ndash; that is a wide disparity. I am distinctly unhappy that people have left and gone to one of the main companies which is part of this process. I await the next board meeting and my next meeting with the chairman to see what the board intends to do about it. I await their advice on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy for transport in the greater Dublin area for 2000 to 2016, entitled A Platform for Change, is estimated to cost a total of £14.15 billion. This figure includes £4.4 billion in respect of projects identified in the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006. The strategy identifies a substantial proportion of the proposed infrastructural investment as potentially suitable for delivery as public private partnership projects. These include the additional Luas lines, Metro, the suburban rail interconnector and the eastern bypass. I also expect that a substantial Exchequer contribution will be required over the implementation period to 2016. The financing arrangements will be addressed as the planning and implementation process proceeds, as part of the annual Estimates and budget cycle, in the <Col N="856" /> mid-term review of the national development plan and in the successors to the current national plan.</P>
      <P>The strategy provides an overall planning framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area. It is not a detailed blueprint for each of the individual projects and programmes. Each project will be taken through a detailed planning process. The DTO has recommended that project teams be established by the implementing agencies for each of the major projects. In the case of the Metro, I can confirm that the CIE light rail project team is already carrying out preliminary technical work related to the project.</P>
      <P>The phasing of the strategy is designed to address short-term transportation needs and to put in place an integrated transportation system which will meet the medium to longer-term requirements of the greater Dublin area. The strategy outlines four phases for implementation, from now to 2003, 2004 to 2006, the end of the national development plan, 2007 to 2010 and 2011 to 2016.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that since she came to office three and a half years ago, we have seen a succession of plans but very little action? Does she further agree that she spent the first two and a half years as Minister dealing with Luas? Does she agree that this plan, as presented, effectively abolishes Luas, except for one line from Tallaght to Connolly Street, and that the rest of the Luas project has been abandoned? Given that this is really a wish list for the future, will the Minister tell us what action she expects to be taken to implement any part of this plan in the next year? Will we see any action during the lifetime of the Government to implement any part of the plan so that it will be operative before the Minister's full five years as Minister with responsibility for transport is over? Will we see any of this in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who said five years. The first two years were tremendously occupied with safety and the Deputy knows that. Following the independent report, we secured £500 million from Cabinet for rail safety which comprises £350 million for the first three years and the remainder for the next phase. That has commenced and the funding for the third year is included in the Estimates for next year which will be published soon. That will mean £300 million will have been spent on rail safety and, if I did nothing else, that is a good thing to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided to concentrate in the immediate term last year on bus provision. Some 150 <Col N="857" /> additional new buses were provided and 223 this year, 100 of which are replacement buses and the other 123 of which are new additional ones. Two more bus lanes have been provided and two more will be provided by the end of the year. New DART carriages have arrived and extra rail carriages are on order.</P>

        <b>:</b> The poor taxpayer has been taken for another ride. It cost the Minister's Department and the taxpayer £77.5 million for bad advice on the sale of Eircom which resulted in a gravy train for consultants, advisers and executives and a disaster for small time investors. Is it not obvious that the shares were pushed and sold too hard and were overpriced and that was something that need never have happened?

The costs for the flotation were set in tandem with the advice given to us and were in line with the European norm for such shares.</P>
      <P>As a side issue and not commenting directly on the cost of the shares, it is interesting to note that many commentators in the week after the flotation said I had done the country wrong because the Cabinet committee had floated the company too cheaply.</P>

Was there any advance estimate or projection of the likely cost of this or was it a case for going forth and the taxpayer picking up the tab? Does the Minister not accept that, from <Col N="861" /> the point of view of the net result or so-called performance, to pay a performance bonus of £1.3 million to the chief executive and £700,000 to the second in command is absurd and obscene, especially given the disaster which subsequently occurred resulting from key decisions taken by the Government and implemented by the two people in question?</P>

      <P>The Director of Telecommunications Regulation is carrying out a public consultation at present on whether the delivery of television services is appropriate or even possible over telecommunications networks such as Eircom's copper network using certain new technologies, known as xDSL. Obviously, that is happening now, so I cannot comment on what Etain Doyle will produce.</P>
      <P>The increasing convergence between the broadcasting, information technology and telecommunications sectors will have a significant influence on the development of regulatory policy in this area. It is an objective of the European Community's policy relating to electronic communications that there should be fair competition between all available platforms and in the provision of services over those platforms. The European Commission has published a package of proposals setting out a new regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector. Discussions on these proposals have begun within the Council and the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the position developing would be unfair on Eircom in the context of convergence? Eircom will have to unbundle its local loop but there is no such obligation on cable television operators in terms of their fibreoptic cables. I am sure the Minister agrees that fibreoptic cables have much greater capacity. Cable television companies can cross-subsidise telephony, broadcasting and Internet services, a facility which is not possible with Eircom's fixed copper network. As a result, cable operators can offer a package which provides a telephony service at a low rate which destroys Eircom's market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Two issues arise from the Deputy's comments, both of which involve elements of the truth. The issue of unbundling the local loop has gone to the European Parliament <Col N="862" /> which will complete its consideration of the matter this week. The issue will then go back to the Council of Ministers on 22 December for ratification. Two matters arise from this. First, whether Eircom will get a proper return in modern terms for the infrastructural cost of installing the copper wiring and, second, the percentage rate of return over that cost. The regulator, Etain Doyle, is pursuing this matter with the intention of fixing a fair price.</P>
      <P>The second issue involves NTL's geographic spread. This is a real issue as NTL, and not Eircom, is the dominant entity in some urban areas. This is a matter for Etain Doyle but I will have an input into the policy issue of how that is devised.</P>
      <P>The other issue raised by the Deputy is very important. Eircom, like other operators, has a telecommunications licence which does not allow the company to provide television services over its network. However, the company has said it would like to provide such a service and has set this as an objective. Two difficulties arise from this. First, it is uncertain whether it is technically feasible to provide television services over a copper network using the DSL technologies. Second, the use of Eircom's copper network for the provision of this type of service may or may not be seen as infringing a cable operator's exclusive franchise. Etain Doyle has sought public consultation on these issues and received replies. She is examining the situation and will announce a judgment. This is a difficult situation but a solution will have to be found if it proves unfeasible to use the copper network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>From her response, I take it the Minister concedes that, in the context of telephony as part of a cable operator's package &ndash; one convergence package has already been announced &ndash; this puts Eircom at great risk. This is an urgent situation and the equity issue has to be addressed. The copper network's capacity for transmitting television signals would be restricted, at best, to one or two channels over a short distance. This is a real problem for Eircom and its fixed copper network. The issue of cross-subsidisation has to be addressed in the context of the cable television operators.</P>

      <P>The basic premise of the Deputy's comments is correct. There is a real issue if Eircom is disadvantaged by virtue of having the copper network, while another provider is advantaged, and if there is cross-subsidisation of <Col N="863" /> services by a second provider. Allied to the unbundling of the local loop this would place Eircom in a doubly disadvantaged position. The Deputy has done some work on this as his information is very up to date. The regulator will brief me on these issues and I will ask her to also update the Deputy on the technical details.</P>

      <P>My Department's review of the bus market in the greater Dublin area, which I submitted to the Cabinet committee in May, dealt in some detail with the question of ownership of the State bus companies in a franchised market.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the review was that both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann should be free to compete with each other in an effective way in a franchised market. In circumstances where both companies competed aggressively with each other for market share, it could be a zero sum game, or worse, for a single owner. Another concern was that a prudent common shareholder might discourage both companies from competing too aggressively with each other.</P>
      <P>The review concluded that at least one of the State companies should be examined for transference to private ownership. These and other regulatory proposals are currently the subject of public consultation and I welcome any comments which interested parties wish to make.</P>

      <P>I am still none the wiser as to why we have to wait at least ten years for competition. If we proceed along the lines suggested we will have to wait three years for legislation to break up CIE's subsidiary companies into independent companies. We will then proceed to privatisation with its attendant problems involving industrial relations, property, pensions and the promise to return workers in CIE's subsidiary companies to the CIE holding company if the companies were broken up. This will mean it will be ten years before we have competition. We will be lucky if we get ten months before there is total gridlock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise she is the only person who can prevent gridlock in Dublin in the very near future and that this can only be done by using buses? The Minister has spoken about the 273 extra buses but that is a drop in the ocean in terms of what is required. <Col N="864" /> Every day Dublin is getting closer to not being viable.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister also aware that Dublin Bus is not just taking buses off routes but is closing down routes to prop up the capacity on the quality bus corridors? Is she further aware that five QBCs are supposed to open by Christmas and that, if that happens, it will be at the expense of existing routes?</P>

      <P>New buses have not been purchased for ten or 12 years. I am aware and agree that, in addition to competition, the provision of buses is the immediate, but not the long-term, solution to tackling gridlock. We have already issued eleven licences and a range of new licences will be issued at the end of this month for orbital routes.</P>
      <P>We are confined by the 1932 Act under which services can only be provided on routes not serviced by public transport companies. I can only overturn that Act by new legislation. Plans for such legislation are being drawn up but it will not take ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">

      <P>One of the short-term measures recommended is that Dublin Bus be encouraged to sub-contract services. Is the Minister aware that this policy is doomed to failure? It has already been tried by Dublin Bus but it cannot get anyone to work for it. The idea is a non-runner.</P>
      <P>I welcome the issuing of licences. It is good for the consumer and Dublin Bus. I ask the Minister to take a more proactive approach. I accept, as she says, that she is constrained by the legislation, but surely the legislation only states that they must have regard for services given by CIE? Surely that, in itself, is a reason to provide additional licences? Would she not now look at providing licences for late-night and weekend services, particularly now that Dublin Corporation is introducing a new parking regime for the city centre? The bus service at the weekend is about 20% of the inadequate service during the week. She should look at the most congested areas.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has recently published proposals to amend the 1997 EU Postal Directive. These include proposals to reduce the maximum tariff and weight parameters of the reserved area within which the universal service provider in each member state, An Post in the case of Ireland, has exclusive rights. I should stress that these proposals relate solely to the letter post service. They do not have any implications for the services provided by the post office network.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the reserved area is to guarantee the provision of a universal service of a specified standard to all users, whether in rural or urban areas, throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The Government is in favour of the gradual but controlled liberalisation of the Irish postal market. In my examination of the Commission's most recent proposals in this regard, my primary concern will be to ensure a continuing commitment to a uniform service for all users. My understanding, from being at meetings in Brussels, is that there is no intention at EU level to depart from this principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is no proposal to remove the legal requirement that users enjoy the right to a universal service and An Post has been nominated as the universal provider. A possible reduction in the market share &ndash; it is reducing to 150 grammes, as the Deputy will be aware, with controlled liberalisation &ndash; will not remove the obligation on the company to provide a universal service. That remains the position.</P>
      <P>What there is great worry and concern about, which is a matter at which the EU must look, is the provision of the social security entitlements through the network. The Government, like previous Governments, took a decision that that should remain with An Post and that decision is being challenged at EU level by another service operator. I understand that the advice of the then Attorney General has been reinforced by the pending judgment in Europe on that matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> In addition to the universal service guarantee, will the Minister also take an interest in the type of service involved? Recently a properly addressed letter posted on 2 October was delivered to me on 7 October, five days later, and it did not come a thousand miles but less than 30 miles as it was sent in my constituency.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that many people had their doubts and anxieties about the Government's intentions regarding An Post confirmed by the infamous An Post viability plan, which was subsequently withdrawn, and by, for example, the attempt without consultation to impose by stealth post boxes at the head of rural lanes, where people living on their own had to travel a quarter mile or in some cases a half-mile just to collect their mail, and also through the most recent blueprint, Transformation through Partnership in An Post, which is shedding jobs in many smaller offices and centralising them in larger provincial locations?

      <P>In the context of the importance of a postal service to rural areas, can the Minister assure the House that the Commission's May 2000 proposals will not result in either an increase in service cost in isolated areas or a reduction in the frequency of the service? I understand, for instance, that in Sweden they reduced the service to once a week. Can the Minister assure us that that is not what will emerge if this proposal is enacted here?</P>

      <P>We await, as I said, the European view on the social security issues and until we get the final view, we cannot be truly sure what they will say about the way one will receive entitlements at each post office, which is a huge part of the post offices' business.

      <P>The proposed EU Regulation on unbundled access to the local loop will not affect the obligation on all EU member states to ensure that all users in their territory have access to a basic set of telecommunications services at an affordable price irrespective of geographic location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universal service obligation is clearly set out in Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 February 1998 on the application of the open network provision to <Col N="868" /> voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment. The proposed EU regulation on unbundled access to the local loop does not seek to amend this provision. Local loop unbundling will complement the existing provisions in Community law guaranteeing universal service and affordable access for all citizens in the European Union by enhancing competition, economic efficiency and bringing maximum benefit to users.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, responsibility for providing the universal service lies with Eircom which was designated for this task in 1999 by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. In the case where there is a proven financial burden on the relevant operator for providing the universal service, there is provision whereby the director can set up a funding mechanism to meet the cost involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply.

Will this fund also provide for repairs to the copper network, obviously in the context of the unbundling of the local loop?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the universal service lies with Eircom and where there is an undue financial burden to provide that, the fund will be there to meet the full cost involved. I do not know whether that involves strengthening the copper wire which makes the local loop, but I will find out for the Deputy. Whether it is just for the cost of provision or whether it combines with the need to strengthen the copper wire to enable the service to be strengthened or added to is a separate matter, but I will inquire about that.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not giving us an assurance in terms of future connections and what she is giving us is unclear. I became aware of a case recently where I understand the installation cost was about £11,000 for Eircom. As the Minister will know, there is a system at the moment known as carrier pre-select, and the carrier pre-select card came through for a different company. A sum of £11,000 odd was spent and the only amount that would go to Eircom out of that, as things stood, is 0.6p per call. I understand there is a two monthly rental charge. We need to move away from that inequity where a totally unjustifiable burden could be carried by Eircom in terms of keeping in place&mdash;</P>

As it was nominated by the director to be the provider of universal service and where there is a proven financial burden on the relevant operator for providing the universal service, it can be recouped by Eircom. The point Deputy O'Shea made was that Eircom could have done the work, then the carrier pre-select comes in and another provider reaps the benefit of the work already done. That is clearly something the director will have to take into account. I, too, know of the case about which the Deputy spoke and it is something we will be bringing to the attention of the director.</P>

Does the Minister accept that Eircom, in many instances, has the worst of both worlds? It has an obligation under the universal service operation to roll out the infrastructure, so to speak, in many areas &ndash; in the case instanced by Deputy O'Shea, at a cost of £10,000 or £12,000. However, the customer then switches over to another telecom service provider such as Esat. The company cannot sustain that kind of obligation without it&mdash;</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister acknowledge that Eircom and the Communications Workers Union possibly have a case when they make the point that they have been asked to <Col N="870" /> unbundle completely, to throw open their entire facility, whereas the other service providers, irrespective of how big they grow, will not be asked to unbundle? Is there merit in considering the possibility that when some of the other competitors have come in for a specific period of time, three or four years, and have established a major penetration in the market, that they likewise might be asked to unbundle their services with a view to liberalising the entire scheme and system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Creed, the regulator has said that she will provide the funding to enable Eircom to provide the network to those who want it and if that causes an undue burden on the relevant operator, there is a fund to pay back or to transmit money to Eircom to enable it to cover that cost. After that, the carrier pre-select comes into play and that is at the behest of the consumer and whatever firm he or she wishes to call upon. The payment will already have been made if the provision of the infrastructure caused an undue burden. The profit which would accrue on the calls goes to that carrier and not to the carrier who puts in the infrastructure. If providing the infrastructure is a burdensome task, it will be covered by this fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen asked me what I considered &ldquo;affordable&rdquo;. I expect affordable to be somewhere in the middle. There is a constant push now to bring prices down. Eircom has announced a 50% reduction on costings and prices of all calls. When you compare the price of calls now with five years ago, it is amazing what the competitive arena has brought about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked about unbundling. We touched on that in an earlier reply. It is clear that in many areas ntl will be the major incumbent. I live in a flat and ntl drops in leaflets every day telling me what it can provide. I said in response to Deputy Ring recently that it is clear that in time it will be an incumbent as well and its services will need to be looked at in an unbundling way.</P>

      <P>I met representatives from the Retired Aviation Staff Association on 10 October 2000 to hear details of its submission for enhanced pension benefits presented to the task force. At the meeting I undertook to raise the concerns of the association with the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. I hope to have meetings on that matter next week. I also undertook on behalf of the association to clarify some issues with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on receipt of additional information from the association, which is awaited. It said it would send it to me.</P>
      <P>The task force on pensions established by the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta at my request to examine concerns about the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme submitted a report to the chairmen of the companies concerned at the end of May 2000.</P>
      <P>The task force report summarised the main concerns and views about the pension scheme made by various representative associations in submissions and presentations and an independent actuary costed the various proposals received.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the task force report, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta commissioned separate reviews of the report. As far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company proposes to establish a new pension scheme in due course in accordance with section 32 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1988, and the company is giving consideration to this matter.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus, as a result of its review and having regard to the structure and terms of the existing scheme, decided that the most appropriate course of action was to set about establishing a separate pension scheme for relevant Aer Lingus staff. In light of these circumstances, the airline has been discussing the terms of a proposed new pension scheme with employee representatives. The company has also recently outlined its proposals to the Retired Aviation Staff Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appropriate enabling provisions to allow Aer Lingus to establish the new pension scheme are contained in the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000. Under those provisions, it is proposed that existing Aer Lingus employees will transfer to the proposed new pension scheme while Aer Lingus pensioners will have the option of either remaining in the <Col N="872" /> existing scheme or alternatively joining the proposed new scheme.</P>

      <P>First, does the Minister accept that resolving the issues posed for retired aviation staff is not solely a matter for the chairmen of the companies involved? She seems to suggest in her reply that this was a matter she passed on to them. Does she accept a Government role in this? Is she aware that the retired aviation staff indicated, and I cite their resolution, that both companies totally refused all aspects of their claim? Will she comment on that statement by them which is based on actual discussions relating to the shortfall in their pensions? On the actuarial costs, can she confirm that the shortfall in the pension would require an investment in the order of £50 million to make good the shortfalls to existing pensioners? How does she see that shortfall being made good because she indicated that those who built the company would not suffer in her watch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met the members of the Retired Aviation Staff Association last week I accepted very clearly that they had many points which must be addressed. There is no particular objective in their telling me what we would all know, that people at that time worked far more difficult hours, under far more difficult circumstances, than people have to work now. Clearly, they have a case. They asked me if I would pass on their concerns and I undertook to do so. I will do so next week at two separate meetings. I also have already conveyed to the Taoiseach, privately and personally, my belief that this matter must be addressed adequately and I hope that with commitment I will be able to do so. The first step I was asked to take was to convey their concerns and their dissatisfaction to the two chairmen, which I will do. As Members will realise, this matter did not arise during the past week or number of years; it is an ongoing matter. It is sad to meet people of that age, see their payslips and know how little they are receiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and also for her positive attitude towards the case made to her by the pensioners. Does she agree that the task force in reporting, ignored the case <Col N="873" /> made by the pensioners? Not alone did the companies ignore it, but the task force totally ignored it and made no reference to their case in reporting. That left the companies free to take the decision they did. Does she agree that the historical aspect of this matter goes back some 30 years and that the company does not pay enough contributions and therefore, there is not enough funds in the kitty to have a proper pension scheme? For example, is the Minister aware that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pay 6% as an employer, the ESB pays 11.9%, Irish Cement pay 13%, Irish Life pays 19%, P.J. Carroll paid 21% and Aer Lingus pays 6%? The Minister agreed that the insufficiency of employer contributions into the pension funds is the basis of the problem. Does she agree and is she aware that, arising from the historical shortfall and the consequent slippage, Aer Lingus pensioners of about 20 years are now on about half the pension they would otherwise have expected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his concern. He and two Deputies of my party asked me to meet the people concerned and I was glad to do so. This goes back many years and I hope to receive a table illustrating this matter today or tomorrow. Alone among the semi-States, the contributions have not matched the contributions made by other semi-State employers over many years. This matter was raised on various occasions by Ministers to whom people had come with their stories, but it never developed into an effort to match up the pensions or make them commensurate with those in other semi-State bodies. It is a task for which there must be a fair amount of goodwill and a great deal of work must be put into it. However, I hope and am sure that we can manage it. I intend to stick with it. I do not know if we will be able to meet all the concerns but I intend to stick with the matter until we hopefully can resolve it. It would not be correct to progress on any matter in Aer Lingus if we did not try to rectify that particular matter over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Minister clarify what she said in her reply that both Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus were examining the possibility of establishing new separate pension schemes? Would such new schemes only affect those people who will be entering them &ndash; in other words, people currently still at work &ndash; and would not take into account the shortfall for the existing pensioners? Second, the Minister said there is an appropriate clause in the Aer Lingus Bill but in view of her answer the other day, that she would not be proceeding with the Aer Lingus privatisation for some time yet, could she give a commitment that any legislation required would be introduced separately from the Aer Lingus Bill so that we would not have to wait for the major legislation? Finally, will she examine the precedent created by the Hospital Sweepstakes legislation brought in by her colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, whereby pensions were paid to a group <Col N="874" /> of pensioners where there was a huge shortfall in the pension fund or no pension fund at all? Perhaps the same precedent could be used here to put in this extra £50 million needed to upgrade the pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the exact amount &ndash; the figure of £50 million was put forward by Deputy Bruton. That provision which was made for the employees of the Hospital Sweepstakes has been drawn to my attention. I am proceeding with the Bill. I told the Deputy in reply to her very good question, which I was glad to hear, that while the present industrial relations unrest continues at Aer Lingus, it would be a folly for me to proceed with looking for a flotation in those circumstances. However, that does not mean, as I said yesterday &ndash; I see what the Deputy said in <i>The Irish Times&mdash;</i></P>

There is a list of items that are unusual in the scheme. Does the Minister agree that the new proposals do not address these issues and alternative ones are required to address the specific problems of existing pensioners? Is the Minister saying, and I would welcome this, that Aer Lingus will not be privatised before this issue is resolved?</P>

Does she agree that the pensioners are looking to her to deliver on that shortfall? What will she say to the chairman and the board about their responsibilities?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 32 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I recently met a delegation from the Baldonnel area which is concerned that the development of commercial civil aviation operations at Baldonnel aerodrome could create environmental and safety concerns. I am also aware that other people in the Baldonnel area would favour increased civil aviation activity to promote development and job creation.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of civil aviation policy generally, substantial capital investments currently nearing completion at Dublin Airport will provide adequate capacity for the next five years. There is sufficient scope for further expansion at that site which, depending on the rate of future traffic growth, will meet projected requirements. I do not consider, therefore, that there is any requirement for the State to promote or develop a second civil airport for the Dublin region at this time. I do not consider either, however, that the State should stop any private concern from pursuing such a course.</P>
      <P>A private investor may develop a facility for civil aviation at any location subject, of course, to planning permission and aviation safety requirements. Ownership of Baldonnel resides with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, and the scope and scale of operations at that aerodrome are matters for him and his Department. In the case of Baldonnel, therefore, if there were a private investor he or she would need to reach agreement with the Minister for Defence regarding terms and conditions for using that military installation for commercial civil aviation purposes.</P>
      <P>There would also be a requirement for an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. An appropriate amendment of section 3 of the IAA Act is included in the Aviation Regulation Bill currently before this House, not for the purpose of facilitating any commercial aviation at Baldonnel but to permit the Irish Aviation Authority to regulate a proposed pilot training school at the Gormanston military aerodrome.</P>

      <P>Private development may take place and it may be facilitated. At the meeting with Baldonnel liaison group did the Minister take on board the fears expressed about an increase in private flying and the dangers posed in a heavily built up area, which will be even more so with the proposed construction of thousands of houses? Did she take into account the fears expressed about aircraft flying over Tallaght hospital at as low an altitude as 500 feet and noise along the flight path particularly in relation to schools? Fears were expressed that while safety in the air was well catered for safety on the ground was secondary.</P>

      <P>The meeting was very helpful and I took on board the legitimate fears expressed. Neither the Government nor I have any plans to open a State airport at Baldonnel. If a private investor wishes to do so, that is a matter for him or her. Such a person would have to get planning permission and so on but that would not have anything to do with me or my Department.</P>

      <P>&mdash;as far as the privatisation of Baldonnel airport is concerned. Does the Minister agree that it was extraordinary that she gave time in her ministerial speaking slot to her nephew, Deputy Conor Lenihan, a local Deputy, to boast to this House about the development of a private airport at Baldonnel, not at Gormanston? Does she agree that this is the thin end of the wedge, that without section 46 it is not possible to proceed with that and the likelihood is there will be a freight airport at Baldonnel causing real difficulties between Killiney and Straffan, in a three mile wide belt with 400 night flights by dirty, large, noisy airplanes? That is the likely scenario. What is Government policy on the provision of such airports? The planning authorities must have regard to Government policy when making decisions on private development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said about there not being a need for a second airport in this location for the time being. However, the problem is we are putting through legislation which will facilitate the future use of Baldonnel for civil aviation. Does the Minister agree that if Baldonnel were a greenfield site being considered for an airport, whether private or public, it would be subject to the most rigorous analysis, with environmental impact assessments, sworn inquiries and expert evidence. It would be folly to introduce legislation which would facilitate its use for additional aircraft take-offs and landings, whether public or private, prior to the necessary investigation and rigorous analysis taking place. This is a very densely populated area and I am very reluctant to vote away control. I ask the Minister to really consider this in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I reflected that view to the association which contacted me. I told it that prior to Committee Stage, which I hope will be next week, I would reflect on section 46 in case there was an implicit, rather than stated, ease<Col N="879" /> ment in it, whereby, while there would always be a need for planning permission, larger scale aviation could be developed without many of the rigorous matters to which Deputy Mitchell referred, such as environmental impact studies. I am reflecting on that, so that and any applicant will have to undergo the full rigours, as is proper, in terms of planning permission and the other attendant matters now required for any application. I am certainly reflecting on section 46 to see whether an amendment tabled by me or another Member or a deletion would be the appropriate way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister reflects on the matters in section 46 raised by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, will she also reflect on the fact she told us a few moments ago that section 46 was designed to cover Gormanston? Will she bear in mind what her colleague, the Minister for Defence, told the Dáil on 15 May, when he said that before a final decision could be taken on the potential for joint military and civilian use of Baldonnel, the Irish Aviation Act, 1993, would have to be amended? That appears to be in conflict with what the Minister said today. When the Minister is further reflecting on section 46, perhaps she would reflect on the possibility of making it clear in the legislation that it does not refer to Baldonnel but merely to Gormanston. This would considerably ease the fears of the people in the area concerned and would give some credibility to the statement the Minister has made.</P>

      <P>I told the deputation something which I am glad to repeat here, that I would reflect on section 46 and take soundings on it. I am going to look at it very seriously. I have just given the same answer that the Deputy received in May. I said &ldquo;There would also be a requirement for an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993&rdquo;, which is what I think the Minister, Deputy Smith, told the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence said in the House that before the final decision could be taken on the potential for joint military and civilian use of Baldonnel, the Irish Aviation Act, 1993, would have to be amended. I assume section 46 represents that amendment. If that is the case, will the Minister clear up this apparent contradiction between what she and the Minister for Defence have said?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An appropriate amendment of Section 3 of the IAA Act is included in the Aviation Regulation Bill . . . not specifically for the purpose <Col N="880" /> of facilitating any commercial aviation at Baldonnel but rather to permit the Irish Aviation Authority to regulate a proposed pilot training school at the Gormanston military aerodrome.</P>

Is it her intention to amend the aviation Act, by section 46 of the proposed Act, to allow the use of military airports by civilian authorities? She has now introduced the red herring of Gormanston. Will she agree to ring fence this amendment so that it applies only to Gormanston? My colleagues have been trying to drag that decision out of her. Could she now make that clear?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister also agree that the Minister for Defence is on record, and has had a practice, of selling everything he gets his hands on, including the barracks in Naas? When he could not sell it to anybody else, he sold it to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. He will sell Baldonnel if the Minister gives him this licence to have a freight airport there and she knows that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Statistics Office approximately 9.35 mtoe &ndash; millions of tonnes of oil equivalent &ndash; were imported into Ireland in 1999. The value of these imports amounted to £893 million.</P>
      <P>In regard to renewable sources of energy, Ireland is endowed with a considerable resource and my aim is to create the circumstances that will facilitate the commercial exploitation of these resources so that they make a valuable contribution to meeting Ireland's electricity needs.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, I set an increased target of 500 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating plant to be delivered by 2005. The target will double the contribution of renewable energy to electricity generated from 6% to 12% and the total avoided CO2 emissions will be in the order of 2.4 million tonnes, making a significant contribution towards meeting our greenhouse gas emissions limit.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has overall responsibility for the implementation of policies to limit our greenhouse gas emissions. I understand the Minister will publish his strategy shortly.</P>

Will the Minister encourage his Cabinet colleagues to support him in making a major effort in the development of renewable energy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we have a huge renewable energy resource. That has been proven and is the result of a number of stud<Col N="882" /> ies already conducted. I do not agree with the Deputy on the other matter. I emphasise that the Government has a fully-funded policy on energy efficiency and renewables. I look forward to driving forward that policy which is laid out in the Green Paper published in September 1999. That Green Paper was well received in all sectors of the energy area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Middle East. It has already taken an appalling toll of life and put in jeopardy the Middle East peace process in which so many hopes have been placed. It poses a threat to the stability of the whole region. I have extended my deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have been killed and to those were injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in the Palestinian Territories and Israel is truly tragic. Just when the parties <Col N="883" /> were closer to an agreement than they have ever been, the essential basis for peace &ndash; trust and confidence &ndash; has been seriously undermined. Instead, anger and frustration, stemming from the failure of each side to understand the problems of the other, has boiled over, resulting in the horrors we have witnessed.</P>
    <P>Intensive diplomatic efforts have been made to bring the crisis to an end. I pay tribute, in particular, to the efforts which President Clinton and President Mubarak, together with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and other leaders, have made in recent days to save the peace process. We know from our own experience of building peace in Northern Ireland that there is no other way forward.</P>
    <P>The immediate cause of the crisis was the ill-advised and provocative visit by Mr. Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount, or Haram-al-Sharif, in the old city of Jerusalem. This site, holy to both Moslems and Jews, is at the heart of the dispute of the future status of Jerusalem, which is one of the most difficult and sensitive issues remaining to be resolved in the peace process. Mr. Sharon's visit gave rise to an outraged reaction by Palestinian demonstrators, which in turn led to an excessive reaction by the Israeli military. Further widespread protests and incidents followed, resulting in countless injuries and over 100 deaths, including many children and the brutal murder of two Israeli soldiers in a police station in Ramallah.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear its position. We deplore all acts of violence. We have called on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to avoid further escalation. We have underlined the need for both sides to act quickly to reach agreement in the Middle East peace process and to avert the danger that this conflict might extend further. The objective must remain the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, which must necessarily recognise both Israel's right to live in peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>In our own bilateral contacts, within the past two weeks, we have strongly put forward our views. I met recently with the Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Nabil Shaath, here in Dublin, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met with the Israeli Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nawaf Massalha, also in Dublin. Yesterday, I met here in Leinster House with Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior, a special emissary of Prime Minister Barak, and encouraged him to join with the Palestinians in rebuilding trust and confidence, mutual respect, parity of esteem and a spirit of partnership. I described our own experience in these islands in developing a win-win approach. Stressing the need for maximum restraint, I assured him of our support for all efforts to restore calm and to find a peaceful solution. I also reminded him of the very concrete contribution we have made to peace in the region through our partici<Col N="884" /> pation in UN peace-keeping in Lebanon, where the safety of our troops is of paramount concern.</P>
    <P>We have also fully supported the European Union in its on-going efforts to defuse the crisis. The informal European Council meeting in Biarritz last weekend called for an immediate end to all violence and urged all parties to demonstrate political courage and responsibility so that reason and tolerance might prevail over fear, hatred and extremism before the point of no return was reached. The European Union has been active in encouraging the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to come together and work for a ceasefire. President Arafat, President Chirac, Prime Minister Barak and US Secretary of State Albright met in Paris in an effort to find a solution. The EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, participated in the summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt earlier this week.</P>
    <P>The meeting at Sharm-el-Sheikh produced a number of agreements on measures to halt the violence. The following major points were agreed. First, both sides are to issue statements unequivocally calling for an end to violence and to take immediate concrete measures to eliminate points of friction. These include withdrawal of Israeli forces to positions they had occupied before the outbreak of disturbances and an end to the closure of Palestinian territories and the reopening of Gaza airport, as well as renewal of security co-operation between the two sides. Second, the United States together with the Israelis and the Palestinians and the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will establish a fact-finding committee to look into the events of the past weeks. Third, the United States will consult with the parties in the next two weeks on how to resume the peace negotiations leading to a permanent settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
    <P>We appeal to the parties, who have demonstrated their sense of responsibility at this critical moment, to implement these decisions without delay. The two essential aims will be to end the violence and to restore at least a working measure of confidence. This will require openness and transparency on all sides in implementing the measures. Some of these measures are already being put in place. Reports overnight suggest that the first signs of the easing of tension are appearing but fears of renewed violence persist and developments over the next few days will be of crucial importance. The General Assembly of the United Nations has begun debating the crisis. On Saturday, Arab leaders will be meeting in Cairo for their first summit in four years. Their discussions will focus on the crisis and the ways in which a consensus approach can be developed. Later this month, the Israeli Parliament will resume and it too will be focusing its attention on the grave situation now facing the Israeli Government and people.</P>
    <P>The first priority, as agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, must be to end the violence. This, <Col N="885" /> however, will not be enough; the immediate causes and effects must be addressed. The underlying frustrations and anger have to be removed. If a cessation of violence is to take hold and remain in place, it will be essential to move quickly to rebuild trust and confidence. This will not be an easy task but it is a vital one. In this context, it is important that the investigation of what has happened will be as open, thorough and transparent as possible. We, with our EU partners, have supported a full international investigation. If this investigation is to help restore trust and confidence, it can only do so if it itself enjoys the trust and confidence of all concerned. I see a resumption of the peace negotiations as offering the only path out of the recurring cycle of bloodshed and suffering.</P>
    <P>Although the Camp David talks in July made considerable progress, it did not prove possible to overcome some major difficulties. Chief among these were the question of Palestinian refugees and, most intractable of all, the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem. This is the central issue. If it can be solved, everything else is likely to fall into place. At the core of this issue is sovereignty over the Jewish and Moslem holy places. Most difficult of all is the problem of the Islamic Haram-al-Sharif and the Jewish Temple Mount, which share the same site. For both sides, this is more a religious and symbolic matter than a territorial one and both are said to have adopted mutually exclusive positions. What seems clear is that no comprehensive solution is possible unless each side accords the other sovereignty over its own holy places or accepts a form of international sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long been sympathetic to the unqualified right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which includes the option of a state and is not subject to any veto. We would prefer to see this achieved through a negotiated solution. We believe, together with our partners in the European Union, that the establishment of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and acceptance as an equal partner in the region, an objective we equally support.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to this process was reflected earlier this year in the decision of the Government to establish a representative office in Ramallah and to increase our development co-operation activities in the Palestinian territories. Last week the Government allocated $100,000 to the Palestinians as a humanitarian response to the shortage of medical supplies in the West Bank. In parallel, we have sought to encourage the development of relations with Israel, both bilateral and in the framework of the EU, in a way that will also strengthen the basis for lasting peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>In ten weeks Ireland will take on the responsibilities of membership of the Security Council and we are preparing ourselves for this task. <Col N="886" /> Developments in the Middle East will continue to be one of the issues of major concern and I will be anxious to ensure that, through our diplomatic network and through my contacts, we are in a position to make a constructive and effective contribution. I am currently looking at the possibilities for making an early visit to the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the tragic nature of the crisis. It is particularly poignant that, in this millennial year which should be a time of celebration and bringing people together, the holy places should have been the scenes of violence and death. Thousands of pilgrims from this country, as well as from many others, have been visiting these holy places. Many of them have been affected by the disturbances, but I am glad to report that all Irish citizens in the region are safe. We have provided information and guidance to those planning to travel as well as providing consular assistance, where necessary, to those already there.</P>
    <P>It is a source of particular sadness to me, which I am sure will be shared by all Members of the House, that the land and places which are sacred for the many millions who adhere to three of the world's major religions &ndash; Christianity, Islam and Judaism &ndash; should have witnessed such hatred and violence. I assure the House that we will continue to work together with our partners and friends in Europe, Israel and the Arab world to encourage a return to the only path which leads away from conflict and towards genuine peace, security and justice for all peoples and countries of the Middle East. I will also make every effort to ensure that this House and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are kept fully informed and notified of the Government's activities to this end.</P>

      <P>I am glad we are having this debate on a crisis which has huge implications for the Middle East. It also has global implications. I do not take issue with the positions adopted by the Minister and I assure him of our continuing support for his efforts in this area.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to the search for a resolution to this problem. The European Union must take a stronger role in the Middle East peace process. The geographic proximity of the area will be brought into sharper focus with the enlargement of the Union into central and eastern Europe and even more so when it extends to the eastern Mediterranean with the accession of Cyprus and, eventually, Turkey. At that stage, Israel and Palestine will be our next door neighbours.</P>
      <P>The United States, which has been the power broker in the region, is not accepted by the Arabs as an independent honest broker. The Americans are even more constrained in playing an independent role by domestic political considerations and, at this time, upcoming elections. That point was brought home to me by an e-mail from a west Cork constituent of my colleague, Deputy Creed, which arrived yesterday from Oman. She writes as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> As I have previously said, my physical safety is not an issue here although, to be frank, it was an issue a few days ago. The situation in Israel looks as if it is backing away from a full scale war but that means nothing as things will not be resolved. Clinton is leaving the White House. He may be reviled here but the fact remains that he is the President who has done more than any other to broker peace. Gore and Bush have never shown that international diplomacy is their forte or area of interest. Who does that leave as an international mediator? Kofi Annan does not command the same authority.</P>
    <P>In that context, I strongly suggest that the European Union takes a larger role in the attempts to broker a settlement of the Middle East crisis.</P>
    <P>While the US has been the major financial and political supporter of Israel, the European Union has played its role for both. It has opened its markets to Israeli products, such as fruit, vegetables and flowers, and has made a major contribution to the Israeli economy. At the same time, the EU is the main financial supporter of the Palestinians. In that situation the EU can and should have a major role as an honest broker in the search for a peaceful solution.</P>
    <P>The EU peace envoy, Mr. Moratinos, plays a discreet &ndash; some would say invisible &ndash; role. France and the UK act unilaterally and the result is too many conflicting voices from Europe. I wish to see a higher profile political appointee with the full backing of the European Union taking an active diplomatic role in the search for a Middle East solution. Ireland should take a leading role in pushing that point of view. As a small member state and given our forthcoming role on the UN Security Council, Ireland should continue, bilaterally, to extend the hand of friendship and understanding to both sides.</P>
    <P>The spirit of friendship, however, does not and should not restrict us from commenting and criticising where appropriate in a fair and balanced way. In that context, I have no hesitation in condemning the actions of the Israeli opposition leader, Sharon, whose provocative actions on the Temple Mount, for domestic political purposes, were principally responsible for unleashing the violence over the past month. It was a direct affront to the Palestinians, not least because in the ascent to the Temple Mount, Sharon was accompanied by a battalion of soldiers and armed policemen, variously estimated to number between 750 and 2,000. In the interests of balance, it is fair to point out that his action was also a considered affront to the Israeli Prime Minister, Barak, who had previously expended great efforts in furthering the peace process.</P>
    <P>The general Israeli reaction to the violence was over the top and, not surprisingly, resulted in more than 100 dead and at least 2,500 wounded Palestinians. Nobody will forget the picture of the 12 year old child cowering for protection from Israeli snipers behind his father before he was <Col N="888" /> killed. The disproportionate reaction by the Israelis was obvious.</P>
    <P>The Palestinians are not angels and in some instances the immediate cause of the confrontations was the stone throwing actions of Palestinian youths. On this issue, however, two points should be made. The frustrations of the Palestinians were aggravated by the placing of Israeli tanks and army units in the main Arab towns, blocking movement between towns and cities and resulting in an economic blockade. The Israelis also suffered some casualties, including the horrific murder of the two army reservists in Ramallah so reminiscent of the equally horrific murder of the British soldiers in Milltown cemetery in Belfast some years ago. Again, the disproportionate bombing reaction to the actions of a mob caused Israel in that instance to descend to the level of the mob.</P>
    <P>I hope the recent summit will lead to a de-escalation of violence and an atmosphere in which discussions on the peace process can resume. I am convinced that what is necessary is the swift conclusion of a deal that is fair and just to both sides. Clearly, neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians will go away. What is necessary is a fair compromise to allow them to live peacefully together in the area.</P>
    <P>The Palestinians must accept that Prime Minister Barak, genuinely and from a difficult political base, wants a settlement. The Israelis must accept that Chairman Arafat has his own difficulties in the negotiations and that there are behind him people who are waiting hopefully for his demise. Hamas and other extreme fundamentalists understand violence and blood only as the way forward. The Israelis must understand the position of Chairman Arafat. The fundamentalists are actively hostile to the peace process and Ireland knows what is involved in trying to deal with murderous extremists.</P>
    <P>The Israelis must get their army out of the Palestinians' faces and away from the flashpoints. They should remove the economic stranglehold on Arab territories. The Palestinians must make every effort to reduce violent confrontation and, in so far as it is physically and politically possible, should re-arrest known terrorists.</P>
    <P>An honest analysis and evaluation of the recent violence and deaths would help to lay the groundwork for further negotiations. Whether the present Clinton proposals will provide the answers remains doubtful as the format proposed points to its inherent lack of honest independence and the current American electoral situation hardly provides the best backdrop for an independent approval on their part.</P>
    <P>In that situation, I propose the EU should play a much more positive role. Statements of concern and support for the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East are modestly useful. A positive role trying to broker a settlement is the role which I now urge the European Union to undertake. The time is right for such an approach but that time is running out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful Members have been given an opportunity to make brief statements on this conflict. I referred to this last week, given the events that were taking place. I believe Members on all sides of the House, including the Minister, are impelled by an anxiety that everything they do and say would contribute to bring forward such momentum as might have been established in those talks which might, I hope, lead to a cease-fire. We must bear in mind that it is appropriate for us to discuss this issue. Our experience of conflict, and any fragility that might exist in our advances towards creating a permanent resolution in Northern Ireland, qualifies rather than disqualifies us to have an opinion on this matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that the European Union should play a more active role on this issue. European Union statements of 29 September and 1 and 2 October were unsatisfactory. The EU's first statements were weak in that they failed to come to terms with what the whole world agreed was the use of unacceptable force. We all watched the shooting of a 12 year old boy. I do not have the time in the ten minutes allotted to me to discuss the issuing of three different statements within 24 hours. If this was because insufficient information was available, that is fair enough, but it is also possible to put another construction on it, that is, that another version was being drawn up. This was morally indefensible.</P>
      <P>Later, on the same side of the conflict, there was the shooting of an olive gatherer on land of his which was being dispossessed. On the opposite side, the whole world and I were appalled at the near ritualistic killing of two Israeli soldiers by a mob and the disrespect shown not just to life but to the bodies of the victims. I condemn unequivocally and unreservedly this action.</P>
      <P>Reflecting on what the Minister and the previous speaker said, it would be a victory for Ariel Sharon if the present conflict continued and people retreated into obdurate positions. It is difficult to believe that the situation would be otherwise. I agree with those who said it is difficult to see how this visit can be justified, how the support and shelter of it can be justified or how it can be construed as anything other than the greatest provocation.</P>
      <P>The succeeding interviews by Mr. Sharon after the conflict had reached its most severe point are interesting. He is anxious to press on, temporarily unrewarded by a seat in Government. Given his views on Jerusalem, it is clear that he is unwilling to countenance the slightest compromise. His views are similar on the issue of refugees. On shared sovereignty, his views give no scope for any Palestinian comfort. He is silent on the issues of the occupied territories and conditions of war, to which the United Nations resolutions refer. It seems to me, therefore, that there is very little hope if he prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side, there is a lot of criticism. I am not foolish enough to think there is a single <Col N="890" /> Palestinian opinion. I believe it is dangerous for those who are critical to ask is Chairman Arafat in control, can he deliver and, if he does not deliver immediate peace, he has disqualified himself from negotiations and from the implementation of a future where both peoples might be able to live together. To be fair, great risks have been taken by and within the Israeli Cabinet to bring the peace process to the point where it was before the present tragic breakdown. Great risks have been taken also on the Palestinian side. If there is to be a step forward, it must go beyond the present step of arranging a cease-fire, when more meaningful talks can take place, and a second step, which is to try to recover the moment of the peace talks before the present breakdown. There must be a further step backwards also. They must look at the structural principles on each side. The Palestinian side must be given more to enable it to restore the legitimacy, credibility and influence of Chairman Arafat and the Israelis must be given greater assurance in relation to security if there is to be a withdrawal, as mentioned by other speakers.</P>
    <P>I wish both sides success. It is important, if we are to get to that point, that the international body which is being proposed conducts an impartial investigation. This must be seen to be the case. Let us be clear about this, a body chaired by the United States and to which the United Nations and Norway are attached, is very different from a totally independent international investigation, as originally envisaged. It is interesting that this body lacks any European Union contribution, which is a serious aspect. I hope this body will be successful, even in its imperfect composition when looked at from one perspective. I wish it well and hope it bears fruit.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not over-simplifying the issue. I have described a certain scenario that will serve as a background to the talks. I listened with great care yesterday to the representative of the Israeli Government who spoke thoughtfully. I accept what he said in terms of the risks that have been taken for peace and how the doves rather than the hawks on that side of the conflict need to be supported. I support this view. Given our experience of Northern Ireland, I would regard it as deeply offensive to say to the parties to that conflict that they should forget everything that happened before the present moment in the peace process. It is very different to say to them that they must leave it aside so that we can move on and live together, but it is insulting to suggest that there be amnesia. When I visited Gaza and other towns many years ago, I was very moved by the fact that children playing in appalling conditions were the third generation in a refugee camp. We cannot ask people to leave aside the issues of refugees. There must be a step back to engage the structural issues that will have to be addressed eventually. These include the issue of refugees, the jurisdiction of Jerusalem and what will happen in relation to guarantees for some and withdrawal of settlers in the post-1967 territories. <Col N="891" /> There is also the issue of sovereignty and the recognition of the inalienable right, supported by the international community, of the Palestinian people to a homeland, a state, and, equally, the right of the State of Israel to security.</P>
    <P>We will not help by burying our heads in the sand and saying that because there is a conflict at home we should stay silent. I agree we should be careful but we should also remember that if the international community does not provide assistance in this conflict it could quickly turn into a conflict not just between Israel and Palestine. If there is an imperfect investigation group chaired by the leading power in the world it will be construed as the West versus the rest and within a short time a certain version of the West within geopolitics versus the rest. It would be deeply destabilising in regard to the future of international relations.</P>
    <P>That is why the European Union, instead of making statements late in the day and being afraid to stir itself to condemn that which should be condemned, should move to a mode of activism not just by expressing concern at violence but also in examining the structurally necessary principles to establish an enduring peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker has captured a telling point in regard to the current situation in the Middle East. The lack of any European role could a contributory cause of further tragedy because there is a perception on the Palestine side that the American influence is malign. I do not entirely agree with that sentiment but Palestinians believe the US is not an honest broker and is not involved in a neutral manner in the politics of the Middle East. The more cynical among them might say that the US is only involved because the region has a significant concentration of oil. I do not agree with that cynical theory.</P>
      <P>It would be better if there were a greater European influence in this equation. I congratulate the Minister on the firm line he took in identifying the source of the problem. The<i> casus belli</i> was the totally ill-advised and provocative visit of Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount site in east Jerusalem. This was particularly offensive given that Mr. Sharon is identified in the minds of Palestinians with the horrible massacres at Chatila and Sabra in Lebanon which had deeper consequences than the events of the past few weeks with more than 150 killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is tragic and it teaches everyone in Ireland to be careful in regard to our peace process. Sometimes a peace process can go horribly wrong. The Oslo Accord was the most public peace process. It was announced on the lawn of the White House to great public acclaim. Two figures were on the lawn but one, sadly for all concerned, was tragically assassinated. Mr. Arafat is in a weakened position. There is no doubt there are hotheads on his side who are impatient with his style of leadership and would prefer if he were <Col N="892" /> not in charge, preferring protest and escalating violence. No form of violence is of assistance in this tinderbox in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly remarked that the violence serves nobody in this equation. Hopefully it will end and Mr. Arafat will be able to control the hotheads and prevent them from breaching a ceasefire and both Israelis and Palestinians will respect the right to life. The death toll is horrendous and it has been a horrible episode. It is hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel. One hopes wiser heads will prevail but I have visited the region on many occasions over many years and unfortunately the sight of the resettlement policy is terrible. The policy is aggressive and wrong and rubs the noses of the Palestinians in it.</P>
    <P>They believe their land has been occupied since 1967 and settlements were aggressively sited around their territory. That has continued unabated since Mr. Barak took over. Some Palestinians are even saying they might have been better off with Netanyahu, which is odd. Most level headed international observers believed that Barak's appointment was liberal and there would be a definitive improvement. However, the resettlement policy has continued in an aggressive manner. Mr. Barak was aware of Mr. Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount site and took no action to prevent it. That was an historic mistake on his part, which hopefully can be rectified with the resumption of talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I largely agree with the thoughtful and careful contribution of the Minister. In the context of the difficulties in the Middle East and the tragedy of what has happened over the past three weeks we are aware in making comment of the difficulty in forging a peace process and that frequently as one feels one is making progress there are unexpected setbacks. It can then be extremely difficult to get the process back on track.</P>
      <P>The Minister correctly highlighted that for a peace process to work people who have been in conflict for many years, or generations in some instances, must have the capacity not only to start a peace process but to reach final agreement and implementation and as they move through the framework process there is a need to build and maintain trust and confidence. During the trials and tribulations of implementation periods and initial agreements trust and confidence are often stretched and it is on those occasions that those who are truly committed to finding a way forward and providing a new beginning on both sides of the divide must be at their most courageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely that the visit of Sharon was a provocation that should not have taken place. However, there then followed an extreme reaction from the Palestinians and the violence that erupted provoked a further reaction from the Israeli defence forces. Unfortunately, the rhetoric of peace has been replaced by a rhetoric of hate and conflict, primarily from those opposed to the <Col N="893" /> achievement of an ultimate peace agreement resolving the difficult and outstanding issues that must be addressed, particularly in east Jerusalem and sovereignty over holy places for the different religious groupings.</P>
    <P>Neither side should allow those on the other to oppose a final agreement through provocative behaviour which acts as the catalyst for extreme and disproportionate reaction to destroy the peace process. Such reaction, by destroying trust and confidence, ultimately undermines political support for peacemakers and achieves the objectives of extremists committed to an ongoing conflict. Sharon through his act of provocation has politically undermined public confidence in Barak, an Israeli Prime Minister who has gone further in seeking to resolve and reach agreement on untractable issues than any of his predecessors had the capacity to do.</P>
    <P>The reaction from the Palestinian side was a rhetoric of hate from radio stations and people involved in the Palestinian Authority. There was the release of Hamas terrorists, while Hizbollah on the Lebanese border captured Israeli soldiers. There was also the destruction of Joseph's Tomb. This series of events resulted, tragically, in a substantial number of deaths on both sides, although more Palestinians than Israelis have lost their lives.</P>
    <P>When we consider the situation, it is correct to regret deeply any deaths that occurred on either side. However, one wonders, when counts are done, whether the implication is that we would understand it more if an equal number of people died on both sides. The reality is that, tragically, in the past three weeks, the Prime Minister of Israel, who was committed to a peace process, and President Arafat, who made great strides along the same route of a peace process, have found themselves captured by events that have practically destroyed and sabotaged that process.</P>
    <P>Instead of a concentration on how to bring the process to a completion, which allows both sides to enter into the essential and necessary compromises that are always involved in a peace process, it appears that the focus is on analysing the events that have taken place. The events of recent weeks have done great damage.</P>
    <P>Two points should be made. President Clinton and the Americans have acted as honest brokers. President Clinton has been as politically committed to achieving peace in the Middle East as he has to achieving peace on this island. We in Ireland should not suggest otherwise. It is also important to note that President Mubarak of Egypt in recent days has played an important role in seeking to de-escalate the conflict and making it clear to those who would like it to escalate, such as the Governments in Iraq, Iran and Libya, which have their own agendas, and the Hamas and Hizbollah groups, that war is not a game.</P>
    <P>The summit due to take place in Egypt this weekend should be seen as a further step towards resolving the problem and should not contribute <Col N="894" /> additional rhetoric to escalate the conflict that has occurred recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never more appropriate to support the prayer, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall possess the land&rdquo;. In this instance the peacemakers are entitled to our support, constant reassurance and encouragement in the face of what are for them considerable difficulties in terms of religious fanatics. I take the Minister's point and the sad irony is that the holy places respected by Christianity, Islam and Jewry are now becoming the scenes of violence. We cannot accept this irony or sadness and, therefore, those of us who respect principles based on our prevailing religious ethos or our fundamental respect for rights must stand in support of those peacemakers.</P>
      <P>Two such peacemakers appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday &ndash; I was privileged to be selected by my colleagues to chair the meeting &ndash; the Israeli Ambassador, Mr. Mark Sofer, and the Delegate General of Palestine in Ireland, Dr. Youssef Allan, who is present in the House. Despite, or perhaps because of, the pain, the sorrow and maybe the anger they felt, they were able to give an example in their presentations and concerns of the type of commitment to peace that we are all obliged to support.</P>
      <P>This has always been Ireland's position on this and other issues. I was privileged in 1979 as the then president of the Council of the EEC Ministers to be able to mention for the first time on behalf of the nine member states in my address to the United Nations the Palestinian Liberation Organisation as a party to be consulted. It had never been mentioned before but the formula I found was that Resolutions 242 and 347 had to be respected by all parties to the conflict, including the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way since then because everyone now recognises that its leader, Yasser Arafat, plays a key role. The role of Prime Minister Barak is also key and each of them faces great difficulties because of the mob elements on the Palestinian side and the religious fanaticism on the Israeli side that are evident at times. We have inherited a trace of that on this island. Those of us with deep seated religious views should tell those who use those principles and religion to generate hatred, animosity and disrespect that this is not the way anybody can travel on the path to peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse the views expressed by colleagues. The Minister mentioned the danger of a threat to the stability of the whole region. My view is that it is more than that; it is the danger of a threat to the stability of world peace. The difference between unacceptable violence on this island and in the Middle East is that even if there was full conflict in Ireland, it would not pose the risk of instability even in the European region, let alone the world at large. However, because of the key significance of the region, the current violence <Col N="895" /> poses the risk not only of conflict in the Middle East. Potentially it is only place in the world where there could be the outbreak of universal conflict. Therefore, we all have a stake in it.</P>
    <P>It is not only a matter for the Israelis or the Palestinian people. We respect their rights but it is a matter for every individual citizen in the world and those of us who are democratically elected representatives must make that point. No one can risk an outbreak of violence throughout the world and we have a right and an obligation to involve ourselves.</P>
    <P>The unanimity in the House must reassure the parties who are working towards peace. I share the views expressed by a number of Members that the European Union has a dynamic obligation in this area. I support, as would the Minister I am sure, any move to achieve an active, vigorous and consistent role on the part of the European Union in this area. I was privileged to be involved at that level once and our practice and principle over the years obliges us to continue that role and to have Europe involved as a central peacemaker.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Two weeks ago, it appeared that a new peace agreement was in store between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government. Now a regional war is threatened with incalculable consequences. The reason for this dramatic turn around is the cynical diplomacy and the shameless deals pushed by a super power, the United States, and involving the EU, that have utterly betrayed the aspirations of the Palestinian people. They have also betrayed the aspirations of a majority of the working class people of Israel who have shown that they do not wish to pursue the route of war.</P>
      <P>The agreement in Oslo in 1993 was flawed; it was a fudge and a betrayal of the Palestinian masses. This is now being demonstrated. An agreement which does not recognise and vindicate the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign and independent state is doomed to ignominious collapse. When Sharon, the arch-reactionary butcher of innocent men, women and children in Sabra and Chatila, went to the Temple Mount, he was merely throwing a match on a powder-keg that was already primed to explode.</P>
      <P>Since Oslo in 1993, the position of the mass of the Palestinian people has become worse in terms of poverty and unemployment. In the 1990s, I visited Gaza and the West Bank. I went to the refugee camps, spoke to disenfranchised youths and saw the misery there. Unfortunately, Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority has not addressed one of these problems in a meaningful way. It is, in fact, the basis of an oppressive and dictatorial system where currently heavy press censorship, the rights of journalists and the human rights of activists and strike leaders are frequently transgressed. People are arrested without trial. That is not the state I believe the Palestinians wish to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Who has the solution? Not the Arab regimes who are thoroughly corrupt and more terrified of their own masses than of anything else, nor the United States which is interested only in exploitation and oil. The USA is guilty of massive hypocrisy. How mild was the condemnation of the slaughter of 100 Palestinian youths in two weeks compared to how such an act might have been greeted if carried out by the brutal Milosevic regime. The Israeli State certainly does not have the solution either, as it is answering to Israeli big business.</P>
    <P>There is a possible solution, which is to remove the imperial powers and the corrupt dictatorships. An agreement is possible on the basis of an approach where economic justice and the civil rights of the masses of the people, both Palestinian and Israeli, are respected. That would involve the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign state, the right of the Israeli State to exist &ndash; the borders to be discussed and agreed &ndash; and justice for the millions of Palestinian refugees outside the borders. It is possible to reach a peaceful accommodation on Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>Crucially, the freeing of the mineral wealth and other resources of the Middle East for the benefit of the people, rather than for the dictatorships and the imperial powers, can lay the basis for a solution. Clearly, imperialism offers the people of the Middle East nothing but a future of bloodshed, terror and disintegration. A coming together of the disenfranchised masses in the struggle for socialism can bring peace, freedom and prosperity. That is the solution.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech was typical of the balancing act of Irish foreign policy. He referred to Mr. Sharon's provocative visit, the excessive use of force by the Israelis, and he denounced the murder of the two Israeli soldiers. No one can disagree with those sentiments, but the Minister should have gone further. We are talking about helicopter gunships versus catapults, and about the murder of a 12 year old child cowering behind his father. We are really talking about the disproportionate use of force which the Minister should have condemned unequivocally.</P>

The leading article in last Sunday's <i>Observer</i> newspaper captured the sentiments very well when it stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Palestinians were black, Israel would now be a pariah state, subject to economic sanctions led by the United States. Its development and settlement of the West Bank would be seen as a system of apartheid in which the indigenous <Col N="897" /> population was allowed to live in a tiny fraction of its own country.</P>
    <P>The <i>Observer</i> article went on to say that what we really have there is a system of apartheid where townships are under-resourced, where Israeli Arabs are discriminated against in education, spending and housing, and where the Israelis have the largest proportion of water and electricity which they control.</P>
    <P>We are currently witnessing on the West Bank an extraordinary injustice that has been perpetrated against the Palestinians over a long period. We cannot beat around the bush on this issue. As a sovereign nation &ndash; or what used to be a sovereign nation &ndash; we should have condemned this today.</P>
    <P>The Israelis argue that the Oslo accord seven years ago was an opportunity. It is also argued that at Camp David in July, Mr. Ehud Barak offered a partial handover of east Jerusalem and the placing of holy sites outside Jewish control, in order to get a peace deal. The deal that was achieved, however, fell far short of that. We now have Israel as an intransigent partner in the negotiations. I recognise the difficult situation in which Mr. Barak finds himself, but that is the nature of politics. Equally, I recognise that Yasser Arafat finds himself in a very difficult situation. I am calling for our voice to be heard. We cannot have double standards. When the United States speaks about the freedom of the Serbs, what about the freedom of the Palestinians?</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister talked about our role as peacekeepers. I am quite sure that if the Minister spoke to the peacekeepers in Lebanon they would tell him about the situation as it is occurring on the ground. They would tell him about the people who are in charge there. We are now ending our peacekeeping duties in Lebanon because we are committing our soldiers to the EU rapid reaction force. That says everything about Irish foreign policy at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>This case is a damning indictment of the special school transport system for the handicapped. The pupil involved is just 15 years of age and his medical history is simply tragic. He was born with what is termed the Russell Silver syndrome, a unique form of dwarfism. I understand there are only two cases of this type in the country. The boy also had a hole in the heart which necessitated surgery when he was eight months old. While the cardiac surgical procedure was a success, a clot developed two days after the operation which left him brain damaged and paralysed. In fact, he is both mentally and physically handicapped. He is confined to a wheelchair, needs constant care and attention, cannot feed himself or perform even the simplest of tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> From the age of five until last June this pupil attended a special class in Donegal. Transport to and from the class was organised by the North Western Health Board. Since 1 September he has continued to attend a special class in Donegal, but transport is not being provided at present. His mother has to push the wheelchair almost a mile to school every morning, and walk back home. In the afternoon she has to walk back to the school again to collect her son and push the wheelchair back along the same route. This means that she has to walk approximately four miles per day, or 20 miles a week, to bring her badly handicapped son to and from school.</P>
    <P>The whole area is shocked at the obvious negligence by the Department of Education and Science of this boy's educational welfare. Not alone is it stressful in the extreme for the pupil, but it also imposes the most severe hardship on the family, particularly the devoted and dedicated mother who has to push that wheelchair up the steepest hills in Donegal in all kinds of weather. Things will become worse as we enter the winter months. Last week, both mother and son had to travel the route through torrential rain and gales.</P>
    <P>This has been the situation since 1 September. I have made numerous representations to the Department of Education and Science, so far without success. The latest excuse from the Department is that there is no suitably adapted vehicle in the Donegal town area to accommodate the wheelchair. The only concession offered by the Department is a transport grant not exceeding £150 per year. That simply adds insult to injury.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to cut the bureaucracy and red tape and restore transport entitlement to this pupil from next Monday morning. The Department has had more than two months to prepare for this situation. I understand it was aware in May that this situation would arise, which means it had five or six months. Is this an example of how we are to treat our handicapped? It is past time for excuses. What we need now is action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I empathise and sympathise with the family concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science is aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and assures the House that his Department is making every effort to ensure that the special transport needs of the child in question are met as speedily as possible. He points out that his Department seeks to put special transport arrangements in place for all children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the great majority of cases, the children in question can be accommodated on existing or newly established special school buses. However, in some cases, such an arrangement does not prove feasible due to specific circumstances. The introduction of a certain service may give rise to <Col N="899" /> special problems. For example, the journey time involved in travelling by school bus might be too long for the child or the child may be unable to avail of the service because of the nature of his or her disability.</P>
    <P>In such situations, the Department of Education and Science offers a grant payment to the parents of the pupil concerned to help defray the cost of providing private transport. The amount payable in all such cases is determined by the distance the child has to travel to school and the level of the child's attendance at school.</P>
    <P>In the case in question, the child resides 0.8 of a mile from his school and the Department had sanctioned transport grants to the child's parents and to the parents of other children attending the special class in question. Arrangements were made with the North Western Health Board whereby the board transported the children to the special class and recouped the costs from the grants allocated by the Department of Education and Science. Unfortunately, the health board found it necessary to withdraw its vehicle from this service at the beginning of the school year and this has given rise to the difficulty to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science points out that his Department has already attempted to secure a taxi service to convey the child to school. Unfortunately, I understand that these efforts have proved unsuccessful to date because of the non-availability of a taxi in the area capable of catering for the child's special needs. The Minister also points out that Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport services as agents of his Department, has been requested to investigate urgently the possibility of engaging an alternative vehicle in the area which would be suitable to convey the child in question to school. The Department of Education and Science awaits a response from Bus Éireann on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science assures the Deputy of his desire to have suitable transport put in place for the child in question as soon as possible and that every effort will continue to be made to put the necessary arrangements in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The move from a headage basis to an area basis for headage payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme which was agreed to by the Government has brought about serious injustices and economic harshness for a great many farming families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first problem that emerged was that some 30,000 farmers in disadvantaged areas throughout the country stood to lose substantial amounts of income support. This is at variance with the reason for having a disadvantaged areas scheme in the first place. The scheme was originally brought in when I was a civil servant in the European Commission and was intended to recognise <Col N="900" /> the difficulties of farming in mountain and severely handicapped areas. It was based on the need to maintain population and its fabric and some level of viability of farming in those areas. It was not explicitly a part of the Agenda 2000 agreement that the most vulnerable farmers should lose out on direct income aids and these losses, which were and are involved, go against the spirit of what was agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>When the first problem emerged, that of the 30,000 farmers who stood to lose, there was considerable toing and froing between the Government and the Commission and, eventually, the Government put in place what I can only describe as a partial fix. In spite of the objectives of the disadvantaged areas scheme, it emerged during that toing and froing that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Commissioner Fischler seemed to be on different wavelengths as to the objectives of the scheme. That partial fix provides for compensation for the losses on a declining basis over three years. In the fourth year, and we should never lose sight of this, farmers affected by the first major problem stand to bear the full extent of the loss.</P>
    <P>However, even the partial fix put in place fails to meet the needs of mountain farmers and especially the needs of those who combine a sheep flock with a suckler cow herd. Today, 7,000 such farmers in the most disadvantaged categories and in the most disadvantaged areas of the country face the prospect of losing up to £1,500 next year and every year thereafter. To many people, £1,500 might not seem like a considerable sum of money. To a farm family in a remote mountain area with limited acreage, with or without commonage, and engaged in low return livestock farming, the loss of £1,500 means a sharp drop in its standard of living and in its capacity to maintain the level of operations on the farm.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to the Minister that the Agenda 2000 agreement, which has produced these heavy blows for farmers in the disadvantaged areas, must be deeply flawed. The Minister might argue that it is too late to unpick that agreement and I would not be surprised to hear him say that, but he cannot avoid admitting that he connived in bringing it about. It is up to the Minister to find a remedy which is satisfactory and lasting, not temporary and digressive like the previous fix he put in place. The problem is acute. The effective reduction in the rates of aid is what has caused the problem and it is exacerbated by the fact that the farmers in question typically have small acreages so that even increases in the amount of aid would be of very limited utility in helping them overcome the problem.</P>
    <P>So far, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development appears to have broken his silence on this issue only once and that was, apparently, to give an unspecified commitment to the four so-called Independent Deputies who support the Government to bring a proposal to the EU that will seek to compensate farmers who <Col N="901" /> have lost out on an ongoing rather than on a temporary basis. Bringing a proposal to the EU that will seek to resolve the problem is just not enough. We had that with the previous fix and it took considerable time to sort it out. That is the doctrine of &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo;. What low income families in mountain areas need now is a clear and specific statement of what will be done to ensure that, next year, they receive the same amount of direct income aid as that to which they are entitled today under the disadvantaged areas scheme. Nothing else will be just or acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's intervention in this matter and acknowledge his wide knowledge of the Commission and how it works. The position is that, under the Agenda 2000 agreement, headage grants in the disadvantaged areas are to move from a payment per animal to a payment per hectare basis. This part of the agreement was well signalled at the time. Under transitional arrangements the headage schemes as they have operated up to now will continue to apply for this year. A new area based scheme is to be introduced with effect from next year.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a task force representative of the Department and the main farming bodies, was established to formulate a new scheme. The task force met on a number of occasions and, having considered a range of options, the group recommended a scheme which would involve, <i>inter alia</i>, a payment per hectare depending on the type of livestock on the holding. It was envisaged that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment.</P>
      <P>The group noted that any scheme which does not have a link to production produces winners and losers, whereas the scheme proposed resulted in very little redistribution of aid. We announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. At the same time we announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments. That scheme took particular account of the difficulties facing sheep farmers in mountain areas. Effectively we increased the annual provision for compensatory allowances from £120 million to £140 million over the period 2001 to 2006. The proposed scheme was then submitted to the European Commission as part of the overall rural development plan.</P>
      <P>The Commission was unwilling to accept the scheme proposed, mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The Commission viewed the fact that each livestock unit would attract one per hectare payment as continuing the link to production. In these circumstances the Department examined a number of alternative proposals. The only scheme acceptable to the Commission is one which totally breaks the link with production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme agreed in July and since approved by the European Commission, provides for area <Col N="902" /> related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares and mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he or she will be paid on lowland &ndash; more severely handicapped &ndash; first, lowland &ndash; less severely handicapped &ndash; second, and mountain grazings last. If a farmer has only lowland &ndash; more severely handicapped &ndash; and/or lowland &ndash; less severely handicapped &ndash; his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he or she has a combination of lowland &ndash; more severely handicapped and/or lowland less severely handicapped &ndash; and some mountain type land, he or she will be paid on up to 45 hectares lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an overall limit of 60</P>
    <P>hectares. If a farmer has only mountain type land his or her overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001 to 2006. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001, representing an increase of about £60 million over the current scheme. There are no losers this year since the existing schemes remain in place under the transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 at present to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. We have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
    <P>At the time the new scheme was agreed in July last the Irish Farmers Association in particular acknowledged that the package was balanced and backed by increased resources designed, as far as possible, to securing the incomes of vulnerable sectors, including drystock farmers and both mountain and lowland sheep farmers. The IFA also acknowledged that the new package meets the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the incomes of farmers dependent on disadvantaged area payments will be protected.</P>
    <P>The reality is that moving from an animal based payment system to an area based payments system based solely on the disadvantaged status of the land involves winners and losers. We have asked departmental officials to carry out a review of the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this serious issue because of the major negative impact of the 9% stamp duty and the 2% tax per annum on second <Col N="903" /> properties introduced in the Property Act in June on the recommendation of the third Bacon report.</P>
      <P>When the Property Act was introduced Fine Gael spoke against the tax for two reasons: first, it would have very little impact on first time buyers who are finding it next to impossible to purchase a house in large urban areas and, second, it would reduce the incentive for people coming into the private rental market which would leave less property available for renting and, in turn, drive up rental costs as is happening in large urban areas.</P>
      <P>This Government has failed to put in place the one measure which would allow first time buyers into the market and reduce rents in the private sector, namely, increasing the supply of housing stock. There is a major housing crisis in cities like Dublin, Cork and Galway but in the region I represent the housing issues are vastly different. The BMW region was established by the EU for Objective One status because of the need for future development and to ensure viable population levels which would require the necessary infrastructure and service developments. We are supposed to be receiving preferential funding from EU and central government to sustain and improve our population levels. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance introduced rural renewal schemes for counties Leitrim and Longford, and parts of Sligo, Roscommon and Cavan, as an incentive for much needed outside investment to be attracted into these counties. I have complimented the Minister for this initiative on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>This scheme has the potential to be very successful but since the introduction of the 9% stamp duty and the 2% annual tax on second properties, the interest expressed by investors has dwindled to a trickle. The logic of the Government's policy in this matter is inexplicable and is further proof that no coherent plan is being advanced by it to sustain growth and development in our region.</P>
      <P>Houses for first time buyers are not a problem in the rural renewal scheme area. I contacted three auctioneering firms in Leitrim this afternoon and they informed me that, between them, they have over 100 properties ready to be occupied selling at £80,000 or less. A former Leitrim county engineer whenever asked by councillors to provide houses for bachelors would say, &ldquo;When you provide the bird we'll provide the house&rdquo;. The men can now provide the women but we cannot provide the houses. The Government has a lot of work to do.</P>
      <P>If the Government wishes to help first time buyers it could put in place a policy which would allow them to reclaim all the VAT paid on the purchase of a new house. For example, a house costing £100,000 would result in a refund of £12,500 to the purchaser, a major increase on the paltry grant of £3,000 currently available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural renewal scheme and the BMW areas <Col N="904" /> need property investors. However, since the introduction of the Property Act the purchase of a house for £100,000 has increased from £103,000, including 3% stamp duty, to £115,000. Many potential investors are now looking at property outside the State.</P>
    <P>This proposal has been a dismal failure and before further damage is caused to the housing market I am calling on the Minister of State to give a commitment that the Government will rescind the 9% stamp duty and the 2% annual tax in the budget. If it does not do so the current policy will have the opposite effect to that intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the context for the recent taxation measures on housing, which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, introduced in the Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, is the difficult housing market at national level. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, economic consultants, required prompt action. There was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime is one of the measures designed to help first time owner-occupier buyers. Given the constraints on resources in the building sector at present, there is also need to focus more on provision for people who need homes in which they will live throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, introduced a three-tiered stamp duty structure for first-time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first-time buyers and investors. The exemption from stamp duty was raised to £150,000 in the case of first-time buyers and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000. Rates of duty for first-time buyers at values up to £300,000 will now be 25% less than for other owner-occupiers. The House will be aware that a flat 9% stamp duty rate will now be charged on all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property. The Government decided to apply this rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new and second hand residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stamp duty is a relatively simple self-assessed tax which is applied on a once-off basis. It is not a tax that readily lends itself to exemptions on a regional basis. There is a risk that such exemptions could lead to distortions. These could hinder the overall national goal of increasing the supply of new homes especially to meet the needs of first <Col N="905" /> time buyers who are trying to get a foothold in the housing market.</P>
    <P>The new 2% anti-speculative tax will apply to second and additional residential properties acquired on or after 15 June 2000. The tax will be limited to a three year period. In addition, there are exemptions in specific instances including section 23 type properties under various tax incentive schemes.</P>
    <P>These new measures should also assist in applying resources in the home building sector to the construction of homes for first time owner-occupier purchasers. As the Minister for Finance stated during the passage of the Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, the Government is not prepared to countenance the possible development of a situation where the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant proportion of people who reasonably aspire to it. As well as the social problems that this would cause, it would present difficulties for the wider economy in the shape of adding to wage demands and in reducing mobility in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance considers that the latest package of measures should assist in restoring balance in the market and curbing price-increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector, whether first time buyer, owner occupier or investor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of road safety has not ever been so topical. The death toll on the roads has reached staggering new heights and clearly the time has come for a new approach to how we go about driving and observing both the rules of the road and the laws governing driving standards.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will be aware, part of the problem related to the high level of road accidents is that there continues to be so many young, inexperienced drivers on the road. However, there are also many young drivers who have developed excellent driving skills, but who, because of huge waiting lists for the driving test, continue to drive with an L-plate and pay high insurance for their cars. It is this specific issue that I intend to address this evening.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the waiting times have reduced considerably in recent times, but people are still being forced to wait months before being called. I am currently dealing with a case where a young man has been waiting for more than a year now.</P>
      <P>We require a range of measures to deal with the bottlenecks and ensure that tests can be taken without delays. However, there is an apparent shortage of qualified testers. In test centres throughout the country, there is tremendous pressure on existing testers to carry out tests. It seems, no matter how many tests they attempt to fit in on a working day, the list of applicants does not decrease. If there is to be real efficiency in testing, there must be more testers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kildare South, there is a growing population <Col N="906" /> of young people, many of whom have moved out of Dublin due to rising house prices but continue to work in Dublin. The housing crisis has forced them into car ownership because they must now commute to and from work on a daily basis. Of these drivers, most have gone to the expense of purchasing a decent car which will serve them for the daily commute. In addition, they have forked out money for expensive driving lessons, which now cost between £15 and £25 per lesson. While their driving skills, as a consequence of their lessons, are quite good these young drivers are being forced to pay incredibly high insurance rates. There are many older drivers on the road who are not quite as <i>au fait</i> with the rules of the road as younger drivers. The car insurance bill for a couple with provisional licences, in their early thirties, driving a 1.1 litre car would be in the region of £1,500. This is exorbitant, particularly when one considers that these young people are generally paying more than £600 per month in mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>At this stage, with labour shortages and inevitable difficulties in recruiting testers, it may be time to look at alternatives such as, for instance, contracting out the work to driving schools. In every part of Ireland there are competent driving testers who have set up driving schools. There must be a means by which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government could allow the tests to be carried out by such people. In any case, I would argue for new targets for waiting lists. The financial burden on young commuters should not be made worse by the shortcomings of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I wish to thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of the progress that is being made in improving the delivery of the driver testing service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has increased its tester corps from 66 to 107 giving a present capacity to carry out in excess of 200,000 tests per year. This increase in testing capacity is already producing much needed improvements in the service. The average national longest waiting time has reduced from a high of 41 weeks at the beginning of last year to its current level of 24 weeks. The waiting list has shortened by over 16,000 from its highest point in 1999. This improvement has occurred as a result of a number of measures taken by the Department. As indicated earlier, additional testers have been recruited. In addition, there is increased productivity from testers arising from a number of productivity agreements now in place. Overtime testing is delivering extra output. A bonus scheme has also been agreed with the tester and is <Col N="907" /> delivering extra tests, a net output of 14,000 tests is expected to result from this initiative.</P>
    <P>This improvement is happening against a backdrop of increasing numbers applying to do the test. Present indications are that about 176,000 applications will be received this year. This compares to 153,400 applications in 1999. Steps have already been taken to recruit an additional 20 testers. All of these should be in place by spring of next year. However, a number will be fully trained and available for duty in January 2001.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the need to provide a test<Col N="908" /> ing service which is responsive to customer needs. The driver testing customer service target is that an applicant will not have to wait any longer than ten weeks for a test. We believe that this target will be met by mid-2001 or shortly thereafter. I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I assure him that both the Minister and the Minister of State are committed to taking the measures necessary to ensure that a quality service is provided to those wishing to take a driving test.</P>

      <QRef>[22508/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): The subvention to CIE in 2000 amounts to £115.2 million. The allocation of this subvention between the separate companies is a matter for CIE.</P>
    <P>I understand that the CIE board has allocated £13.4 million to Bus Átha Cliath in 2000. The allocation is not at present related specifically to particular levels of services. I recently published a Government consultation paper entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport which includes a wide range of reform proposals. Among them is a proposal to establish a transitional regulatory authority whose functions would include the allocation of public transport subvention through public service contracts.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern for improved integration of public transport services. There is a particular need to improve late night services and the CIE companies are developing proposals for enhanced service in the run up to Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 17 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> I am, of course, fully aware of the congestion experienced at certain times at Dublin Airport over the summer months and of the frustration on the part of passengers who were using the airport particularly at peak times. I expressed my concern in relation to this matter to the chairman and the chief executive of Aer Rianta when I met them last month to discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>This congestion was due to a combination of a number of factors including the major building programme under way at the airport, the strong growth in passenger numbers and the arrival and departure, at peak times, of large numbers of flights.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the measures which both I and Aer Rianta have taken will alleviate congestion at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is investing over £350 million in a major expansion programme at the airport which will provide greater comfort for the ever increasing number of passengers. This expansion, the main elements of which are now substantially complete, includes additional capacity in the arrivals area and baggage hall, new check-in desks, equipment and technology and new exits and entrances. New and expanded catering services are also being provided. This programme will double capacity at Dublin Airport to 20 million passengers per annum. Initiatives have also been taken by Aer Rianta, pending completion of the expansion programme at the airport, to ease congestion and to ensure that safety standards are fully maintained.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, last month I designated Dublin Airport as a &ldquo;co-ordinated&rdquo; airport and my Department has since appointed Airports Co-ordination Limited to take over the function of co-ordinating landing and take-off slots. ACL has already commenced work at Dublin Airport and will be involved in agreeing the flight schedules of the various airlines for summer 2001. Up to now, the function of co-ordinating take-off and landing slots at Dublin Airport was handled on a voluntary basis by Aer Lingus on behalf of the airlines using the airport, but such an arrangement is no longer adequate given the huge growth in passenger traffic and aircraft movements. Passenger traffic at Dublin is expected to reach almost 14 million this year compared to just eight million as recently as five years ago.</P>
    <P>My Department has also engaged a firm of international civil aviation consultants, SH&amp;E, to conduct a study at Dublin Airport which will assist me in determining whether the airport should be designated as &ldquo;fully co-ordinated&rdquo;. A &ldquo;fully co-ordinated&rdquo; airport is one at which airlines are assigned specific, time-designated slots by the co-ordinator. This study, which will focus on capacity issues at Dublin Airport, is required under the EU Council regulation governing slots and SH&amp;E have now commenced their work. The study will take several weeks to complete following which there must be a period to allow the airlines to express their views and comments on the consultant's report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> My decision to designate Dublin Airport as a co-ordinated airport, coupled with the expansion programme being pursued by Aer Rianta will contribute to a significant easing of the pressures on facilities at the airport and result in a greater degree of comfort for passengers.</P>
    <P>In the wider context, I am continuing to give careful consideration to the findings of the Warburg Dillon Read report on Aer Rianta. I am conscious that early decisions are desirable in relation to these matters and that such decisions should ensure that necessary investment projects for Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports over the next three years can be funded by Aer Rianta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 16 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, £21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broad-band to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to £147 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and <Col N="912" /> services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    <P>A competition has been run by my Department to allocate the first £77 million of the funding. The competition process was executed over the summer months, with a closing date of 22 September last. Given the liberalised nature of the telecommunications sector, the competition was run on the basis of public sector co-funding of network extensions to regional areas where it would not be commercially viable to do so at this point in time. The competition criteria specifically award points for the provision of services in deficit areas and the removal of regional barriers. Such criteria promote the inclusion of rural areas and villages in project proposals by telecommunications operators.</P>
    <P>An extensive mail-out of information surrounded the call for proposals. All communications operators were informed of the possibilities presented by the competition for developing broad-band networks in the Border, midlands, west and south and east regions. Business and community leaders throughout the BMW region in organisations such as chambers of commerce, local authorities and development agencies were also informed of the opportunities available through both the lobbying of and the developing of partnerships with telecommunications companies. A large number of project submissions from the regions have been received. The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants under the competition criteria. It is anticipated that contracts on selected projects will be signed before the end of the year and work on further extensions to broad-band networks will start early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 36 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government authorised me on 14 December 1999 to initiate a process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus <Col N="913" /> Group plc and also authorised me to arrange for exploratory discussions with the Aer Lingus unions on increasing the current level of employee share ownership, not to exceed 14.9%.</P>
    <P>Since the Government's decision, the Minister for Finance and I have engaged Schroders Salomon Smith Barney and AIB Capital Markets as the joint global co-ordinators for the transaction. Other advisors necessary to facilitate the implementation of the IPO have also been engaged. The Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, to provide the legislative framework to enable the IPO to proceed has been published and has passed Seanad Éireann. The Bill will be considered by Dáil Éireann in due course.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made on the terms of an increased shareholding for Aer Lingus employees in the context of the IPO. However, some issues remain outstanding which will not be resolved until the current industrial relations difficulties in Aer Lingus have been settled. Indeed, as I indicated to the House earlier this week, it is clear that further progress in relation to the IPO generally cannot take place until those difficulties have been resolved.</P>
    <P>I believe that they can and should be resolved speedily, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. On that basis, I expect that the IPO can take place next spring, subject to satisfactory finalisation of all preparatory work for the IPO and market conditions at the time.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government's policy for air transport generally is concerned, this policy is anchored on three central tenets. These are: the maintenance of the highest safety standards by Irish airlines and airports as overseen by the Irish Aviation Authority; the facilitation and encouragement of as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry; and ensuring that Irish airports are cost effective and have sufficient high quality infrastructure to meet the current and future needs of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>The accident was the subject of a public inquiry held in the Four Courts in June 1953 before the late Judge Thomas Teevan SC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry found that the Aer Lingus DC 3 aircraft on a scheduled flight from Dublin to Birmingham on January 1, crashed at Spernal <Col N="914" /> near Birmingham with the loss of the aircraft. There were no fatalities.</P>
    <P>The inquiry found that the captain was responsible for the accident by allowing both engines cut out by feeding from the same fuel tank which ran dry.</P>
    <P>The captain's license was endorsed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the effect of which prohibited him from flying passenger aircraft. The license was restored without prejudice in 1977.</P>
    <P>The late captain's family now seek the quashing of the verdict of the court and officials of my Department are in contact with them. I believe that these discussions should shortly result in an agreed mechanism for a structured review of the issues which are of concern to the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 33, 47 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from concerns over the impact of increased fuel prices on the road haulage industry a meeting was held between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Irish Road Haulage Association on 13 September 2000. The meeting was held in advance of a day of action by hauliers to highlight their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that meeting it was recognised that the taxation of fuel could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary policy. It was also recognised that there are other non-tax pressures which impact on the sector and a high level task force was established representing relevant Departments and the IRHA to identify <Col N="915" /> issues and propose response strategies to address these pressures.</P>
    <P>The work of the task force process is based on a report published by the Department of Public Enterprise entitled A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry. The recommendations from that report which relate to my Department are already being implemented in consultation with IRHA and IBEC.</P>
    <P>The impact of the task force consideration will be to heighten awareness of and accelerate the implementation of these strategies for the sector while identifying and addressing wider pressures.</P>
    <P>The task force will complete its work within a number of weeks and proposals for a programme of action will be put to Government for consideration. I am confident that, with the support of Government and the Irish Road Haulage Association, implementation of this programme of action and of the wider recommendations of the strategy for the development of the industry will lead to a stronger road haulage sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Economic growth in recent years is reflected in high levels of growth in demand for electricity by all sectors of the economy, averaging around 6% per annum.</P>
      <P>The chairman of ESB has given me a categoric assurance that there will be no shortfall in the electricity supply this winter.</P>
      <P>Current levels of growth in demand for electricity will require the provision of between 150 and 200 of additional capacity each year for the foreseeable future, by means of new plant or imports over the interconnector.</P>
      <P>An additional 160 generating unit came on stream at Poolbeg earlier this year and the new 120 peat plant at Edenderry will come into operation in the next few weeks, six months ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> The decision by ESB to lease five 22 generators is an operational decision by the company designed to give it maximum flexibility in meeting demand this coming winter.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, introduced by me, about 30% of the electricity market is now open to competition. This will rise to 40% in 2002, with full market opening in 2005. This accelerated approach to market liberalisation means that we are, in fact, going beyond the minimum requirements for market opening laid down in the Electricity directive.</P>
    <P>Prospective power producers can apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary authorisations and licences to build new plant to supply eligible customers. In view of the high level of interest shown by prospective entrants to the electricity market, there is every reason to believe that sufficient capacity will be built to meet market demand in the short to medium term.</P>

      <P>There has been correspondence between CIE and my Department on the company's financial position. The company has indicated that it is encountering a worsening financial position due to large cost increases that cannot be recouped out of revenue growth. The cost increases arise in part due to the ongoing provision of increased levels of service, particularly by the bus companies. The company has also incurred significant revenue losses due to the bus and rail disputes this year and is incurring increased costs as a result of wage settlements. The company's funding requirements are at <Col N="918" /> present being considered as part of the Estimates process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by local interests, including the tourism sector, regarding the future of the Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Kerry air routes. Indeed, I have received numerous representations on behalf of both counties and I recently met with a large delegation from the Kerry Access Group on the matter, including a cross-party group of Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>The invitation to interested airlines to tender for the public service obligation, PSO, routes linking Kerry and Galway with Dublin was published in the EU Official Journal by the European Commission on 16 September and the closing date for submission of tenders was Tuesday of this week, 17 October.</P>
      <P>Under the EU regulation which governs the operation of the PSO regime, member states are required to re-tender for air services at least every three years. The current contracts with Aer Lingus in respect of the Galway and Kerry PSOs expire in January of next year.</P>
      <P>As this is a formal tendering procedure conducted in accordance with the requirements of the regulation, Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to make representations to any particular airline in relation to this matter. The tender process was open to all interested air carriers on a fair and equal basis and it was a matter for the airlines to decide whether or not they wished to participate. As Deputies may be aware, however, Aer Lingus recently announced their intention to submit a tender in respect of the Kerry PSO route.</P>
      <P>In all, four airlines, Loganair, Irish Air Transport Limited, Aer Lingus, and Aer Arann submitted tenders covering the six PSO routes which were the subject of the tendering exercise and these will now be evaluated by my Department.</P>
      <P>Both the Kerry and Galway PSO routes have been highly successful in building traffic on those routes and they have benefited tourism and business interests in both regions. Because of this success, I decided that the PSO standards governing those two routes should be increased compared to the current operations and I was able to secure the approval of the EU Commission for these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Galway, I increased the number of daily return flights from three to four while on the Kerry route the number of rotations will be increased from two to three flights each day. I also increased the minimum daily seat capacity to be provided on the Kerry route by 50% to 300 seats, that is, 150 each way. The Galway route already had this level of capacity which is being <Col N="920" /> maintained. As is the case at present of course, there will be nothing to prevent the air carriers providing extra seating capacity on the routes if circumstances warrant such increases. In addition, I am maintaining the requirement for pressurised aircraft to be used on both of these routes.</P>
    <P>I am confident that significant benefits, both for business and tourism interests in Kerry and Galway, will flow from the improved level of access that will pertain when the new services become established early in the New Year.</P>

      <Quest>the health risks that the public are exposed to due to radioactive and other pollutants being discharged from Sellafield, UK; the impact such discharges has had on the health and well being of the public over the past number of years especially when there were high discharges from the Sellafield plant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumption of fish and shellfish is the main pathway through which the public is exposed to radiation as a result of Sellafield discharges and assessment of the health risks is determined from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, monitoring programme. The RPII's September 2000 Report on Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment presents the results of the marine monitoring programme carried out in 1998 and 1999 by the RPII. The RPII report points out that the committed effective doses to heavy consumers of seafood due to artificial radioactivity were 1.42 microsieverts in 1998 and 1.33 microsieverts in 1999, which may be compared with a dose of approximately 70 microsieverts in 1982.</P>
      <P>Discharges from Sellafield of the radionuclude, technetium-99 to the marine environment increased steeply between 1994 and 1997 and were at their highest in 1995. However, the low radiotoxicity of technetium-99 means that it is generally of lesser radiological significance than caesium-137 and accounted for under 25% of the radiation dose to seafood consumers in 1998 and 1999. The RPII's monitoring report shows that for the first time since 1994 a decrease in the mean activity concentrations of technetium-99 was observed in north-east coastline samples during 1998 and this trend continued in 1999.</P>
      <P>The recent RPII report states that the level of radioactive contamination which prevails at present in the marine environment does not pose a significant health risk to the public and does not warrant any modification of the habits of the public in Ireland with regard to consumption of seafood or any other use of the amenities of the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that it is the view of the RPII that <Col N="921" /> it is not possible to quantify any increase in cancer incidence in the Irish public, which might be attributable to discharges from Sellafield. This is because the much larger number of cancer cases arising from other causes would mask the number of such cases.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly stated that any contamination of the marine environment, due to an installation from which Ireland derives no benefit, is highly objectionable from an Irish viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Public perception of the impact of radioactive discharges on the legitimate uses of the sea such as marine-based livelihoods and the enjoyment of the sea's amenities has influenced international efforts to reduce significantly marine discharges. The OSPAR strategy on radioactive substances commits the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic to achieving &ldquo;close to zero&rdquo; radioactive discharges to the sea by the year 2020. I will be doing everything possible to ensure that this strategy is implemented within the timeframe laid down through progressive and substantial reductions in discharges.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the accelerated deployment of renewable energy technologies, particularly in the field of electricity production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999, I set a revised target of an additional 500 MW of renewable energy-based <Col N="923" /> electricity generating plant to be delivered by 2005.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, removed any legal impediment to independent participation in generating and selling green electricity. Consequently, it is now open to the private sector to grow the market beyond the ambitious minimum target I have set.</P>
    <P>More recently, I established a renewable energy strategy group to consider the obstacles to the increased deployment of the wind energy technology which is the most competitive of renewable energy-based electricity production methods at this time. The group's report, including recommendations on investing funds secured by me under the national development plan for renewables, has been published and is being considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The strategy group has also recommended the continuation of special support measures for renewable energy. As this may constitute State aid under community law, it will be necessary to notify proposals to the European Commission for clearance. The preliminary steps in this regard have already commenced. I am most anxious that this procedure be concluded as quickly as possible so that I can submit proposals to Government and publish a detailed policy quickly.</P>

The &ldquo;Dublin Suburban Rail Strategic Review&rdquo; completed in January this year by Ove Arup and Partners on behalf of CIE looked at the possibility of upgrading the freight line from Navan to Dublin via Kingscourt and Drogheda in comparison with other options to link Navan to Dublin. The upgrading of the existing line was not recommended because it would mean a circuitous rail route to Dublin with a journey time of about 75 minutes and, without improvements to the northern suburban line, there would be capacity constraints on the Drogheda-Dublin element of the route. Accordingly Iarnród Éireann has no plans, at present, to upgrade this rail line to passenger carrying standard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that pipelines falling within the ambit of my Department's responsibilities relate to natural gas and that I have no function in relation to oil pipelines.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Gas Acts at present, anybody wishing to construct or operate a natural gas pipeline in Ireland must apply to me for consent to do so. The Gas Acts allow me to attach conditions relating to specified codes and standards of safety or efficiency to any consent to construct, operate or maintain a pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gas technical standards committee set up by my Department in 1981 advises the National Standards Authority of Ireland on what Irish standards and codes of practice are necessary for products and processes used in the gas industry, with particular regard to safety. The standards <Col N="925" /> cover all aspects of the supply and usage of natu ral gas. Adherence to these standards and codes would be among the conditions which would be attached to any consent given to construct or operate a natural gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, I have appointed an authorised officer to carry out certain functions including the inspection of energy infrastructures. This provision enables me, through the appointment of an authorised officer, to oversee energy operations that are capable of being a source of risk to the public or the environment and to ensure that they are conducted in conformity with good industry practice and in accordance with statutory requirements. I believe that these arrangements afford a high degree of importance to safety in the treatment of gas pipelines.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna now hold over 14,000 acres of cutaway bog. It is estimated that between 86,000 and 100,000 acres will become available over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Government is satisfied that the diverse uses to which Bord na Móna has put available cutaway to date, that is, grassland, forestry and wetland, is the right approach for the future development of the cutaway bogs with both commercial and amenity uses being catered for.</P>
      <P>The key recommendations from the 1991 report of the expert committee on the future uses of Bord na Móna cutaway were that research should continue into the afforestation of the cutaways and that the ecological processes that underpin the development of wetlands on cutaway should be researched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1998, the Government launched a new forestry research programme, BOGFOR, to seek ways to improve existing afforestation and to maximise the productivity of future crops. This collaborative research programme is funded by the forest service, Coillte, and Bord na Móna and managed by the forestry ecosystem research group in University College, Dublin. This programme has now completed almost three years work successfully but obviously because of the <Col N="926" /> slow nature of forestry no definitive conclusions can be reached as yet.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade Bord na Móna have, with the support of EU structural funding, developed 3,000 acres of wetlands which include over 60 acres of deep angling lakes. The wetland developments have occurred mainly in County Offaly at the Boora parklands. This development includes angling lakes stocked with coarse fish, bird hides and walking routes and has won international and national acclaim.</P>
    <P>It has recently come to my attention that a further area of potential development on cutaway bogs would be the exploitation of underlying sand and gravel deposits. Bord na Móna is currently assessing the opportunities for development in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1990 the rail network has benefited from considerable grant assistance from both the EU Cohesion and Structural Funds, and more recently from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, a provision of £500 million has been allocated for investment in mainline rail. This investment comprises two principal components: completion of the implementation of the railway safety programme 1999-2003, as approved by the Government in March 1999; a renewal-upgrading programme.</P>
      <P>There is also a major suburban rail investment programme under the national plan.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is confident that £100 million of investment under the railway safety programme will be achieved in 2000. The track renewal programme is on schedule to meet the 2000 target of 87 miles. In relation to level crossings, Iarnród Éireann is concentrating on those with the highest risk and expect to have completed 96 level crossings by year end.</P>
      <P>Sixty diesel railcars have been ordered for delivery in 2002-03. In addition, 12 DART carriages have been ordered for delivery in 2002 with an option for a further 36 carriages. Planning work is progressing on other projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in the mainline rail network under the previous National Development Plan 1994-1999 was focused on track renewal, modern signalling systems and rolling stock in accordance with the overall policy framework set out in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99. The suburban rail programme concentrated on rolling stock acquisition, upgrading of the infrastructure and the provision of new stations. Funding for the rail investment was augmented sub<Col N="927" /> stantially during 1998 and 1999, due to the reallocation of EU aid and the provision of direct Exchequer support. Most of the programme has been completed and the balance is largely on schedule for completion by end 2000. The main exception is the mini-CTC signalling project.</P>
    <P>The programme of mainline rolling stock acquisition &ndash; 32 locomotives and 14 carriages &ndash; under the operational programme has been completed. This included two locomotives and 14 carriages for the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service.</P>
    <P>Under the 1994 to 1999 programme work has been completed on track renewal, modern continuously welded rail on concrete sleepers, on the Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Galway routes. The track renewal on sections of the Waterford, Tralee and Sligo lines was also completed on time and further investment is taking place under the current plan.</P>
    <P>The improved quality of service resulting from these investments has attracted more customers to the rail mode and passenger carryings are now at record levels.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in annual rail passenger numbers of 2.3 million in the period since the start of the operational programme 1994 to 1999. This compares with a targeted increase of 800,000 over the six year period of the programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to suburban rail, the construction of new suburban railway stations has been completed at Clontarf Road, Kilcock and Drumcondra and these are operational. Kilbarrack station has been upgraded and a new station at Barrow Street is under construction. A programme of station platform upgrading is also near completion. Work on park and ride facilities was completed at Killester, Bray, Donabate, Rush and Skerries stations.</P>
    <P>The DART network has been extended to Greystones and Malahide. Interim services are in operation, but the introduction of full services is awaiting the resolution of industrial relations difficulties.</P>
    <P>Twenty six additional DART carriages and 20 diesel railcars have also been delivered. Four of the DART units are in service, a further six will enter service shortly and the remaining DART and diesel units are undergoing testing and commissioning and will enter service in early 2001.</P>
    <P>Work is well advanced on doubling and resignalling the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and will be completed by year end. Additional services will be operated on the Maynooth corridor from January 2001. Work is also under way on upgrading the Dublin/Mullingar railway line.</P>

      <P>A number of competing private sector shipping companies provide shipping services to serve Irish importers and exporters. These companies have been innovative in their provision of jumbo ferries, fast ferries and dedicated container ships to serve the growing Irish economy.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is at present any lack of shipping capacity on the sea routes serving Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries' recent commissioning of a shipyard to build the world's largest cruise ferry, for service on the Irish sea, is one indication of the dynamism of the Irish shipping sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's recent initiative, setting up by statute in December last a new dedicated Irish Maritime Development Office &ndash; IMDO &ndash; within the Marine Institute, with the following remit: to promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services; to promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration; to develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary service sector and to liaise with and support the industry and advise on policy initiatives and overhaul of the legislative framework for the mercantile marine so as to underpin industrial development and safeguard and generate employment.</P>
      <P>An expert advisory group for the Irish Maritime Development Office, comprising representatives of the shipping industry and shipping services sector, IDA Ireland, independent financial, legal and business people and Departments, was formally established in December 1999.</P>
      <P>The IMDO is now finalising its first report which it will present to me shortly. This report will, <i>inter alia</i>, set out proposals aimed at promoting the development of Irish shipping and shipping services and at attracting to Ireland additional marine related service sector operations and major players in the sector's manning, technical, chartering, legal and financial areas.</P>
      <P>The IMDO provides the Government with the means to address any issues of concern which might arise regarding the adequacy of shipping capacity serving the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that policy in relation to ports is to provide sufficient capacity to meet the growth in demand for shipping services and to allow for competition between shippers, to the benefit of importers and exporters, in that context.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the question of delivering television services over telecommunications networks such as Eircom's copper network. The Director of Telecommunications Regulation is, at present, carrying out a public consultation on whether this is appropriate, or even possible, in the context of the development of new technologies known as xDSL. In the circumstances, in would not be appropriate for me to comment on this specific issue.</P>
      <P>On a more general note, it is an objective of the European Communities policy relating to electronic communications that there should be fair competition between all available platforms and in the provision of services over those platforms. The European Commission has published a package of proposals setting out a new regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector which encompasses this objective.</P>
      <P>Discussions on these proposals have begun within the Council and the European Parliament and officials from my Department are fully engaged in these discussions at council working party level. I will, of course, be making my views known at the Council of Telecommunications Ministers when the various directives that comprise the proposed framework come up for discussion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my response to Questions Nos. 32 and 79 of 20 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The national plan provides for £2.2 billion of investment in public transport in the period 2000 to 2006. A sum of £1.6 billion has been allocated specifically for the greater Dublin area for the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Funding for regional transport and on mainline rail development amounts to £750 million. This is primarily aimed at improving mainline rail safety and enhancement of regional bus and rail services.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office recently published a transportation strategy for the period 2000 to 2016, which identifies both short and longer term transport investment requirements. Earlier this year, I announced Government approval in principle for the development on a PPP basis of a metro. Preparatory planning work is already under way.</P>
      <P>My Department is also actively involved with local authorities in the Cork, Limerick and Galway regions in relation to planning, land use and transportation studies. These studies will bring forward public and other transport proposals for the relevant areas. I will be favourably disposed to supporting these proposals, where they are fully integrated with coherent land use development strategies and where they provide for the implementation of effective traffic management and bus priority measures.</P>
      <P>Developments expected in the coming months in Dublin include: the entry into service of ten new DART carriages. Four of the DART units are in service; the remaining units will enter service by mid-November. They also include entry into service in spring 2001 of a further 16 DART carriages which have been delivered and are undergoing commissioning, and the introduction of full services on the DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide following the resolution of industrial relations difficulties. Work is well advanced on doubling and resignalling the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and will be completed by year end. Additional services will be operated on the Maynooth corridor from January 2001.</P>
      <P>Work is also under way on upgrading the Dublin/Mullingar railway line. Four Quality Bus Corridors are in operation in Malahide, Stillorgan, Lucan and Finglas and two more for Clondalkin North and Rathfarnham are due for completion year end. The new Barrow Street DART station will open before the year end. Fifty of 100 additional buses have been delivered and the remainder are on target for delivery by the year end.</P>

      <P>A further 16 DART carriages have been delivered and will enter service in spring 2001 following commissioning. Twelve DART carriages are on order, to be delivered late in 2001 or early in 2002, with an option for a further 36 carriages.</P>
      <P>This programme of investment in the DART fleet is being cofunded by the Government and the European Union. There has been no increase in capacity since DART was introduced in 1984, but the combination of delivered carriages and confirmed orders will increase capacity by almost 50%. Daily DART passenger numbers have increased by approximately 267% from 30,000 passengers in 1984 to over 80,000 at present.</P>

      <Quest>when she will sanction the £61 million capital investment by Aer Rianta in Cork Airport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22725/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta funds its capital development programme at each of the three State airports without recourse to the Exchequer. The company is proceeding with its planned expenditure programme of over £60 million at Cork Airport, and assures me that the main elements of these plans remain on schedule.</P>
      <P>The investment plans for Cork Airport comprise four main elements &ndash; airfield, passenger terminal, cargo facilities and access, and the current status in relation to each of these elements is as follows.</P>
      <P>As regards the airfield, the main runway has already been overlaid with asphalt and widened by the provision of 7.5 metre shoulders on both sides along the full length of the runway. This upgrades the existing concrete surface and extends the life of the runway by 15 to 20 years. This work cost £6 million and was completed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An apron extension together with the provision of a new taxiway and the upgrading of an existing <Col N="935" /> taxiway will commence before the end of this year. This project will cost £8 million and will take approximately 18 months to complete. When completed, it will provide more aircraft parking spaces and will facilitate the parking and handling of larger aircraft than can be accommodated at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the passenger terminal, the plan is to increase terminal capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per annum by 2003 and to facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle growth up to five million passengers per annum in the medium to long term. A dedicated design team is working on the specification of this new facility. Aer Rianta is examining several options and consultations with users, especially airline and handling companies, are ongoing. The work will continue until the end of 2003 and will be followed by further phases. An estimated £33 million will be spent on the initial phase of the work, approximately £5.5 million next year, £5.5 million in 2002 and the remainder in 2003.</P>
    <P>Work on cargo facilities is planned to commence midway through 2002 and be completed within 18 months with no delays expected. This work entails the provision of a new taxiway and aircraft parking area to the south of the terminal at a cost of £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to airport access, the development plan includes a new internal roads system and the provision of surface and multi-storey car parking. A topographical survey has been commissioned as part of the essential preliminary preparations for these works. Surface car parking and the road works project will commence early next year, with the multi-storey development following on at the end of 2001. By the end of 2003, approximately £12 million will have been spent on these developments.</P>
    <P>The growth in passenger traffic at Cork, far in excess of all forecasts, has created new pressures on the infrastructure. While there will be additional car parking and aircraft parking capacity for summer 2001, the terminal extension will not be in place for a further two years. In the meantime, Aer Rianta informs me that it is engaged in ongoing consultations with airport users to identify and implement short-term measures to alleviate congestion. These include a better spread of flight times, especially holiday charters, to optimise the use of existing facilities.</P>

      <P>With regard to the proposals for a single EU-US air traffic agreement, this issue has <Col N="936" /> been the subject of discussions in the Transport Council since 1996. The European Commission has been seeking a full mandate from the Council to negotiate an EU-US traffic agreement. In these Council discussions I have been, and will continue to be, opposed to the concept of such an agreement, because I believe it would restrict our ability to negotiate regulatory arrangements with the US to suit Ireland's needs specifically.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that the Transport Council will agree during this presidency or the next to give the Commission the mandate it seeks.</P>

      <P>I believe that, following the amendments made to the draft regulation by the Council and by the European Parliament's industry committee, the proposals achieve these aims and will help ensure that there is fair and sustainable competition in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on several occasions that questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas. The following is the position in relation to the commercial State companies under my aegis:</P>
      <P>The Government authorised me on 14 December 1999 to initiate a process leading to an Initial Public Offering &ndash; IPO &ndash; of shares in Aer Lingus Group plc and also authorised me to arrange for exploratory discussions with the Aer Lingus unions on increasing the current level of employee share ownership, not to exceed 14.9%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government's decision, the Minister for Finance and I have engaged Schroders Salomon Smith Barney and AIB Capital Markets as <Col N="937" /> the joint global co-ordinators for the transaction. Other advisers necessary to facilitate the implementation of the IPO have also been engaged. The Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, to provide the legislative framework to enable the IPO to proceed has been published and has passed Seanad Éireann. The Bill will be considered by Dáil Éireann in due course.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made on the terms of an increased shareholding for Aer Lingus employees in the context of the IPO. However, some issues remain outstanding which will not be resolved until the current industrial relations difficulties in Aer Lingus have been settled. Indeed, as I indicated to the House earlier this week, it is clear that further progress in relation to the IPO generally cannot take place until those difficulties have been resolved.</P>
    <P>I believe that they can and should be resolved speedily, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. On that basis, I expect that the IPO can take place next spring, subject to satisfactory finalisation of all preparatory work for the IPO and market conditions at the time.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to give careful consideration to the findings of the Warburg Dillon Read report on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta with a view to bringing specific recommendations to Government in this regard as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to privatise the IAA, which was incorporated as a commercial State company in 1994 and is the safety regulator and the provider of air navigation services in Irish-controlled airspace.</P>
    <P>There are currently no plans with regard to a flotation of Bord na Móna plc.</P>
    <P>There are currently no plans with regard to the flotation of ESB. I have, however, written to the chairman of ESB in relation to the future positioning of the company in the liberalised electricity market and I have invited the board to let me have its views on the future direction of ESB including future ownership, alliances and strategic partnerships. The board of ESB discussed this matter at a meeting this week and agreed to consider the matter further in the new year.</P>
    <P>There is no current timetable for BGE's privatisation. However, I have written to the chairman of BGE concerning the company's future structure and ownership and I have invited the board to put forward its views on the impact of liberalisation on BGE's structure and related issues such as public-private partnerships and future ownership. The BGE board is still considering these aspects and I would expect to hear from them later in the year.</P>
    <P>I should also add that draft legislation is currently being prepared to establish BGE as a pub<Col N="938" /> lic limited company to allow it greater freedom to operate in a liberalised market.</P>
    <P>In relation to An Post, the Government has given its approval for that company to initiate negotiations on a strategic alliance with a suitable postal operator in view of the changes in the postal sector in the EU.</P>
    <P>However, privatisation is not currently envisaged or planned for An Post.</P>
    <P>In regard to the CIE group of companies, the consultation paper entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport published recently by the Government sets out a number of proposals in relation to the restructuring of the CIE companies including the possible privatisation of the bus companies.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Government's decision of 23 February 1999, INPC initiated an extensive search process to identify business development opportunities to underpin the operation of the Whitegate refinery.</P>
    <P>Four definite proposals were submitted to the INPC. The INPC board recommended the submission received from the Tosco Corporation to acquire the refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal. The proposal involves a commitment to operate the facilities in question for a minimum of 15 years. The consultants who are advising me in relation to the proposed deal subsequently endorsed that recommendation.</P>
    <P>On 31 July 2000, I announced that I had authorised INPC to enter into a period of exclusive negotiations with the Tosco Corporation for the sale of the refinery and the oil terminal. The National Oil Reserves Agency is not included in the terms of the sale.</P>
    <P>Currently, both principals are working to move the initiative forward to a successful conclusion. My Department and the Department of Finance, with the assistance of external consultants, continue to monitor the situation to ensure that shareholder concerns are adequately addressed as the negotiations proceed.</P>

    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): As I said in my reply to private notice questions on 17 October 2000, I am very much aware of and regret the inconvenience caused to Aer Lingus's customers as a result of industrial disputes in the company, particularly in relation to the 24-hour stoppage of Tuesday last. I also very much regret their effects on the tourism, consumer and business sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>In my earlier reply, I outlined the position regarding each of the disputes. In relation to the cabin crew who took industrial action last Tuesday, I am pleased to advise that both Aer Lingus and their union, IMPACT, have been invited by the Labour Relations Commission to talks this afternoon, 19 October 2000.</P>
    <P>Direct talks between the company and representatives of baggage handlers, clerical and catering staff are also taking place this week. It is my hope that progress will by made during these discussions and, if necessary, speedy reference of any outstanding matters can be made to the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court as the case may be.</P>

      <P>The growth in demand for electricity continues to be managed competently by ESB. The categoric assurance which I have received from the chairman of ESB about the adequacy of the power supply situation this coming winter remains valid.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 160MW unit which is now operational at Poolbeg and the new 120MW peat plant at Edenderry which will come on stream in the next few weeks, ESB have taken an operational decision to lease five 22MW standby generators which will maximise the flexibility available to the company in meeting demand this winter. The question of power shortages this winter, therefore, does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from small scale renewable energy projects, ESB currently has approximately 4500MW <Col N="941" /> of installed generating capacity provided by the following 18 power stations:</P>

    <P>In relation to proposed generating stations, prospective power producers apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary authorisations and licences in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. ESB have received an authorisation from the commission and have commenced construction of a new 400MW gas fired plant at Ringsend. Details of other applications and their status can be found on the commission's website at www.cer.ie.</P>
    <P>In summary, and as I indicated previously, the current capacity situation is being managed professionally by ESB. As regards the future, I am confident that the additional capacity required by economic growth will be provided by the industry, based on projects currently planned or in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>The national transmission grid will itself require very significant investment to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and liberalised market.</P>

      <P>However, I can confirm that, as part of the process for the proposed licensing of third generation mobile telephony operators that is now being undertaken by the office of the director, I will be examining the question of what public service requirements, if any, should be included in those licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an existing railway connecting Connolly and Heuston stations via the Phoenix Park tunnel.  Due to track capacity constraints in the city centre it would not be possible to route existing commuter trains on the Kildare line through Heuston and on to Connolly Station. Connolly Station currently caters for the Maynooth line and northern line suburban trains, DART and mainline rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy for transport in the greater Dublin area for 2000 to 2016, A Platform for Change, addresses the <Col N="943" /> longer term strategy to overcome these constraints, through the construction of an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station via Pearse Station to the docklands and linking to the Maynooth and Northern lines. This was also identified as the preferred solution in the Dublin suburban rail strategic review study commissioned by CIE and completed earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Pending implementation of individual commonage framework plans, farmers with commonage land were required to reduce ewe numbers by 30% under the terms of an interim commonage framework plan.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The context for the recent taxation measures on housing, which I introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2000, is the difficult housing market situation at a national level. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants, required prompt action. In particular there was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime is one of the measures designed to help first time owner-occupier buyers. Given the constraints on resources in the building sector at the present time there is also need to focus more on provision for people who need homes which they will live in throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a flat 9% stamp duty rate will now be charged on all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property. The Government decided to apply this rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new and second hand residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable <Col N="948" /> development from the point of view of the first time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is a relatively simple self-assessed tax which is applied on a once-off basis. It is not a taxation that readily lends itself to exemptions on a regional basis. There is a risk that such exemptions could lead to distortions. These could hinder the overall national goal of increasing the supply of new homes especially to meet the needs of first time buyers who are trying to get a foothold in the housing market. The tax incentives which I introduced in the Finance Act, 1998, and the Finance Act, 1999, referred to by the Deputy, far outweigh the once-off charge to stamp duty arising on the purchase of an investment property in a designated area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new 2% anti-speculative tax, this tax will apply to second and additional residential properties acquired on or after 15 June 2000. The tax will be limited to a three year period. In addition, there are exemptions in certain circumstances including 'section 23' properties under the rural renewal scheme for the upper Shannon area.</P>
    <P>These new measures should also assist in applying resources in the home building sector to the construction of homes for first time owner-occupier purchasers. As I stated during the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act, the Government is not prepared to countenance the possible development of a situation where the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant proportion of people who reasonably aspire to it. As well as the social problems that this would cause it would also present difficulties for the wider economy in the shape of adding to wage demands and in reducing mobility in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I consider that the latest package of measures should assist in restoring balance in the market and curbing price-increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector whether first time buyer, owner occupier or investor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 466 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for an allowance of up to £220 at the standard rate of income tax in respect of a dependent <Col N="949" /> relative. A dependent relative is a relative of the claimant, or of the claimant's spouse, incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself, the widowed father or widowed mother of the claimant or of the claimant's spouse, whether incapacitated or not, or a son or daughter of the claimant who resides with the claimant and on whose services the claimant, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend.</P>
      <P>If the dependent relative has income in his or her own right, the maximum allowance of £220 is reduced by £1 for every £1 by which the dependent relative's income exceeds £5,536 in the current tax year.</P>
      <P>If the father referred to by the Deputy is a dependent relative for the purposes of section 466, tax relief may be claimed under section 469 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 in respect of health/medical expenses incurred by the father.</P>
      <P>Home nursing expenses are treated by the Revenue Commissioners as follows. In cases of serious illness where qualified nurses are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient's home, relief under section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, may be allowed where the following conditions are satisfied: (1) a medical certificate is provided which (a) shows the nature of the patient's illness, (b) states that constant nursing care by fully-qualified nurses in the patient's home is required, and (c) covers the full period for which home nursing is being claimed; (2) the nurses providing the nursing care are fully qualified and their full names, addresses and qualifications have been supplied; (3) receipts are provided in respect of all payments to the nurses and, where necessary, a breakdown of the payments is provided; this is to ensure that relief is given only in respect of the amounts paid which directly relate to the rendering of nursing care and not to the nurse's expenses.</P>
      <P>Depending on the circumstances of the family referred to by the Deputy, covenants may be effective in providing tax relief. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated adults. Income covenanted by the children to the father will effectively become the income of the father who can then claim tax relief on health/medical expenses he incurs.</P>
      <P>Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for a tax deduction of up to £8,500 in a year where a relative or relatives of an incapacitated person employ a carer to care for the incapacitated person. As the carer must be employed, there is an obligation to deduct the statutory deductions from emolument paid to him-her. However, where the carer is employed through an agency, it is normal for the agency to pay the carer and to deduct the statutory deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home carer's allowance introduced by section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, would apply in certain circumstances. This <Col N="950" /> allowance of up to £3,000 at the standard rate of income tax may be claimed by a married couple, provided they are jointly assessed, where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependent persons which includes children, the aged or incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Act, 2000, I undertook to review the issue of a tax relief for individuals who contribute to the cost of assisting with the upkeep of a dependent relative, an aged person or an incapacitated person in the context of the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill and I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind in this context.</P>

In addition, the contracts to provide community pharmacy services under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, set out certain procedures to be followed in the dispensing of prescriptions by pharmacists.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. Further work is now being undertaken to develop a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The second phase of the review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I propose to take a number of initiat<Col N="955" /> ives in the current year to alleviate anticipated service pressures over the winter period. It is my intention to announce these measures shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department does not routinely collect data which would identify young people attending coronary care units or their personal details such as their weight patterns. However, Building Healthier Hearts &ndash; the Cardiovascular Health Strategy report does contain 211 recommendations aimed at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Ireland over the coming years. The successful implementation of this strategy will reduce the number of people including young people attending coronary care units.</P>
      <P>The SLÁN survey provides data on the weight and height of young people. The results show that 23% of children, 18% of boys and 28% of girls, expressed the view that they needed to lose weight. The SLÁN survey also highlights that 62% of boys and 45% of girls are exercising four or more times a week, outside of school time.</P>

      <P>The professional body responsible for standards and practices in pathology in Ireland, the faculty of pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has circulated guidelines which cover consent arrangements for post-mortem examin<Col N="957" /> ation and, in particular, the retention of tissue/organs for further diagnosis, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post-mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and the guidelines have been issued to all members of the faculty.</P>
      <P>The chief medical officer of my Department wrote to the chief executive officer of each health agency on 9 December 1999, asking them to ensure that a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post-mortem and retention of tissue/organs, operates in each health agency.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the guidelines of the faculty of pathology, which will ensure that tissue and organs will only be used for diagnostic, treatment and research purposes where explicit consent has been obtained from next of kin, will form the basis for best practice in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department wrote to the chief executive officer of each health board and voluntary hospital on 17 December 1999 asking them to put arrangements in place to respond to the needs and support requirements of all parents and families who may have concerns arising from the practices and procedures that were applied to that date. Each chief executive officer was also advised that an assurance had been given to the &ldquo;Parents for Justice&rdquo; support group that financial support would be provided in individual cases to families who wish to make private arrangements for interment of retained organs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have established an inquiry into post-mortem examination, policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970. The inquiry in question will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be chaired by Ms Anne Dunne, Senior Counsel, who will present me with a report of the inquiry's findings within six months. On receipt of this report I will then table a motion that it be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a clinical diagnosis. There is no test for establishing the presence of the condition. The diagnosis, assessment and treatment for ADD-ADHD are provided for children by consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists and for adults by consultant psychiatrists. The consultant determines the appropriate treatment, refers patients to appropriate services and prescribes medication if required.</P>
      <P>Out-patient clinics staffed by consultant-led, multi-disciplinary teams are deemed the most appropriate treatment setting for persons suffering from ADD-ADHD. Additional revenue of £3 million has been provided for child and adolescent psychiatry since 1997 primarily for the development of dedicated consultant-led, multi-disciplinary teams. Each health board now has a dedicated team in place and services continue to be developed. Adults who have been identified as suffering from ADD-ADHD are treated within the adult psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The organisation of services for the treatment of ADD-ADHD will be considered as part of this review. The group is expected to issue an interim report later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory provisions governing roadside trees and vegetation are contained in section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993. These provisions oblige landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that trees, shrubs, hedges or any other vegetation on their land are not, or could not become, a danger to road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a local authority considers that a hazard exists, it may serve notices on landowners and occupiers of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority itself can carry out the works specified in the notice in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply with it. The authority may also carry out additional works which it considers necessary. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local authority can act at once, without serving a <Col N="961" /> notice, to remove or reduce the danger. In either case, the local authority may recover the cost of the works from the landowner or occupier.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these powers are properly designed to enable local authorities to take necessary action in relation to roadside obstructions. At the same time, local authorities have been advised in my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads and elsewhere that, in the exercise of these powers, they should also be aware of their responsibilities in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities. Other relevant statutory provisions include the Wildlife Act, 1976, for which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority publishes annual road accident facts, based on road accident information recorded by An Garda Síochána, the latest copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. While the publication includes statistics by type of collision &ndash; table 18 &ndash; there are no statistics available on road deaths or accidents which relate specifically to overgrown ditches.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under it. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs associated with the purchase and-or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds is given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant varies in <Col N="963" /> the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
    <P>I understand that the group indicated in the Deputy's question has made an application under this year's scheme seeking funding of £17,700 towards the cost of providing security equipment for 59 households. The southern regional office of my Department is currently assessing the application and will be in touch with the group in due course.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend it.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will have the child benefit in the case of twins increased to double the normal payment; and if he will have any increases in child benefit paid out from May each year rather than September.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births is as follows. Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, CB was payable at the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, CB was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1998, I introduced two key additional measures designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of CB payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal CB rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full-year cost of £4.8 million and fully fulfilled our commitments made on the issue prior to the election.</P>
      <P>In the interim, I have provided for very substantial investments in the CB scheme. The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million, while the most recent budget provided for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million annually. Additionally, the Government has made a commitment to substantially increase the payment in the lifetime of the PPF, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates rose to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements have benefited all families with children, including families with twins, and represent, in <Col N="964" /> my view, the most effective use of the available resources. The cost of providing for the double CB payments for twins is estimated at £5.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the timing of CB increases, it should be noted that the effective payment date of the increase coincides with the start of the school year in September and the increased financial burden faced by parents at this time. In recognition of the fact that approximately 40% of children are in families who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments, the Government has brought forward the implementation dates of payment of weekly social welfare rates on a progressive basis since we took office.</P>
    <P>Next year, general social welfare increases will be paid in April to coincide with the start of the tax year. In 2002, in line with the change of the tax year to the calendar year, the effective payment date of social welfare increases will be brought forward to January, a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office. Those families, who consist of the families in greatest financial need, will benefit from receiving an increase in their social welfare weekly payments progressively earlier in the next two years.</P>
    <P>Whereas the effective date of child benefit increases has not been brought forward, the continued thrust of improvements in the monthly rates, in line with the PPF commitment, will result in gains for all families, including as already stated, those families with twins.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the named individual farms land in two SAC sites, the Mweelrea/Sheefrey Erriff Complex &ndash; site number 1932 &ndash; and the Maumturk Mountains &ndash; site number 2008.</P>
      <P>My reply on 5 October 2000 referred to his land in the Maumturk Mountains site, as the Deputy's question provided no exact location in connection with his query. This particular appeal could not be processed as the landowner had yet to supply the requisite map of his land. It was assumed that this land was the subject of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of land in the Mweelrea/Sheefrey Erriff Complex the landowner was advised on 3 February that this appeal was being referred to the SAC Appeals Advisory Board, which I established to enable landowners to have their objections examined independently of the staff of my <Col N="965" /> Department. As this appeal was being dealt with by the board, separate from Dúchas, it was not recognised as being the subject of the question asked on 5 October 2000.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the landowner will be advised of the outcome of this appeal within the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the aspects of the question which fall within my area of responsibility for wildlife and habitats. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will reply to an identical question tabled by the Deputy in relation to roadside hedges and deal with issues which are the responsibility of his Department.</P>
      <P>While hedgerows are a vital habitat for many nesting birds and also operate as repositories of biodiversity, I am conscious that hedges need to be properly managed in the interests of road safety. Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, makes it an offence to cut, grub or otherwise destroy vegetation between 15 April and 31 August which is the critical bird nesting season but local authorities are exempted from the section 40 provisions.</P>
      <P>This year, as in previous years, Dúchas the Heritage Service of my Department wrote to all local authorities in early March requesting their co-operation in ensuring that hedge cutting takes place, where possible, outside the period commencing 15 April and ending on 31 August.</P>
      <P>I am happy to confirm that the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which will amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, completed Committee Stage on 17 October 2000. This Bill had proposed to extend the period during which cutting was restricted from 15 April to 31 August to the 1 April to 31 August each year. On Committee Stage, I proposed that this period would be further extended to cover the period 1 March to 31 August each year. This amendment will further enhance the protection that is afforded to birds that nest in hedgerows.</P>

      <P>Invitations to tender for the supply, installation and commissioning of a Garda CCTV system in Cork city were advertised in the national press and in the supplement to the Official Journal of the European Communities. The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 10 August 1999. The tenders were then evaluated and I approved the placing of a contract for the Cork City CCTV system with SKS Communication Limited in December 1999.</P>
      <P>A meeting of all the parties concerned (i.e. my Department, Garda Síochána, Cork Business Association, ESB, Cork Corporation, SKS Communication Limited) took place in January 2000. Camera sites were surveyed to determine the optimum location/positioning of the cameras and to identify the owners of any buildings where cameras and equipment were to be placed.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a problem was discovered in relation to the underground ducting for cables, and I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the ducting problem is currently being resolved.</P>
      <P>As regards Garda personnel, the detailed allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner. For my part I have increased the number of gardaí to record levels. The force has been increased from 10,800 in 1997 to 11,600 at present and I have just authorised a new recruitment campaign that will bring the number to 12,000 by 2002. CCTV allows the more efficient use of existing resources and, therefore, should be a net contributor rather than a drain on resources. The level of monitoring required in a particular area depends on a number of operational factors and will be determined by the Garda authorities.  </P>
      <P>The question of monitoring CCTV generally is under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

Details of the number of tickets issued as well as the number of Northern Ireland drivers who are prosecuted are not readily available and it would require a considerable amount of Garda time to compile such information.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the question of whether or not there should be a prosecution in a particular case is a matter for the Gardaí and, where appropriate, the Director of Public Prosecutions and my Department has no statutory role in the matter. Also, the decision as to whether or not a fine on the spot is issued in a particular case is a Garda operational matter and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>In general, since fines on the spot for speeding were introduced in December 1996 there has been a very high voluntary payment rate without the need for court proceedings. Details in relation to the issue of fines on the spot for speeding by Garda region are available in the annual report of An Garda Síochána and copies of the 1999 report were recently circulated to all Deputies.</P>

      <P>Since I have taken office, I have increased the number of gardaí from 10,800 in 1997 to a figure of 11,600 this year. Last week the Government approved my proposals for a Garda recruitment competition later this year and the recruitment of 500 Garda trainees from that competition in the year 2001. This latest recruitment competition will fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to <Col N="972" /> increase the strength of the force to a record level of 12,000.</P>
      <P>The amount of money provided in the Garda Síochána Vote has increased from £457 million in 1997 to £670 million this year, an increase of nearly 50 per cent. Provision has been made for nearly £45 million in Garda overtime this year. This substantial allocation recognises that the nature of Garda work and the requirement that the Garda authorities respond at short notice to crisis situations.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has never been so well resourced as it is today.</P>
      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to an individual area is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that the current personnel strength, all ranks, in the Dublin metropolitan area is 3,623.</P>
      <P>While crime &ndash; as measured by the number of recorded indictable offences &ndash; fell nationally in 1999 as compared to 1998 by 5 per cent, crime fell in the Dublin metropolitan area by 8 per cent, the biggest reduction in crime in any of the six Garda regions. Within the Dublin metropolitan area, crime fell in each of the six divisions.</P>
      <P>A national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has recently been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. The operation is focusing on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, under age drinking, illicit drug use and under age alcohol sales. Locations of recurring incidents are receiving particular Garda attention with the emphasis placed on high visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also utilised to the full.</P>

      <P>The primary focus of the young people's facilities and services fund has been on local drugs task force areas where the heroin problem is most acute. In these areas, development groups, comprising representatives from the local drugs task force, local authority and VEC were established to develop integrated plans on the basis of detailed guidelines approved by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. These plans were considered by the national assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which evaluated them and made recommendations on their funding to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. All funding earmarked for the local drugs task force areas under the current phase of the fund has been allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the eligibility of the club in question for funding under the fund, the national assessment committee agreed in December last, on foot of a request from the development group in Finglas-Cabra, that a proposal submitted by the club at that time would be considered in the event of funding being decommitted from within the existing plan for the area. This would be on the basis that the development group itself prioritised the proposal for funding. This decision was conveyed to the development group at the time. <Col N="974" /> To date, no proposal has been received from the development group for the decommitment of funding from within the existing plan.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the procedures agreed in 1995, the assessment arrangements for phase four consists of two separate occasions of testing. Because some institutes have conducted both of these occasions of testing at the end of phase four the TUI, on behalf of its members, are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing on the basis that such testing constitutes a terminal examination.</P>
      <P>Circular Letter IT 9/99, dated 6 August 1999, instructed institutes of technology to ensure that they adhere in future to the procedures agreed in 1995. Specifically they were instructed to ensure that there would not be any terminal examination at the end of phase four. As an exceptional measure, in the interests of resolving the matter, my Department authorised Institutes to make a once-off examination payment in the 1998-99 academic year where examinations had taken place at the end of phase four.</P>
      <P>Since Circular Letter IT 9/99 was issued my Department has been in contact on a number of occasions with the institutes of technology involved in the apprenticeship programme and has had communications with representatives of the TUI in an effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>Most recently, my Department wrote to the TUI on 15 September proposing that the union withdraw the instruction to its members regarding the submission of results for phase four assessments pending the outcome of an external syllabus review for phases four and six which has been initiated. In this letter it was pointed out that, arising from this review, the current assessment system for phases four and six may need to be modified to take into account syllabus changes and new practice in a number of trades. The TUI has not acceded to this request and efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the condition of St. Fergal's boys national school, Cappagh Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11, which has suffered serious deterioration due to vandalism and lack of investment by his Department; if his attention has further been drawn to INTO concerns that the school is a health hazard and has threatened to withdraw teaching services if conditions do not improve; the amount of capital funds in total available to his Department in 2000; the overall amount allocated to primary schools; the amount allocated to Dublin primary schools; the reason capital funds cannot be made available for improving such poor facilities given the enormous budget surplus; and if he will outline his plans to take immediate steps to address deficiencies in this school building.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department received an application from the school authorities to have improvement works carried out at St Fergal's boys national school, Cappagh Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11 and I am aware of the INTOs concerns in the matter.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested the Office of Public Works to provide a technical report in order to determine the extent and cost of the works to be carried out at the school. As soon as this report is received the matter will be progressed immediately.</P>
      <P>The capital funding allocated to the primary and post-primary school sectors this year was £193 million. Of this amount, £81 million is available to the primary sector. Since 1999, 19 primary school projects, each costing in excess of £250,000, commenced in the Dublin area at an estimated value of £9.5 million. In addition, my Department approved over 130 minor grants this year for improvement/ refurbishment works in primary schools in the Dublin area. The estimated value of these grants is £5 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in 2000, each primary school has already received a basic grant of £3,000 plus £10 per pupil to carry out minor improvement works to national school properties under the devolved grant.</P>
      <P>In relation to major capital projects, the availability of funding is only one of a number of factors influencing the rate of progress to construction. This depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and by my Department, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and a fire certificate and the outcome of the tender competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These processes are by their nature lengthy and complex and can take a considerable period of time to complete. Delays can arise at any point in the process, consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will <Col N="979" /> proceed to construction. However, every effort is made by my Department to minimise delays and to ensure that construction is started in the shortest period of time possible. In all cases, the school authorities will be kept informed of progress.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 261 of 10 October 1999, his attention has been drawn to the fact Fingal County Council has not included any plans for secondary school buildings in its area action plan for the old Phoenix Park racecourse; if his Department was consulted on these plans; if he will arrange for his Department to clarify this matter with an official from Fingal County Council given the acknowledgement in his reply that there is already a lack of places and that further education provision at first and second levels is required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Officials of my Department's planning section regularly meet their counterparts in Fingal County Council with a view to identifying the need for additional educational provision and reserving sites for schools as necessary. The objective is to ensure that there is adequate provision at first and second level in a given area to meet current and anticipated demand for pupil places.</P>
      <P>Based on the pace and extent of housing development in the Dublin 15 area, my Department has concluded that further educational provision will be required and has asked Fingal County Council to reserve a number of sites for first and second level schools. These sites are in the Castaheany, Phibblestown, Porterstown and Diswellstown areas. The council has also been requested to reserve a site for a primary school on the old Phoenix Park racecourse. No reservation for a postprimary school has been made on the old Phoenix Park racecourse site because my Department is of the view that a second-level school in that area will not be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1999, my Department established the national educational psychological service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; following a Government decision that an educational psychological service should be provided to all schools and to certain other recognised institutions. The general aim of NEPS is to assist in facilitating all students to develop to their potential and to maximise the benefits of their educational and other experiences, having particular regard to those having special educational needs. NEPS is organised in collaboration with the clinical services provided and funded by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NEPS agency is currently embarking upon a development phase which will last for five years. At the end of that time, all schools will have access to the service offered by the agency. The current situation is that all post-primary schools and approximately 725 national schools are served by NEPS. This number will be sub<Col N="981" /> stantially increased by the end of the year 2000 as additional psychologists join the agency.</P>
    <P>In those schools served by NEPS, the educational psychologists take referrals of children suspected to have attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They work in collaboration with teachers and parents and use agreed diagnostic criteria in order to identify children with these syndromes. In most cases, they refer these children on to clinical services for further advice, to enable a full diagnosis to be made and support to be provided by a multi-disciplinary team. The educational psychologists continue to provide advice to the teachers of children with ADD or ADHD on educational programmes and behavioural management. As stated above, this service will be available to all schools as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A total of 7571 leaving certificate grades were appealed this year out of the total of 415,586 grades issued to candidates. Following the appeal process which involves a complete remarking of the candidate's work by a different examiner there were 2,309 upgrades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> As the Deputy will be aware, in the interests of greater openness and transparency I arranged for candidates to have access to their marked examination scripts in all subjects. As a result candidates were able to inform themselves prior to appeal regarding the application of the marking scheme to their scripts and were empowered to make an informed decision regarding the need to appeal.</P>
    <P>As is the norm, the appeals process was used again this year as a further quality assurance check on the original marking. Where during the appeal process a chief examiner has a concern in relation to the original marking he-she can have the entire work of the examiner concerned remarked. Arising from this additional quality assurance measure 441 upgrades were awarded to candidates who had not appealed.</P>
    <P>The number of grade changes therefore represents just over half of one per cent of the number of grades originally issued. This low level of grade change points to a very high level of precision in the marking process.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the case of a boy in respect of whom the court made an order on 12 October to have him detained in Mountjoy Prison. This order was subsequently quashed and the boy was released. An order was then made to have the boy committed to Trinity House on Friday 20 October when a secure place will be available.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to have convicted children accommodated in appropriate facilities as required by the courts, difficulties do occasionally arise in accommodating placements for individual children on the first date on which placement is sought in any particular unit due to pressure on places on a given day. In general, the child in these circumstances is either subsequently placed in that unit or in one of the other facilities as an alternative to, or pending the availability of, a place in the original unit of preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has embarked on a major five-year development plan, which includes proposals for the refurbishment of existing facilities and the development of additional capacity. Overall, the plan envisages the development of up to 30 <Col N="983" /> additional places for young offenders. In addition, the residential services board which is proposed under the Children Bill, 1999 will, <Col N="984" /> ensure the effective and co-ordinated delivery of services for children at risk, both in terms of services provided by my Department and the special care units provided by health boards.</P>
