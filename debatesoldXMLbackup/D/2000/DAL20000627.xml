      <P>The Chair and the House will be aware that Deputy Lawlor publicly announced his resignation from the Fianna Fáil Party. He stated that he did this with sadness and reluctance as he did not wish his position within the party to be used to distract from the workings of Government. I appreciate Deputy Lawlor's public spirited approach at this difficult time for him and his family. I equally appreciate his pledge of continued support for the Government.</P>

Those are his words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 2000, my Department has received 98 freedom of information requests. Of these 98 requests, only three were refused. In 17 cases there were not any records in the Department to release. There are seven requests on hand awaiting decision. It is not possible from the records available to give an average time taken to process and adjudicate on requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach now agree that the Freedom of Information Act is positive legislation which has benefited the citizens? Is he aware of the concerns expressed by the commissioner for that institution as recently as 8 June about the serious backlogs of processing caused, in part, by a substantial increase in the number of applicants, up from 3,000 to approximately 11,000, but, more critically, because of a chronic shortage of staff? Is he aware of that utterance by Mr. Kevin Murphy and does he have any intention, as Taoiseach, to address the problem of staff shortages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said it would, in the House last year, the Act is settling down. While there were some concerns, as the commissioner's determinations are made, it is giving more confidence to the various officials dealing with the Act. A constructive approach has been taken by the staff and the information commissioner and that has helped ease the concerns which were there at an early stage. The Act is running far more smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct that the number of cases is up because of the extensions outside the original remit. The workload is up. Those concerns have been signalled by the Information Commissioner in this regard in view of the average monthly increase which he said was 60% last year <Col N="80" /> over 1998. He also made the point that he would continue with the issue of staff. He has received an increase of 75% in the number of investigators. However, with the additional areas and the expansion in the number of bodies within the remit, I gather that is an ongoing discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to the Information Commissioner's comments to the effect that there was anecdotal evidence at least that decisions and discussions that previously would have been recorded in writing are no longer recorded in that form for fear of possible disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act? Will he make a statement indicating his disapproval of any such tendency to deal with matters orally or by telephone where they are without the purview of the Freedom of Information Act, rather than as is appropriate in writing where they are more certain as to their meaning and more accessible under the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Commissioner indicated that he had anecdotal evidence that this might be the case in some instances but that he had never come across an actual case. He also indicated that he expected Departments to keep a proper audit trail of documents to enable them to give reasons for decisions.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I consider it essential that Departments maintain adequate records to enable them to carry on their business. As a Minister I found the traditional records very useful because a file goes through a Department and different sections of the Department have different views on legislative proposals, answers to correspondence, budget submissions or whatever. The practice over the generations has been to write manuscript notes on the files. I always found it very useful because it was only when one received the file and followed the manuscript notes that one got a sense of the arguments for and against within the Department, the pluses and minuses. I always went back through those notes rather than reading the final note which is obviously written by one individual. The assessments are always in the manuscript notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach write on files?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, many times. All my replies would have been manuscript notes. I do not think I ever used a typed note. I would not like to see that and I hope that practice, which was very good and helpful, is not ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the issue of staff and the massive delays referred to by the Information Commissioner in the report I cited. I asked the Taoiseach if he had any plans to increase the staff numbers above and beyond what is currently in the pipeline, and I am not sure he replied. Perhaps he might reflect on that <Col N="81" /> question given the extension of the application of the Freedom of Information Act and the fact that 62% of members of the public are using this democratic facility, and not journalists, business people or other groups who might have a professional interest. Citizens are using this facility, as was intended, but that is not to take away from other uses. Will the Taoiseach agree the Act is being spancelled through lack of staff? Will he indicate that extra staff will be made available, above and beyond what has been promised or is in the pipeline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally refute the idea that the Act is being spancelled. There has been an enormous increase, from nil to 11,000 cases. In my Department practically all the cases and requests have been dealt with within the statutory period. I cannot answer for every Department but I have seen replies from other Departments which would indicate the same. The figure is 11,000 questions, which is an enormous amount. The bodies and their remit have been extended. Last year the Minister for Finance gave approval for an additional 75% of staff. I know informally that further approaches are to be made to the Minister for Finance about staffing in the light of the expansion this year. I think that fully answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Percentages are one thing but numbers are another. We are talking about three in four people in terms of absolute numbers. Does the Government support the implementation of this legislation which 62% of the public wishes to utilise? The commissioner stated in his report, published on 8 June this year, that staff shortages are grossly delaying the response and the information cannot be given within four months. Will the Taoiseach raise with the Minister for Finance, if he is still talking to him, the question of additional staff to enable this legislation to be properly and efficiently implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My note indicates there is no application for additional staff. I do not like to say that. The number of investigators has been increased to seven. There is an informal note that there may be an approach&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He admitted the office is grossly understaffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if there is an approach it will be favourably considered by the Minister, as he approved 75% extra staff last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply to my earlier supplementary question, how will it be possible for the commissioner to get evidence that officials are not putting matters in writing to avoid disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act? Surely by definition, when matters are not put in writing there is no record of them and, therefore, the evidence of their exist<Col N="82" /> ence cannot be ascertained. What steps does the Taoiseach propose to take to ensure that this matter is dealt with and that people put matters in writing which were put in writing before the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should be making decisions on anecdotal evidence. Outside my Department, notes are still being received in writing. I do not see any change. The practice of the Departments I have served in was that one would get as much on manuscript notes as one would on written memos. I took the commissioner's comments to relate to the fact that this process might have ceased. He mentioned anecdotal evidence, there is no factual evidence that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not have factual evidence. One cannot prove the existence of something that does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He said he had not seen any file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They do. If one picks up a working file which goes through any Department, one will quickly see if the practice of manuscript notes has stopped. The commissioner said he has not seen that the practice has stopped but he has heard anecdotal evidence that it has in some areas. He would deal with an enormous amount of files so obviously it has not stopped in the files he has seen, which is clear from his comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the issue is not whether notes are in manuscript or typed form because obviously they can be in either? What would suggest a change in practice is if each officer on the ascending level through which a file passes did not write his or her opinion on the file. For example, if there was an executive officer recommendation and no expression of a view from the higher executive officer, that would indicate the higher executive officer did not want to be recorded on the issue. Whether that was recorded in handwriting or type is irrelevant. The issue is whether an opinion is recorded at each level. Is there evidence of gaps in the chain of expression of opinion in the preparation of a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence of that, certainly not in my Department.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the reason we have a Cabinet Handbook that describes the arrangements for Ministers in the conduct of business at meetings is to give tangible reality to the doctrine of collective responsibility that is enshrined in the Constitution, and that collective responsibility, by its very description and title, means that decisions are taken collectively and together, not in serial form where a Minister, perhaps the Minister for Finance, or perhaps the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, serially picks off one Minister after another without anybody else hearing the question being posed and without any possibility of collective wisdom being allowed to offer its view?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would caution your intellection, with due respect. I invite the Chair to look at the text of my question and see if I am asking a question about the procedure set out in the handbook. I am not referring to any particular individual decision. I am talking about a method of decision-making which is enshrined in the Constitution of this Republic which talks about collective responsibility. That cannot be done in the dark, in a confessional manner, with one Minister after the other. That is the point I am making. I am asking the Taoiseach whether he has a proposal to change the procedures that are set out in this handbook. That is the question on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Let me make a few points. Deputy Quinn says he is not referring to any particular decision. The Cabinet Handbook incorporates the Cabinet procedures and is issued for the guidance of Ministers and to facilitate the dispatch of Government business. It is not a statutory or regulatory instrument. It is entirely a matter for Government as to how Cabinet business is conducted. That is how it has always operated. Neither is it uncommon for the Government to deal with issues which come before it even though all the Cabinet procedures may not have been complied with. That is the Government's choice and it is free to change the procedures as it sees fit. I replied earlier to a particular instance raised by Deputy Bruton and I said the focus of the procedures was to provide for adequate consultation by Ministers on issues to enable them discharge their collective responsibility, the exact point being made by Deputy Quinn. In the instance referred to by Deputy Bruton there was collective Cabinet responsibility.</P>

Paragraph 2.20 of the same handbook specifically states that where an appointment is being made by the Government to a body to which the Government has nominating power, that a memorandum should be prepared and circulated one month in advance. Does the Government intend changing the method of decision making as set out by way of recommendation in the document, which is non-statutory but which constitutes the wisdom of successive Governments, wisdom which perhaps the current Administration wishes it possessed? It sets out a way of doing business which respects the Constitution. Since the method of appointment which the Taoiseach described did not adhere to the procedures in paragraph 2.20 or 2.21, does the Government have&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunities for all staff. I am fully in favour of reform in the area of gender equality and the development of a new equality policy to address the issue of participation of women in higher grades.</P>
      <P>The percentage of women in my Department at assistant principal level and principal officer level for the years in question is as follows: in 1987, 20% of assistant principals and 11% of principal officers were women. In 1997, 33% of assistant principals and 43% of principal officers were women. This represents an increase over the decade of 13 and 32 percentage points, respectively. These figures compare favourably with those of other Departments where the average rate of female assistant principals in 1997 was 22.7% and the average rate of female principal officers was 14.8%. Our current figures for female assistant principals in 2000 has risen to 45% which well exceeds the numerical target set by the Government of one third of assistant principal posts to be filled by women over the next five years. This is not to say that my Department has become complacent and every effort will be made to achieve parity with male representatives in these grades.</P>
      <P>My Department is in favour of a balanced representation of women in all grades and has a series of measures in place to encourage their career development and advancement. The IPA has been contracted to deliver a comprehensive career development training programme for all grades up to and including principal officer level this autumn which includes training in management and assertiveness skills. We have commenced our training programme for the implementation of the new performance management and development system in the Department which will address the career and development needs of every member of staff. The system is designed to clearly identify the role and range of competencies that each person requires to do his or her job.</P>
      <P>We have introduced measures to facilitate staff who are trying to reconcile the demands of work and responsibilities of home and are fully committed to the operation of family friendly policies such as flexible working hours for staff up to and including higher executive officer level, parental leave and job sharing for all grades. Any staff seeking these options to date have been accommodated. Currently 12% of female assistant principals are availing of job sharing. Work sharing or term time is being piloted in certain Departments but not in the Department of the Taoiseach. If this option is introduced we will do our utmost to accommodate staff who wish to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a policy of staff mobility in place. Staff are moved between divisions approximately every three years to broaden their experience which is essential for development and motivation. This ensures they have equal <Col N="89" /> opportunities to work in a variety of challenging areas throughout their careers.</P>
    <P>Female staff are actively encouraged to go forward for promotion and are provided with ongoing career development and support. While I am still disappointed with the level of participation of women in senior grades throughout the Civil Service, I am satisfied that my Department has attempted to address this issue with the various measures in place that I have mentioned. I look forward to the new equality policy that should be in place by the autumn. This policy is vital if we are to bring about the changes needed to achieve balanced female representation at all grades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply which complements his address to the seminar on gender equality in the Civil Service at the Institute of Public Administration on 13 June. Is the Taoiseach saying that, for as long as it remains in office, the Government is committed to redressing the imbalance outlined in the very poor figures referred to in his speech, and to which his reply in part refers where reference is made to the position in his Department? Who in the Government is to take responsibility for this? Is it a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Finance, which is effectively the personnel or HRM section of Departments, to implement the positive and progressive policies the Taoiseach has enunciated and which we support?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to recognise the constraints that are preventing many women from either returning to or staying in the workplace because of the non-family friendly working conditions which many experience? Does he recognise that the public service in general, and the Civil Service in particular, are well positioned to give a lead and are well resourced to absorb the undoubted cost that such a gender equality measure, and a working parent with young children, would require?</P>
      <P>Who has responsibility for this measure? If it is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform we can say goodbye to it. If the Department of Finance has responsibility, will it be prepared to change working conditions to make them more family friendly, especially for women? It is a sad fact of life that this should be the case but it is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In staffing and equality measures the Department of Finance has been promoting and co-ordinating the effort but, as I outlined in my reply, under the performance management and development system and the other personal development assertiveness policies, other Departments are organising their own programmes. Most Departments are using the IPA in that regard. The figures indicating that women hold 25% of assistant principal posts and 14.8% of principal officer posts refer to other <Col N="90" /> Departments. They have improved in some areas, albeit not sufficiently.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that family friendly policies are a way of assisting, especially women with families. Any schemes in this area are good, whether they relate to work sharing or term time. Departments take a favourable view on the piloting of these schemes and to encouraging people to use them in their career development. That is helping the numbers. This attitude to human resource management has helped improve the numbers and as long as it prevails they will continue to improve.</P>
      <P>Even though the figures I have indicated are a huge improvement on the position in the 1980s or early 1990s, we must continue to work on the matter until we achieve parity. At the higher levels we must ensure that success is achieved. In my Department, most people at assistant principal level have been promoted up, so it is important to address the issue at the lower grades and through all Departments. It will mean that people will move on from assistant principal and principal officer grade to assistant secretary grade and, ultimately, I hope, to the position of secretary general. There are very few at that level, although there are a number at assistant secretary level.</P>
      <P>It is important that there is a follow through and that the numbers do not decline again. The figures indicate that has happened a few times over the years. We have succeeded in achieving, if not gender balance, at least respectable figures. People are then promoted and the effort must be renewed at the lower ranks. The issue must be addressed at all grades. The figures are acceptable at EO level, but a concerted effort must be made at HEO, assistant principal and principal officer grades.</P>
      <P>Training levels are important. I have attended a number of sessions in this area under the SMI process and staff have repeatedly indicated that the necessary experience, drive and help they require in training is lacking. They need assistance and professional help to help them in the assertiveness they require when attending interviews for posts in other Departments, which can be intimidating, or within their own Departments. Traditionally, that has not been available within the public service. I hope the IPA courses will help in that regard. My Department will assist in these between autumn and Christmas. We will continue to press ahead with these arrangements to see if they are of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive supplementary reply. However, I refer to one figure he gave in the speech on 13 June. This covers a range of different Administrations and therefore I am not making a party political point. Between 1987 and 1997, there was only a 1% rise in the level of participation in the key managerial grade of assistant principle officer. Does the Taoiseach recognise that the public sector pay structure is constrained in terms of levels of remuneration which cannot be readily altered <Col N="91" /> or changed without massive knock-on effects, but the working conditions within the public sector can be dramatically changed to make that kind of employment which would be paid less than market rates in many cases outside the public service which people are currently leaving to take up those jobs? The competitive advantage the public service has is the ability to make employment much more family friendly, particularly of women of a particular age.

      <P>Absolutely. Over Howth hill into Pyongyang. The Taoiseach's speech was good and so was his reply, but has he spoken to the person responsible for implementing this policy, since he said that this has got nothing to do with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but is a matter for the Department of Finance? We will not hold the current number of women in the public service, let alone increase participation rates, unless we change working conditions since we cannot change the salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going back over what I said. The 1% increase between 1987 and 1997 at the key level of assistant principle officer was deplorable and I made that point in my speech. What we have achieved in recent years has been quite dramatic, but it is still not near what we need to achieve.</P>
      <P>There are two issues here. First, as I said, my Department is committed to providing on-going career development training for all staff. That is being promoted strongly by the management and organisation development section of the Department of Finance in all Departments. The Departments must take the lead in this. The Department of Finance is encouraging people to use the IPA to deliver a career development programme for all grades to the level of principle officer. That is of major assistance.</P>
      <P>Nowadays one loses staff if one does not try to improve the circumstances. As always, there is no point in training them and bringing them to a certain level if we cannot hold on to them. The family friendly policies being operated, such as job-sharing, are working well in many Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but with work-sharing and term-time, which is not in operation in my Department but is being piloted and which I hope will prove to be successful, the whole effort is to try to get these policies working. Where there are work-sharing arrangements and job-sharing arrangements in a number of sections in my Department, it works well. I can understand people thinking it will not work, having somebody working in the morning and somebody else in the evening or working two days one week and three the next. They might believe that such a scheme is difficult to operate, but my experience is that it works extremely well and while I have not needed to encourage my colleagues, I have been encouraging people within Departments and stating that there is nothing wrong with this. People come in, they have a job to do, they go heavily at it and then they go. I do not see anything wrong with it.</P>
      <P>I do not know a great deal about term-time, which is not operating in my Department but it is being piloted. I will certainly look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Work is continuing on the implementation of the recommendations in the Nally report on the public prosecution system, specifically the transfer of the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the State solicitor service to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in previous replies, a group comprising the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was set up to oversee the transfer. Part of the arrangements for the transfer included consideration of the staffing levels and structures necessary in the enhanced prosecution service and, in parallel, in the Chief State Solicitor's office. The process included considerable discussion between the group and the IMPACT trade union. I understand that these discussions <Col N="93" /> are complete and that proposals have been put to the union which are being considered at present.</P>
    <P>The report on human resources in the CSSO was prepared by a sub-committee of the partnership committee within the office. The issue had been included on the partnership committee agenda at the suggestion of management. The report has been circulated to all staff and the committee is now considering the implementation of the recommendations. The report contains a wide range of recommendations covering all aspects of human resource management within the office from operational matters, such as the administration of the personnel section, to recruitment, training and development issues, staff resources and accommodation. Not all are within the immediate control of the CSSO. I have arranged to have copies of the report placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty in reconciling the positive nature of the Taoiseach's reply with the reports, which I will not quote, which were carried in the newspapers as recently as the 17th of this month. This is a major and central post in the administration of the State. A period of approximately four months will have elapsed between the post becoming vacant &ndash; this is a retirement vacancy, not a sudden vacancy &ndash; and 24 August when the new man, who comes from Dublin Corporation and whom we wish well, will take up office. Is the Taoiseach aware, because it does not seem evident from this reply, that the public has serious misgivings about the inability of the Chief State Solicitor's office to do the task with which it is charged? When we previously discussed this matter on 8 February, the Taoiseach spoke of the possibility of contracting a number of people on a basis not dissimilar to the National Treasury Management Agency to give the Chief State Solicitor's office the resources it clearly lacks. Has the Taoiseach given further consideration to that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report and the document which came through the partnership process. I do not want to become involved in the arguments about that because many of them are internal. There is no doubt that there was some trenchant criticism in the document. I do not accept that all the criticism outlined in the report represents fair comment. A communication policy has been put in place recently. The partnership process involves a significant improvement in the approach to communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of overwork highlighted in the report has been the subject of union management negotiations and there is some truth in that. A substantial offer of additional staff numbers has been made to the union as part of the general package. So far, this has not been accepted but I hope that a favourable outcome will come about soon and that arrangements will be made to recruit the additional staff. They will probably be full time <Col N="94" /> but, as the Deputy said, they may also be contract staff.</P>
    <P>It is not accurate to say the recommendations of various reports were not implemented as has been highlighted. The recommendations of the main report, which was prepared by Deloitte &amp; Touche, were considered by management and, by and large, were accepted and have already been implemented. As with any such report, a number of recommendations were not acceptable to management or could not be applied at the time. That created some difficulties. The comments about leadership are not accurate. Improved management structures were put in place following the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and these have included a new divisional structure, new sectional arrangements and a new management advisory committee.</P>
    <P>While not everything in that office is perfect &ndash; I am not here to say it is &ndash; substantial progress has been made. If this round of negotiations builds on the Nally report by seeing how it can be implemented, further progress will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should correct the record. I inadvertently said the new person, Mr. David Hogan, comes from Dublin Corporation. He comes from Cork Corporation. That may be part of the reason for the delay in accepting the post. I would not like to have misled the House.</P>
      <P>Does he agree there is clearly a resource problem in this office and that this and other Governments have not been slow to contract out work for professional services such as accountancy, consultancy services for Departments and infrastructural design? When it comes to the legal sector, however, we are incapable of contracting out to the private sector for precisely the same thing. This is a Government which would gladly flog off anything which might raise a few shillings, although it has not been so successful in relation to two banks. Does the Taoiseach agree there is no ideological impediment within the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil coalition to the contracting out of legal services? If that is the case, why is this area of the public service being denied the choice of market supply available and availed of elsewhere? The State and its citizens are suffering as a result of this. There is no rational explanation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that, although I disagree with him on some things, I do not disagree with him on this. There is no ideological reason. If areas of this work have to be farmed out to contractors, I have no difficulty with that. I made that clear in these negotiations and after the publication of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland which relate to May show a year on year increase of 5.2% in the consumer price index. Inflation is 5.1% on the basis of the harmonised index of consumer prices. This compares with 1.9% for the euro-11.</P>
      <P>Inflation is now much higher than had been expected, and represents a disappointment to the Government. As Deputies are aware, there are several factors behind this, including the weakness of the euro, the upward trend in oil prices, the increase in excise duties on tobacco introduced for health reasons, higher inflation in the services sector and the ongoing increases in alcohol prices. In the coming months there will be a further uptick in inflation because of recent energy price developments and the recent increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank. As once-off and external factors become less important, however, inflation will begin to fall. The timing of this decline will depend to a large extent on exchange rate developments and the future price of oil.</P>
      <P>A new set of macro-economic forecasts, including inflation, will be published as usual by my Department in the economic review and outlook in July or August. The Government is concerned about the possible impact of these developments on social partnership and economic progress and is committed to taking whatever action is possible. As Deputies are aware, wide-ranging measures in relation to housing have already been announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promoting competition is essential in order to tackle inflation. Significant resources have been committed to the Competition Authority to enable it to tackle anti-competitive activity. The Government also believes that there is a need for specific, targeted interventions where measures to combat restrictive practices and to stimulate competition are proving difficult or are likely to take time to be effective. Measures in this regard <Col N="96" /> are being prepared and full details will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to other measures proposed to reduce inflation, I can confirm to the House that no options put forward by the ICTU in this regard have been ruled out. In particular, careful consideration will be given to proposals in the context of preparations for the next budget in December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Government consider this matter at the Cabinet meeting this morning? If so, does the Minister not feel obliged to inform the House of decisions taken in view of Question No. 12 on the Order Paper, which specifically asks the Minister what measures he intends to introduce to combat inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was indicated in the newspapers that the Government was about to consider these matters this morning, I do not feel constrained by normal Cabinet confidentiality rules. This matter was considered at the meeting and at previous meetings. Announcements on foot of decisions made by the Government will be made later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not good enough. This is the national Parliament. There is a question asking the Minister what measures he proposes to take and he is suggesting that the Government has made decisions. He has an obligation to inform the House. It is not acceptable when the Government has made a decision to deny that information to the House and to make announcements outside the House for public relations reasons. The Minister should inform the House of the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Government would have been considering a package of measures. He will also know that the Government met the ICTU last Wednesday and the IBEC later in the week. Various proposals have been put forward covering a number of areas of activity. The Government has considered the proposals and made some suggestions of its own. The measures will be announced later.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is responsible for taxation measures. There are no taxation measures in the package which will be announced nor will there be anything which comes directly within my remit. It will be the job of other Ministers to deal with those matters. The Minister for Finance deals with matters within his remit, but most of the matters referred to in the package cut across a range of Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am flabbergasted by the Minister's response. The Minister started by saying that the Government had made decisions this morning. He then suggested that he is not answerable to this House in relation to inflation. Inflation is the one issue in terms of economic management which is driving the economy off the <Col N="97" /> rails, but the Minister comes into the House and tells us he is not responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation is the most serious threat facing the State at present. The Government has come to some decisions in relation to inflation. Is the Minister refusing to inform the House what those decisions are? Is the Minister, <Col N="98" /> in avoiding Question No. 12, suggesting that he, as Minister for Finance, is bringing forward no measures whatsoever to combat inflation? Will the Minister answer Questions Nos. 10 and 11? What is the Minister's estimate for annual inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>During our last Question Time, I revised upwards the annual figure for inflation. I said in my reply then that when we publish our normal mid-year review, the Department economic review and outlook, in late July or early August we will publish the new figure, as has been the custom until now.</P>
      <P>To answer the specific question, inflation will be greater than the amount set out at the time of budget. The figures for the past months will be analysed and extrapolated forward. The new figure for inflation will be ahead of the projected budget figure &ndash; recently I predicted that it will be in excess of 4%. The picture will become clearer when the mid-year figures become available. The ESRI recently predicted that the average inflation rate for the current year will be of the order of 4.8% and that it will decrease to 3.2% in 2001. However, as stated on many occasions, our predictions and those of the ESRI and the Central Bank are subject to the usual caveats such as oil prices, exchange rates, etc.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan specifically inquired whether I agree that inflation is the major factor affecting the economy at present. It is only one of a number of such factors. One must bear in mind that Ireland's economic growth rate during the past five years has averaged 5% per annum whereas the EU average for the same period was only 2.2%. During the period in question, employment in Ireland grew by an average of 4.8% per annum whereas in other EU member states it grew by 0.8%. As stated on previous occasions, these matters must be considered in conjunction with each other. Another factor which must be taken into account is that the rate of unemployment in Ireland is now less than 5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is filibustering. I put it to him that on budget day his estimate of annual inflation was 3%, on the last occasion he replied to questions in the House he raised that estimate to 4% and he now appears to be relying on the ESRI forecast rather than on that provided by his Department. Do I take it the Minister believes inflation for this year will be not less than 4.8%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have pointed out on many occasions to the Deputy, when we are making predictions about inflation we take account of the parameters which apply at a particular point. I stated that inflation will be in excess of 4%, on average, for the year 2000. I also stated that it would increase in the middle of the year and, given the normal caveats to which I referred, should then decrease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's estimate of annual inflation? Ministers for Finance, since the foundation of the State, have been answering that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On budget day, Ministers for Finance give their estimate of inflation for the following year in light of the parameters which apply at that point. It has been normal practice for many years that in mid-year we produce our normal departmental review and revise upwards or downwards not only the figures relating to inflation but also those relating to budget surpluses, revenue and expenditure. That will also be done in the normal way this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that this is not just an academic question. There are people on fixed incomes, such as social welfare beneficiaries, who received an increase of 5% this year. The Minister has just signed off on a partnership agreement which provides for increases of approximately the same measure. If I understood his earlier reply &ndash; I stand open to correction &ndash; he stated that there would be a further uptick in inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct, that is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that means that there will be further uptick from the current rate of 5.2%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that there would be further uptick in inflation due to a number of factors, the most recent of which was the recent increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank. If that increase is passed on, it will push up the year on year increase as measured month by month. Most economists believe the best way to dampen inflation is to increase interest rates, thereby removing demand, etc., from the economy. However, when increases in interest are passed on, the consumer price index is pushed upward. We expect that, due to these factors, there will be an uptick in inflation.</P>
      <P>Last month, one of the reasons for the upward surge in inflation was the increase in food prices. This increase related primarily to the sudden rise in the price of potatoes which came about as a result of climatic conditions. No one could have predicted this development. The recent increase in interest rates by the ECB should mean that there should be a further rise in inflation next month. However, as matters begin to settle during the next 12 months and given the usual caveats, inflation should fall.</P>

      <P>I set out, on 21 June last, the position regarding the nomination and its place in the European Investment Bank procedure. I also <Col N="101" /> dealt extensively with this matter in the course of the earlier debate in the House on 23 May 2000. I will set out again the current position regarding Mr. O'Flaherty's nomination.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I formally submitted Mr. O'Flaherty's name to the bank on 18 May 2000. They will also be aware that the nomination was the subject of High Court proceedings in the interim and that the European Investment Bank was aware of the position in regard to the court action, through contacts at official level with my Department. As I said in the House last Wednesday, it is now a matter for the bank to carry through the procedures in relation to the nomination. Since then, I have written to the president of the European Investment Bank to ask him to expedite the matter.</P>
      <P>The question of a formal reaction from the bank in the nomination does not arise that this stage. The proposal has been circulated by the bank to the board of directors and, following completion of this procedure, which as I indicated previously had been interrupted by the High Court proceedings, the matter will go to the governors who make the appointment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the McDowell implementation advisory group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority &ndash; SRA &ndash; for the financial services sector was published in June 1999. Discussions have taken place between officials of both my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The matter is being jointly considered by the Tánaiste and me. When our proposals in this regard have been finalised, our joint proposals will be submitted to Government for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government has had over a year to consider the McDowell report which strongly recommended the establishment of a new greenfield regulator that would combine the roles of the Central Bank and a beefed-up consumer regulator, why has this clear recommendation not been implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on a number of occasions that it has not been easy to reach a consensus on this matter. The Government decided to set up a single regulator and Mr. McDowell was asked to chair an implementation group to consider how that might be done. Nine eminent people were appointed to the implementation group and the majority of them came up with the idea of a greenfield site. Two members thought the regulator should be established as an in-house division of the Central Bank and a third person came up with the idea of a separate pillar or twin pillars approach. Therefore, I received three distinct proposals from the nine eminent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was being considered outside the House, the Fine Gael Party spokesperson expressed the view that the party would favour the approach advanced by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, namely, the establishment of an in-house division within the Central Bank. As far as I am aware, the Labour Party view, expressed by Deputy McDowell, favours the majority view. Deputy Deenihan will appreciate that we do not have unanimity on this matter and that, having received various views from <Col N="103" /> bank representatives, financial analysts and Mr. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, I have been overwhelmed with all manner of advice. It is a pity most of that advice is conflicting.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy to arrive at an appropriate way in which to proceed with this matter. The Tánaiste and I, together with officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are doing everything in our power to arrive at the best solution. This is a very important matter and, as the Leader of the Fine Gael Party stated, it is vitally important that we get it right. This is not something we can simply take a chance with. One can make certain decisions which, although they might be politically earth shattering, will not do everlasting damage to the country's finances. We will make every effort to obtain agreement on this matter but it has not been possible to achieve that to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the comments expressed today in a national newspaper report by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. O'Connell, to the effect that the uncertainty which is being created is leading to a loss of staff and creating difficulties in recruiting staff? Is the Minister concerned about these comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I meet the Governor of the Central Bank quite regularly and although I have not read the newspaper report, I am aware from those meetings of Mr. O'Connell's views on this matter. Mr. O'Connell has conveyed the message to me directly on a number of occasions that the future uncertainty of regulation presents difficulties in regard to recruiting and retaining staff and I will certainly bear that in mind in trying to reach a decision. However, as I pointed out, it has not been easy to arrive at an agreed solution and it is vital that we arrive at the correct solution.</P>
      <P>In spite of all the revelations made in recent years and in spite of the strong criticisms made of the Central Bank inside and outside this House, it must be recognised that, internationally, the Central Bank has an unbelievably good reputation. Foreign financial institutions which set up in this country and those which deal with Ireland go out of their way to praise the Central Bank. They do not praise the bank because they feel they are expected to do so, rather they compare it with the treatment they receive in other countries. Our Central Bank has a very high international reputation and we do not want to lose that whatever happens. It has taken a long time to build up that reputation and we cannot just throw it away as it would be very difficult to get it back. Most responsible people in this House and outside it are cognisant of that fact. There is no unanimity between the parties in this House as to how we should proceed, nor was it possible to achieve such unanimity among the nine members of the expert group.</P>

Can the Minister tell us when the authority will be set up?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the claims made by the information officer of the Association of Inspector of Taxes that the Revenue Commissioners were concentrating on small and medium-sized businesses and neglecting large corporations where there is much evasion; his views on the opinion expressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18163/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments in question. I have consulted the Revenue Commissioners who have assured me that the opinion expressed is quite incorrect and that large cases are receiving appropriate audit attention relative to the risks involved. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that it is essential to have an audit presence in each segment of the tax paying population and the Revenue audit programme aims to strike the correct balance between the audit of large companies which, although small in overall numbers, pay the largest proportion of tax, and the audit of small and medium-sized businesses which, although significant in overall numbers, pay a relatively low proportion of overall tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very different considerations apply to large companies as against medium and small-sized businesses. The nature of the tax risks differ in the different sized companies. Different audit approaches are, therefore, taken by Revenue to reflect these underlying differences. Under the audit programme, the tax records of the largest 2,000 cases are reviewed each year whereas this would not be the case with small and medium-sized businesses. In 1999, 475 audits were carried out on some aspect of these large cases and this is a much higher proportion than that for smaller cases. Moreover, an internal Revenue analysis of <Col N="105" /> the top 20 non-financial large corporates shows that audit activity was carried out in every case in the two year period 1998 and 1999. Proportionately more taxpayers with a turnover exceeding £1 million are audited.</P>
    <P>I understand that Revenue also devotes significant effort to tackling tax avoidance which can be a feature of larger enterprises and high worth individuals. Revenue's attention to large cases is also evidenced by its tax recoveries from large cases. The details of many of these recoveries are not publishable because the cases do not meet the strict criteria for publication. Nevertheless, it is important that the public would have information about the size of recoveries from large cases.</P>
    <P>For the top 30 cases settled by Revenue in 1999, there was a total yield of £25 million, that is an average of more than £800,000 per case. However, only three cases were published and these settlements ranged from £328,000 to £622,000. Details of the other 27 cases were not publishable but their settlements ranged from £338,000 to £3,500,000. In 1999 there were 146 cases of audit settlements for over £100,000 but details of only 32 of them were publishable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>.</P>
    <P>I would also mention specific measures taken in relation to large cases. Three professional accountants were recruited on contract in 1999 and two more will be recruited in 2000 which will further strengthen the effectiveness of the large companies audits. A working group consisting of experienced Revenue audit managers and auditors is currently examining the approach in large cases to consider what changes, if any, are appropriate to improve risk identification and auditing procedures.</P>
    <P>There was an interim addition to staff in the audit and investigation area in 1999 with the appointment of ten higher grade inspectors, that is assistant principal officer level. I have recently approved the Revenue Commissioners' request for additional staff, 155 of whom I understand are intended for the audit and investigation area. This will substantially increase Revenue capacity to audit more large cases while coping with the temporary increase in work arising from the DIRT, Ansbacher and other investigations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the details are not publishable because the settlements were arrived at by agreement and with the co-operation of the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the reasons the details of individual cases are not publishable. The Deputy will be aware from our debates on the Finance Bill that a range of criteria must be met before details of a case are not published. I am sure it satisfied those criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have sufficient staff to do this work?

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

I deal with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and I have acceded to any propositions put to me regarding extra staff. The Deputy can check the record if he wishes. It is the function of the Chairman and the other commissioners to manage their resources effectively and, as management must do, make decisions based on that. I have acceded to any requests for extra staff made to me by the Revenue Commissioners. Not only have I given the figures in the House but the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners gave them during his deliberations at the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

I saw reports of somewhat testy exchanges between the union representative and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. However, the Deputy should remember that it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Finance to become involved in staff matters relating to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

It is up to the Revenue to get on with the job of filling those vacancies and of managing. It is not my role to manage the resources of the Revenue Commissioners. However, I am satisfied that it does an excellent job, as I have said on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in its special EU programmes sectoral format held in Dublin on 16 June. This meeting was also the first North-South Minis<Col N="107" /> terial Council meeting since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. Mr. Mark Durkan, Minister of Finance and Personnel, and Mr. Sam Foster, Minister of the Environment, Northern Ireland, attended together with officials of our respective Departments, the North-South Ministerial Council Secretariat and the Special EU Programmes Body. The meeting was most successful and it specifically agreed the arrangements for North-South co-operation on EU-funded programmes as envisaged under Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>Among the issues which were considered was progress to date in taking forward the work of the Special EU Programmes Body. An oral report on this was given by the interim chief executive officer of the body. The council endorsed proposals for taking forward the work of the body. It also endorsed proposals for its initial staffing structure and procedures for appointing a permanent chief executive officer. The body will have its headquarters in Belfast with regional offices in Monaghan and Omagh.</P>
      <P>The Special EU Programmes Body, as the managing authority, will have a significant role in the negotiation, monitoring and management of the PEACE programme, INTERREG community initiative and other community initiatives, all of which were co-funded by the European Union. The body will have a crucial role to play in ensuring that these programmes are delivered effectively and efficiently. The PEACE and INTERREG programmes in the 1994-99 period made an important contribution to reconciliation, cross-Border co-operation and regional and community development on both sides of the Border. The new PEACE II programme and INTERREG III community initiative should build on this foundation in the more peaceful and stable environment that now prevails in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. These two programmes alone will account for some 900 million of EU and public matching funds.</P>
      <P>The council also approved a common text on North-South co-operation for inclusion in the Ireland and Northern Ireland community support frameworks. A minimum indicative 400 million has been earmarked for projects in this area. I stress that this is a minimum figure and it is my expectation that the actual level of investment in North-South projects over the period to 2006 will be significantly higher. The Special EU Programmes Body will have responsibility for monitoring progress in this regard and it will, therefore, have a major role in promoting North-South co-operation.</P>
      <P>Finally, we agreed that we would meet on a quarterly basis in this sectoral format, with the next meeting taking place in October in Northern Ireland.</P>

It is envisaged that in time it will have its own chief executive, recruited by way of open competition in the coming months. Staff recruited to the body will be its staff. It will be able to give grants but it will be subject to the agreement of the two Departments. It must be remembered that the body is a transfer of power from our side of the Border and the Northern Ireland side by the two Governments. Most of these bodies are quite unusual in that they have been arrived at following long negotiation. Everything is intended to be done as a transfer of powers from the relevant Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17, 62 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The statement to which the Deputies refer was made by the President of the European Central Bank to the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. He said that the Irish inflation situation was &ldquo;worrisome&rdquo;. These comments reflect the concerns already expressed in the annual ECOFIN Council Opinion on Ireland's stability programme and, second, in the country specific recommendations contained in the annual broad economic policy guidelines.</P>
      <P>As I stated previously, the Government is disappointed by the recent increase in inflation. We are concerned and, in that respect, we share the concerns expressed by others including the social partners. The Government is taking steps to reduce inflation. As the House is aware, the Government recently approved a further package of measures in relation to the housing market. These measures seek to increase the supply of housing and to make it more affordable for first-time buyers. In particular, the Government sought to strengthen the position of first-time buyers in the market and to curb speculative demand for housing.</P>
      <P>As I stated previously, promoting competition is essential in order to tackle inflation. Significant resources have also been committed to the Competition Authority to enable it to tackle anti-competitive activity and profiteering in sheltered sectors of the economy. Other measures are being prepared and will be announced shortly. Deputies will be aware that the European Central Bank President also praised our economic performance in his recent comments. He noted the recent economic transformation of the Irish economy and, in particular, the fact that we have moved from a country of net emigration to one of net immigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the President's conclusion that it is up to the Government to deal with inflation and that the European Central Bank can do very little to assist it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the comments of the President he will see he was very complimentary regarding the Irish economic performance in recent years. He said: </P>
      <P>There is nothing the ECB can do about it except try to convince the national authorities in Ireland that these developments which are indeed somewhat worrisome are their piece of cake. Ireland does not have a balance of payments any more. Europe has a balance of payments, so the  policeman you could say is on vacation. It is a very difficult situation to handle but on the other hand I am always struck by the   developments   Ireland   has   gone</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> through. Through centuries Ireland was a country with net emigration, now it has net immigration which is an achievement of historic proportions not to be underestimated.</P>
    <P>As President Duisenberg has summed it up on a number of occasions, there are matters both inside and outside our control. It is important, as more rational comment in the last week or so has emphasised, to address those matters within our control we can do something about, while those outside our control we can do nothing about. We can do nothing about the price of oil or the strength of the euro, but we should do something about internal matters. As I have said in previous replies, the best way to combat inflation is through competition and most rational commentators agree with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Duisenberg specifically mentioned that the Government should consider reducing indirect taxes. Can we take it from what the Minister said earlier that he has rejected any possibility of reducing excise duty or the rate of VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that as a result of the meeting with the social partners these matters were considered and he will also be aware of comments I have made in this regard. These matters will be considered further before the budget. The Deputy will agree that there are upsides and downsides to tinkering with certain measures, though there is no universal agreement on that. If one had four economists in this room one would get four different opinions on the matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that as of now there are no proposals for change in that regard. As I have said on previous occasions and in interviews, all taxation matters are considered coming up to each budget &ndash; matters related to VAT, excise and direct taxation &ndash; and that will be the situation this year also. As I have also said, there is considerable disagreement among all experts in these areas.</P>

      <Quest>if he has issued instructions to, and-or received communications from, the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the 1994 regulations in respect of disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions); if the current review group studying this matter has reported; if many submissions have been received in connection with the said regulations; if all such submissions have been acknowledged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms and conditions governing the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme are set out in Statutory Instrument No 353 of 1994, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The Deputy is no doubt aware that the scheme is operated on a day to day basis by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department has no involvement in its administration. I have issued no instructions to the Revenue Commissioners in connection with these 1994 regulations. As I have previously informed the House, the Revenue Commissioners completed a technical review of the scheme which has a very specific focus in that it aims to address only the technical and operational problems with the present scheme, with a view to making the scheme operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners report was sent to the interdepartmental review group, which has yet to report. It is chaired by an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="112" /> which provides the secretariat for the group and which would also be responsible for receipt and acknowledgement of submissions.</P>
    <P>Meetings were held with various interest groups and individuals who had expressed views over a three day period in early May. An advertisement was also placed in the press on 11 May 2000 seeking written submissions from interested parties. The closing date for receipt of those submissions was 26 May 2000 and I understand that as of 22 June 2000, 239 written submissions have been received by the group in response to the advertisement. I also understand a letter of acknowledgement was issued to each of the 239 persons and groups who made submissions. The group in its deliberations is also informed by the submissions which it received from members of the public and from public representatives prior to 11 May 2000 and is, of course, also aware of points raised in Dáil and Seanad debates on this subject.</P>
    <P>While I have no definite date for completion of the report, I hope the receipt of the submissions will facilitate the group in its deliberations and in early finalisation. The report will be submitted to my Department for consideration and a decision to publish will be made at that stage. I do not consider it prudent to make further comment on the scheme pending receipt of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but he said all submissions were acknowledged and I know they have not. What precisely are the terms of reference of the review group? It appears from previous experience that this group is sitting for an inordinately long time. The Minister should indicate how much longer the group intends to sit before coming up with an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must contact the secretariat in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because it is responsible for acknowledging submissions. My reply states that the submissions have been acknowledged, but I will check that for the Deputy. I do not have the terms of reference in my supplementary notes, but I can send them to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I agree the group has been sitting for some time, but we have not had a review of this for some time and it is important when doing so to take all representations and opinions into account. The Deputy will also be aware that an analysis of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Finance would show that matters relating to the disabled drivers' and passengers' scheme is one of the top two queries. It has been the subject of various parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates and I regularly receive letters about it. I, too, would like the group to conclude its deliberations. I am sure that will be done in the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take the initiative to bring matters to a conclusion, given that he and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, <Col N="113" /> Equality and Law Reform, answered parliamentary questions on this issue in 1998? It appears that at this stage a directive should be issued to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion, having particular regard to the ever increasing numbers of disabled people, passengers or potential drivers, who cannot access education or employment as long as this group remains as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had lengthy discussions on this matter when dealing with parliamentary questions and on a number of occasions during debates on the Finance Bill. It is a very generous scheme, but if we extended it to everyone with a disability it would be very costly. It is very invidious to start differentiating between disabilities and the issue is very complex. The officials are working as efficiently as they can and we hope to have the report shortly. If we were starting off I am sure we would have come up with a different scheme, but people have had difficulties when trying to tinker with the existing scheme due to its generous terms. This group has been considering the matter and I am sure it will report soon.</P>

I could explain those amendments clearly to the Minister and they would satisfy a large number of people. Will he consider this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked that question before and I cannot because any small change would bring demands for more changes. That is one of the reasons we have set up this review group &ndash; to examine this in a composite way. I see some anomalies but making little changes here and there would lead to further difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that DIRT returns for the 13 tax years from 1986-87 to 1998-99, inclusive, are being audited using the powers made available by the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the audit programme is to enable Revenue to compute the amount of tax underpaid, if any, by each deposit-taker together with the interest and penalties due. The focus of Revenue's DIRT look-back audits is on checking a sample of non-resident accounts, as provided for in the legislation, in each of the financial institutions concerned. The information gathered from checking the sample of non-resident <Col N="114" /> accounts, together with the other information obtained by inspectors in the course of their audits, will allow Revenue form a view on compliance with the DIRT legislation in each institution and, where necessary, an estimation of the level, if any, of DIRT under-deducted by the financial institution.</P>
    <P>Revenue has assigned 37 officers to work on a full-time basis on the project. In addition to the officers working full-time on the project, 30 inspectors from districts outside Dublin have been assigned for short periods, two to four weeks each, to assist in the audits.</P>
    <P>Revenue has set itself the target of completing the computations of tax, interest and penalties by summer 2000. I am informed by Revenue that, overall, the project is on schedule but that a considerable amount of work still remains to be done. A generally high level of co-operation is being received from the financial institutions. If the DIRT arrears, interest and penalties due cannot be agreed in discussion with the deposit-taker, assessments will be raised on the deposit-taker by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in section 68 of this year's Finance Act for the Revenue Commissioners to publish the results, including interim results, of their look-back DIRT audits, covering the years 1986-87 to 1998-99. Revenue is required to make a report to the Committee of Public Accounts before 1 November 2000. The Deputy will be aware that the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, which conducted the DIRT inquiry, carried out a full review of the progress made in implementing all its recommendations, including those in relation to the look-back audits, at the hearings on 20 June 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions. At the initial stages of the inquiry, I asked representatives from the main financial institutions if they accepted they had broken the law. They admitted they had, and that is on the record. In other words, their organisations defrauded the State of many millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department told publicans that if they did not pay their taxes, they would not get licences and that was very successful. Given that these representatives freely admitted they defrauded the State, will the Minister consider refusing to re-license financial institutions on the basis that they have not yet paid the money of which they defrauded the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts made a variety of recommendations as to what should be done. I have given replies in the Dáil on the progress made in my Department. The sub-committee met the Revenue Commissioners and others last week to see how its recommendations were progressing. I do not <Col N="115" /> recall a recommendation from the Committee of Public Accounts along the lines the Deputy is now suggesting. Perhaps I can take it he did not put that suggestion to the Committee of Public Accounts, or maybe he is about to do so. He could take it up with the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a further question because the Minister has not answered me. In replies to questions asked by me, it was admitted that these financial institutions were effectively breaking the law, and that is on the record. Will the Minister introduce the necessary regulations or refuse to re-license these financial institutions until they pay the money of which they defrauded the State? If we were talking about a PAYE worker, there would be no doubt about that. Will the Minister, who is normally very frank and honest, initiate proceedings against these financial institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to provide an interim report and a final report as to the amount of the assessments that will be raised. I understand they hope to complete their work this month. They will then enter into negotiations and if they cannot get agreement on the amount of money which has been underpaid by the financial institutions in respect of DIRT, they will raise assessments. If the assessments are challenged, it will have to go through the normal procedures and we will have to take it from there. I envisage that we will collect a lot of money from the financial institutions arising from the look-back audit from 1986-87 to 1998-99. Any further matters can be considered then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the financial institutions are well advanced in estimating the amount of DIRT they owe to the Revenue Commissioners. Is it the policy of the Government that the Revenue Commissioners will pursue individual depositors to recover outstanding tax rather than just pursing the institutions which have liabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioner have not yet completed their work on the financial institutions. As I said in reply to Deputy Bell, when they do that, they will compute the liabilities due. If they are all agreed, they will be paid. I am sure further matters will then be considered by the Revenue Commissioners. Deputy Noonan asked what will be the position on the underlying deposits in the institutions when this is all over &ndash; hopefully, by the end of this year &ndash; and the financial institutions have paid up or the matter has progressed. That is an operational matter which the Revenue Commissioners would then have to consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan would want to be very careful. The evasion of tax by any person is an offence and it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to pursue taxpayers if they have not paid their taxes. At present the deliberations are with the financial institutions as to their liability because they did not deduct DIRT properly. When the Revenue Commissioners are finished with the financial institutions and receive the correct amounts of money which they owe to the State, it will then be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to look, if they have sufficient information, at the underlying individual deposit holders if they consider an individual deposit holder is in breach of the law regarding his or her tax liabilities. That is the position that applies to the Deputy, to me and to everybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is certainly not neutral on the issue. The laws on taxation are passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to collect those taxes without fear or favour, not only from institutions, but also from individuals. The financial institutions, which have been evading their responsibilities, must pay DIRT, together with interest and penalties, and that will be agreed with the Revenue Commissioners. If individuals evaded their responsibilities, they too will suffer the full rigours of the tax law.</P>

    <P Just="Center">In compliance with Standing Order 160 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, I have to announce that at the By-Election held on 22nd June, 2000, consequent on the death of Deputy Michael Ferris, the following member has been elected to the Dáil:&ndash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Healy to the Dáil and congratulate him, his family and his election workers on his election in the Tipperary South by-election. The Deputy will feel he has served a long political apprenticeship as a public representative in Clonmel. He was first elected to Clonmel Corporation 15 years ago and to Tipperary South Riding County Council in 1991. He has received a strong mandate to represent the people of Tipperary South in the House and on behalf of the Government I assure him that the concerns of those people are close to our hearts and we will continue the ambitious programme of investment in that constituency.</P>
      <P>One's first day in the Dáil is always an important day which one remembers whatever happens. It is always a special day to come to the House with one's family and supporters. I wish Deputy Healy every success and congratulate him on his achievement. He has every right to feel very satisfied personally and I congratulate his workers on the job they have done.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention the Fianna Fáil candidate, Barry O'Brien. He was an excellent candidate who worked extremely hard to achieve the nomination and during the campaign. He, his family and workers will naturally be very disappointed having waged a strong campaign but he has a good future in politics and I wish him well. However, today is a day for Deputy Healy and I welcome him to the House and congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a magnificent achievement by Deputy Healy. It is almost without precedent in political terms for an Independent to win a seat in this fashion. It is important to point out that this is not an overnight achievement but is the result of a long period of hard work by Deputy Healy on behalf of his constituents. It was plain to all who visited the homes of Tipperary that he is held in the highest esteem and I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say a word of consolation to the unsuccessful candidates. I commend particularly Fine Gael's candidate, Senator Tom Hayes, on the magnificent campaign he fought and the magnificent result achieved by the party. This would not have been possible without the unstinting <Col N="119" /> support of Deputy Theresa Ahearn who stood beside the Fine Gael candidate, something which is very difficult for a sitting Deputy to do.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that this day of happiness for Deputy Healy has occurred because of an event of great sadness, namely the death of Michael Ferris. No one will feel this loss more deeply than his widow, Ellen, and it was particularly hard for her to bear the events of the past number of weeks. She is a woman of great talent and ability and I have no doubt her party, which supported her loyally, will find a way to ensure her talents are used to the full in the public interest. We should not forget her on this important occasion.</P>
    <P>While I will have occasion to criticise Fianna Fáil, I have nothing but praise for its candidate in Tipperary South. He is a decent man who carried out a very difficult job with dignity. That was particularly evident at the count and I commend him and his wife for upholding the best traditions of their party in adversity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I heartily congratulate Deputy Healy on his spectacular victory. His election will have surprised even himself and his many friends and supporters, many of whom are in the Gallery. This is a wonderful day for the Healy family, for the Deputy's wife and children and for all those who worked so hard for this success.</P>
      <P>A great Irishman from a neighbouring county, Val Doonican, once replied to a BBC chatshow host's well-informed comment about him being an overnight success that he was an overnight success after 20 years. The same could be said of Deputy Healy who has spent a long time seeking electoral office and first won local electoral office in the 1980s. For most of us, winning the support and trust of the electorate requires years of dedicated work and the Deputy has demonstrated such commitment. However, the Deputy should not get too comfortable, not because he is occupying a Labour Party seat, but because we may all be knocking on doors very soon. The Taoiseach should not dare look behind him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy John Bruton's remarks. While the Labour Party lost the seat it had a wonderful candidate in Ellen Ferris. Labour Party members from within and without the constituency who travelled to Tipperary South, or the <Col N="120" />&ldquo;Costa del Suir&rdquo; as I described it because of the wonderful weather during the campaign, were very proud of the campaign conducted by Ellen Ferris and the manner in which she was received across the county. The Labour Party will return to Tipperary South at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa chomh maith comhghairdeas a ghabháil thar ceann an Chomhaontas Glas leis an tUasal Séamus Healy, Teachta Dála, agus a rá go bhfuil fáilte 's fiche roimhe anseo mar dhuine neamspleách ag a bhfuil tacaíocht láidir óna dháilcheantar.</P>
      <P>Our thoughts are also with Ellen Ferris and the other candidates who have to accept the decision, as difficult as that is, and all the circumstances which brought about the by-election which are fresh in their minds every day.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that Deputy Healy's election was exceptional and outstanding. However, it will not be all that unusual in light of the public's feelings. People are tired of the traditional political establishment and are baying for an election. Many would concur with Deputy Healy's message that an election is overdue. I agree with that sentiment and, notwithstanding that message, I wish him long years of active involvement in Dáil Éireann, whether in this or the next Dáil.</P>

      <P>I join with the warm, genuine and sincere words of welcome for Deputy Healy on his election in Tipperary South. Seeing the Deputy in the House brings back happy memories for all Members of the day we were first elected. No one should forget the privilege bestowed on us by the electorate in voting for us and electing us as their representative in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Healy and I have been colleagues on Tipperary South Riding County Council and Clonmel Corporation, on which we disagreed on many issues. However, we have the good of the people in south Tipperary in common. I know Deputy Healy, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and I will work together for the benefit of south Tipperary. We hope our constituency, which was in the limelight during the by-election campaign, will be the real benefactor. This is a great and well-deserved day for Deputy Healy, his wife Mary and his wonderful team of workers who are an example to all of us. Those Members who have visited south Tipperary have seen how we conduct our political lives. We are rivals but we conduct our business in an honourable fashion. Perhaps if politics in the rest of the country was conducted in the same manner as in south Tipperary, there would be little need for tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish Deputy Healy a successful time in this House. I hope he will not have a rushed tour and he will be given some time to get used to the proceedings. While the people of south Tipperary have returned an Independent, they will always <Col N="121" /> think it best that there should be a woman on the team.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa freisin fáilte a chur roimh an Teachta Healy agus comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis. On my behalf and I am sure on behalf of my fellow Independents, I congratulate and welcome the newest Independent Member, Deputy Healy, to Dáil Éireann. I was delighted to see the people of south Tipperary, like the people of Dublin central nearly 20 years ago, elect an independent people's representative. I wish him well and hope he will be here for many years and many elections to come.</P>

I extend congratulations on my own behalf and that of my party, Sinn Féin, throughout this country, to the newly elected Deputy for Tipperary South, Deputy Healy. For a member of a smaller party or an Independent to be successful in a general election is a significant achievement but for a representative of a smaller party or an Independent to win a by-election is a phenomenal achievement. Special congratulations must be extended to Deputy Healy on the many years of effort he has invested in forging this great success which is a deserved result after the many years of hard work he and his able team have expended in giving service at local level to the people of south Tipperary. I have no doubt the same energy, enthusiasm and determination will echo in this House in Deputy Healy's term. I hope he will be here for many terms to come as he has undoubtedly already proven himself to be an able and worthy representative of his people.</P>

        <b>:</b> On behalf of the Socialist Party, I congratulate Deputy Healy and commend the members of the Tipperary Workers and Unemployed Group. The result they have achieved is of enormous significance and cannot be under estimated. I hope the Government and the political establishment realise the depth of anger among ordinary people about the cronyism and sleaze in the establishment and the betrayal of the majority of ordinary people which is so evident. In electing a representative of working and unemployed people, who is in nobody's pocket, the people of south Tipperary are giving a lead to the people who will follow their lead at the earliest possible opportunity. I hope they have that opportunity without delay.</P>

      <P>No. It is clear that anyone who is in any way critical of the direction in which the European Union is heading has been excluded from the debate. The Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party tabled questions on the matter only to be told that it would be dealt with. We were even told that defence matters would not be raised in Portugal, but they were. We now find that we have been excluded from this important debate. That is undemocratic, it amounts to censorship and is unacceptable.</P>

        <b>:</b> I tabled a question to the Taoiseach for oral reply today about his dealings with the British Government regarding Northern Ireland, but it was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle because it would anticipate statements scheduled for today on the European Council meeting held in Feira. Inexplicable though that decision might be, I now find that 70 minutes have been set aside for the debate and that the Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have stitched it up between themselves, each of which will have 20 minutes, with ten minutes for the reply. It will not be possible for small parties or Independents such as myself to contribute. Unless this is changed, I will oppose the proposal most strenuously.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree to the Order of Business as presented. I tabled two questions to the Taoiseach for oral answer today on the European Council summit in Portugal, but they were disallowed on the basis that they would anticipate statements on the summit. The same happened following the Helsinki summit. The record will show that the Taoiseach indicated at that time that the questions should not have been disallowed. Yet, it has been repeated today. Independent representatives and I as a representative of a smaller party are routinely excluded from statements. It is imperative that the Taoiseach put into action the sentiments he has expressed, that it is patently unfair that our questions are disallowed on the one hand and that we are censored in terms of participation in statements on the other, in this case statements on the Portuguese summit. This is completely unacceptable. I ask all opinion, not just Independents and members of small parties, to join with us in opposition to the Order of Business unless the Taoiseach indicates that the matter will be revisited and that time will be accorded to Independent Members and members of small parties during the course of statements on the summit.</P>

      <P>In view of the way matters on the Order of Business have proceeded, if the House <Col N="130" /> takes a full 70 minutes to debate No. 44, it will only have a very short time to consider Second Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill by 7 p.m. It will not be possible for either of the Opposition speakers to make a contribution or for the Minister to conclude, unless his opening statement is his conclusion. I suggest to the Taoiseach that the Whips modify that order. I do not seek an extension of the sitting beyond 10.30 p.m. but it is unnecessarily rigid to order the conclusion of Second Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill by 7 p.m.</P>

Twenty minutes would be a luxury to the smaller parties.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any proposals for dealing with outstanding legislation? I hope it might restore some confidence in the political process. The Criminal Justice (Protection of Confidential Information) Bill is one such. Given the news relating to Fianna Fáil today, will this Bill be published? Has a precedent been set in terms of the length of time it takes between the publication of a Bill and its enactment? The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is now one year in abeyance at a time when there is increasing destruction of the natural environment. It will not now be enacted before the recess.</P>

Will this legislation be in place shortly in order to prevent the outrageous <Col N="133" /> situation where companies which deny the right of workers to be represented by a trade union are establishing in Dublin and elsewhere?</P>

    <Title>European Summit: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council in Feira in Portugal on 19 and 20 of June 2000, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The Feira Summit, the second of the Portuguese Presidency, sought to build on the positive outcomes from the Lisbon Summit of March last while developing the agenda for the French and subsequent Presidencies. Although the Presidency itself described the summit as a stock taking exercise, it was no less valuable for that, given the complexity of the issues with which it was dealing. The summit took place against the background of the tragedy at Dover <Col N="141" /> and I want to comment on that tragedy in the course of my statement.</P>
      <P>The Council began on the morning of Monday, 19 June with the traditional address by the President of the European Parliament, Madam Nicole Fontaine, and was subsequently addressed by Mr. Ignacio Mendez de Vigo, vice-chair of the convention entrusted with the drawing up of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights. Mr. de Vigo's attendance was in place of Mr. Roman Herzog, the former German President, who had previously chaired the convention but who owing to the sad death of his wife was unable to attend the Council.</P>
      <P>The remainder of Monday morning focused essentially on a range of economic and fiscal issues while the working lunch was taken up with the Intergovernmental Conference and the Presidency's report on the negotiations to date.</P>
      <P>The afternoon session focused on enlargement, European security and defence and a range of external relations topics including Russia, western Balkans, the Middle East peace process and regional issues in Africa. Regarding the last item, EU Leaders were addressed by President Mbeki of South Africa. The President also attended the informal dinner hosted on Monday evening by the Portuguese President, Mr. Sampaio.</P>
      <P>The Tuesday morning session of the Council focused exclusively on agreeing the Council conclusions. I want to record also that there were both formal and informal meetings of the General Affairs Council and ECOFIN in the margins of the summit.</P>
      <P>I now want to take the opportunity to outline some of the principal outcomes from an Irish point of view but should mention also that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his concluding statement, will address the main external relations matters which were discussed in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Taoiseach is again suggesting that the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the end of the debate will deal with some matters. This means, in effect, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will not be able to deal with issues raised by other speakers because he will have a prepared speech.</P>
      <P>There is no point having a debate here unless points made by Deputy Quinn and me may be responded to in some capacity by the Government. We protested about this on the last occasion and it seems to have fell on deaf ears. This is a debating Chamber. It is not a place where people simply read out prepared speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though Deputy Bruton declined and refused to do anything about that for many years when we asked him to do so, when it was raised here by him and Deputy Quinn on the last occasion we did look at it and there is merit in it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will endeavour at the end to do reply in as much as he can but in many cases that is not possible on the short notice, but we have been looking at providing for where we could <Col N="142" /> have a more meaningful debate at the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the work of the Councils, and are prepared to agree to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But neither the Taoiseach, Deputy Quinn nor I are members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that he resisted for years, we will now try to make it more meaningful. I accepted that before, and I think we can make more meaningful at the Committee on Foreign Affairs issues which would be more relevant to that.</P>
      <P>Together with other parties, I was pleased that the Portuguese Presidency invited a representative of the convention charged with drawing up the draft charter to attend the summit and to report on the progress made to date. Deputies will recall that the charter was first commissioned at the Cologne Summit in June 1999, and that the convention is comprised of representatives of the 15 Heads of State or Government, of the 15 national parliaments, and of the European Parliament, together with a range of observers.</P>
      <P>It was clear from our discussions that a majority of member states wish that the charter would remain a political declaration. Clearly, a legally binding document - such that it could adequately cover the very diverse range of issues which have been raised by the convention to date - could not be drafted in the time available. Any legal document would have to meet in a suitable manner the legal and constitutional requirements of each of the 15 member states, and this would obviously require a much more fundamental and extensive exercise.</P>
      <P>EU Leaders took the opportunity of commending the convention for the work which had been done to date, and decided that a final draft of the charter should be prepared in advance of the European Council which is to be held in Biarritz in October of this year.</P>
      <P>Staying with institutional issues, I expressed strong satisfaction with the report produced by the Presidency in relation to the intergovernmental conference. I warmly welcomed the report, as it sets out clearly the main options which can be further pursued during the course of the French Presidency and helpfully indicates areas where possible solutions may lie. There is increasing acceptance, which we share, as to the need to retain one Commissioner per member state. This is an essential link between member states and the Brussels based institutions of the Union. We will continue to argue strongly that nothing should be done to weaken this link especially at a time when the Governments of each of the member states are seeking to bring the Union closer to its people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will also addressed other topics, including the extension of qualified majority voting; the re-weighting of votes in Council; the allocation of seats in the European Parliament; and the reorganisation of <Col N="143" /> the European Court of Justice; the Court of First Instance; the European Court of Auditors; the Economic and Social Committee; and the Committee of the Regions.</P>
    <P>Together with my EU colleagues, I stressed the importance of ensuring that the work of the conference can be successfully concluded at the Nice Summit in December. A successful conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference is essential if the Union is to ready itself by end 2002 for the accession of new members. Of course, adequate time must be allowed for national ratification processes to be completed. As to the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, the topic of flexibility or enhanced co-operation has been included. It has been obvious for some time that this issue would be formally placed on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda and we remain ready to consider any proposals in this area, both as regards making the current provisions more effective or extending their scope to new areas. However, it has to be said that those proposing change in this regard have not as yet clarified their objectives, and the substance of what might be involved would need to be examined very carefully.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the summit, I spoke to the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Gutteres, and his office subsequently kept my Department fully informed of the attitudes among the EU 14 regarding bilateral relations with Austria. I also spoke to Chancellor Schüssel in the week before the summit. As Deputies will be aware, we have been among those countries which have sought to achieve progress in this matter. We believe, like others, that it is time to move forward. However, as consensus did not emerge from the 14 in advance of the summit, this was not possible. The bilateral measures do not fall within the Union's competence and so were not an item on our agenda. However, as is widely known, the matter was raised by Chancellor Schüssel, and the Prime Minister, Mr. Gutteres, indicated that he hoped a revised position would be adopted by the 14 in the near future. Ireland would certainly support such a move.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the Presidency's wide-ranging draft progress report on the follow-up to the Helsinki conclusions and mandated further work to be conducted during the French Presidency. The report and its four annexes, from an Irish point of view, represent a balanced outcome acceptable to us and to other neutral and non-allied EU members. The report focuses on military and civil aspects of crisis management and, importantly, incorporates references to the role of the UN and the importance of the EU co-operating with the UN and other relevant security organisations in both military and civil fields.</P>
    <P>As regards military aspects, the report records progress on the elaboration of the so-called headline goal target whereby the EU wishes to be in a position by 2003 to field a force of some 60,000 <Col N="144" /> personnel. Such a force would be the equivalent to that operating in Kosovo at present. I welcome this ongoing progress, including the decision to hold a capabilities commitment conference later this year where member states will make initial national commitments. We have a proud history of peacekeeping and current developments are in keeping with our practices in this area.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of capabilities, the Helsinki conclusions called for progress in relation to our decision making structures. The report submitted to the Feira summit noted the progress to date in the establishment of the interim political and security committee and the interim military committee. At Feira, EU leaders called for an overall report to be presented to the European Council in Nice on the ongoing work in this area and for the interim structures to be put on a permanent footing as soon as possible thereafter. While much of the Presidency report draws its mandate from decisions at Helsinki, it is important to recall the decisions taken at Lisbon concerning the civilian aspects of crises management. We especially welcome the development of work in this area.</P>
    <P>The individual annexes to the Presidency report dealt with consultations and relations between the EU and third countries. I am happy that the recommendations in this regard for consultation with European non-EU members of NATO are in line with Ireland's open approach to having inclusive and transparent consultation with such countries, provided the EU's decision-making competencies are respected. I made these points in my discussions with the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, during my visit to Oslo yesterday. Similarly, the issue of EU relations with NATO and the use of NATO assets are also dealt with satisfactorily from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the concrete target for the provision of policing support for UN authorised military crisis management missions, for example the KFOR operation in Kosovo. Together with my EU colleagues, I was satisfied to adopt the capability target whereby the EU collectively aims to be able by 2003 to provide some 5,000 police officers to international missions across the range of crisis prevention and crisis management operations. I argued that EU developments in this area should take place in close co-operation with the UN and should avoid duplication of the work of the UN and the OSCE.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that the continued focus of developments in the security and defence area is in line with principles which Ireland can endorse, namely, that such developments fall within the Petersberg Tasks and at all times acknowledge the primary role of the UN in authorising international missions. Equally, I am satisfied that the current developments in the security and defence area fall within existing Treaty provisions and that there is no need to make further Treaty changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>The EU Council noted with satisfaction that, <Col N="145" /> with the exception of the chapter on institutions which cannot be opened until the completion of the intergovernmental conference, all the negotiating chapters have been opened with the so-called Luxembourg candidates: Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus. Similarly, we noted with satisfaction that eight chapters had been opened with Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovakia, and that five chapters had been opened with Bulgaria and Romania.</P>

      <P>What is the position regarding Turkey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with Turkey is that, as agreed at the previous Council meeting, discussions would commence but they have not involved debate on chapters at this stage nor are they likely to for some time. Steady progress is being made in the enlargement negotiations, despite the inevitable difficulties which arise in sensitive areas such as agriculture. However, as I have made clear both in this House and in my meetings with representatives from accession countries, most recently in Poland, Ireland fully supports the earliest possible accession of individual countries on their own merits, so long as all the relevant criteria are met. I was pleased to note that recent studies indicated that the Irish public was among the most supportive of the enlargement process. The Union should seek to help to maintain the momentum within the applicant states for enlargement to ensure the necessary and difficult processes of structural adjustment and legislative and regulatory reform are maintained and accelerated.</P>
      <P>The Lisbon Summit was extremely significant in seeking to define the input by the European Council into the general economic and social strategic management of the Union. Clearly, each of the specific Council formations has unique Treaty-based roles and particular expertise in the execution of its responsibilities. However, it is important that EU leaders provide political direction in the form of a contextual framework for the work of ECOFIN and the other councils to which it primarily falls to achieve the strategic goal set at Lisbon, namely, &ldquo;To become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Feira, we were able to review the progress which has already been made and to take note of a number of important documents, including the e-Europe action plan and the charter for small enterprises. It is important that the Luxembourg process relating to employment and the Cardiff process relating to structural reforms are mutually compatible and inform the development of the annual broad economic policy guidelines. Accordingly, I look forward to the synthesis report which is to be produced by the Commission each year in the run-up to the spring <Col N="146" /> council which, in line with the decisions taken at Lisbon, will allow Heads of State or Government to review in a holistic way the progress made in achieving the Union's strategic goal for the next decade. The annual spring council will also allow for strategic directions to be set across a range of horizontal issues such as the information society and social inclusion, while providing EU leaders with an opportunity to give political guidance in the drawing up by the Commission of the first draft of the broad economic guidelines. The broad economic guidelines for 2000 were welcomed by the Council. The general and country specific guidelines presented no difficulties from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that ECOFIN had a number of formal and informal meetings during the European Council with a view to progressing two key items. One was Greece's entry into the euro and the other was the tax package which has been under discussion for some time. I warmly welcomed the entry of Greece into the euro zone. Greek membership will take effect from 1 January next. The Greek Government has made substantial efforts in recent years to put the Greek economy on a sound footing and I look forward to its participation in a future euro 12 zone. The issue of euro entry will arise in both Denmark and Sweden later this year, and I would also strongly welcome a positive outcome in the case of these two countries.</P>
    <P>As is well known, a tax package has been under discussion at ECOFIN for some time. It consists of three elements: a draft directive on the taxation of the interest on savings, the code of conduct on harmful tax competition, and a draft directive on the taxation of interest and royalties. The first of these items has been under intensive discussion over the past six months and an agreement was finally reached at Feira. It sets out a timetable by which an exchange of information system will be established for the taxation of savings income of non-residents. I strongly supported the decision taken by ECOFIN to reach a comprehensive agreement on all three elements of the tax package as soon as possible and no later than the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will deal extensively with the external relations topics which arose at the Feira Summit. However, I would like to recall the address by President Mbeki of South Africa to the summit and his strong plea for greater engagement by the Union with Africa in tackling both the humanitarian and political difficulties faced in that continent. I had met President Mbeki in South Africa earlier this year and also in Cairo, and I welcomed the opportunity to renew our acquaintance and to thank him for the ongoing contribution being made by his fellow countryman, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, to the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>In addition to meeting informally with President Mbeki, I took the opportunity for discussions with President Sampaio, President Prodi <Col N="147" /> and each of my EU colleagues. I held a formal bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. We discussed a range of issues related to Northern Ireland, including the ongoing and satisfactory work of the Assembly, the Executive and the North-South institutions. We also reviewed the situation regarding the Police Bill when I again emphasised the importance of the Bill faithfully reflecting the recommendations of the Patten commission. The marching season, especially Drumcree, was among the other issues we discussed. Since then, we had in the IRA's confidence building measures a breakthrough of unprecedented proportions. I know the House shares my welcome for this, and our collective gratitude goes to President Martti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I also discussed the tragic deaths of 58 people at Dover. This human tragedy underlines the need for governments to take firm, decisive and tough anti-trafficking measures. Traffickers in human beings are self-serving criminals who have no regard for the dignity or safety of their human cargo. They operate a trade which runs counter to everything the civilised world has sought to achieve to safeguard human rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland is co-operating fully with other EU member states and third countries in working together to defeat the traffickers. One of the major conclusions of the Tampere summit was that an EU-wide instrument should be drawn up to tackle trafficking and to ensure those who engage in this trade will face severe sanctions in all members states. Ireland fully supports this initiative. Our tough anti-trafficking legislation has now been passed by the Oireachtas. Penalties include a maximum of ten years imprisonment for trafficking, forfeiture of vehicles and unlimited fines. Our legislation, which is designed to tackle the profiteers trafficking in people, not asylum seekers, mirrors the provisions in place in the UK and the wider European Union.</P>
    <P>The declaration from the Council, therefore, calls on the French Presidency and the Commission to make urgent progress in developing measures requested at the Tampere summit to stop the criminal networks operating in this area. Ireland has recently applied to participate in key elements of the Schengen arrangements. The Schengen states have agreed to co-operate closely in police and judicial measures to tackle serious criminal activity, including crimes involving trafficking in persons. Ireland intends to take part in the Schengen arrangements that deal with police and judicial co-operation, mutual assistance in criminal matters and drug crimes. Negotiations on our application will have to take place with the Schengen states. On completion of these negotiations the applications will, of course, be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in accordance with constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>Our application to participate in the Schengen <Col N="148" /> arrangements reflects the continuing commitment of this Government to international co-operation to combat organised crime, including those criminal gangs which traffic in human beings.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to commend the Portuguese Government and, in particular, Prime Minister Guterres, on its conduct of the EU Presidency over the last six months. The Presidency succeeded in progressing a range of difficult portfolios against the exceptional backdrop of the EU 14's relations with Austria. The Presidency has demonstrated great skill in its handling of complex issues and has given clear directions for future work for the incoming French Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck, reading the communiqué from the summit at Feira in Portugal, by the emphasis placed on the rule of law and the requirement of the European Union that the rule of law and fair procedure should be seen to apply in the activities of others. In the discussion in Feira the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers declared solemnly that the activities of the European Union should be designed to promote transparency and greater predictability in the legal systems of the partners. In dealing with crisis management, with great sententiousness, the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers even included a special section entitled &ldquo;Strengthening the Rule of Law&rdquo; to ensure the very important principle that no one is the subject of a penalty unless he or she has gone through a fair procedure.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say the rule of law is one of the fundamental marks of European civilisation, the idea that people should not be subject to a penalty until they have had the opportunity to confront their accusers, heard the case against them, answered it and then have the issue decided independently.</P>
      <P>That is what the heads of Government believe should be the case for others but it is not how they behave themselves. The behaviour of the Taoiseach and all the other Prime Ministers in regard to Austria is a disgrace in terms of the application of the fundamental principles of the rule of law. One of those principles is that any person who is to be subject of a sanction should be allowed first to confront his or her accusers and be heard. The Heads of Government, including the Taoiseach, agreed by telephone to impose sanctions on a sovereign, democratic member of the European Union without putting the case to that country or giving its Prime Minister the opportunity to answer on behalf of his country. Diplomatic sanctions were imposed on a sovereign, democratic member of the European Union behind its back and without it being allowed to be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for Premier Gutteres or President Chirac to travel the world talking about how one should apply the rule of law to trials of people or enforce the law of contract in Africa or Asia if they are not prepared to apply the same principles of fairness and due process in the way <Col N="149" /> they do their own business. Let it not be said this is a purely political affair and that due process does not matter in politics. Diplomatic sanctions are being applied in accordance with diplomatic law against a country which was not given a hearing at any stage for its case before those sanctions were imposed. This approach of the member states is polluting the business of the European Union in a most dangerous way.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this matter has not been finally sorted out by the Portuguese Presidency. I have some confidence in Prime Minister Guterres, and his ability to solve this problem because he is a man of good will and Portuguese public opinion is objective about the matter. I have no confidence at all, however, in President Chirac's ability to deal with the matter. He has been playing domestic politics with the issue from the beginning. His approach to this has nothing to do with Austria or with concern for the rights and interests of Austrian citizens. It had everything to do with pursuing a domestic political agenda. The Belgian Government has pursued the same approach in regard to domestic politics and the Vlaams Blok in Flanders, although perhaps with some greater worthiness. Both countries, however, are pursuing domestic politics and using the European Union as a vehicle for that pursuit. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, to some extent, the Taoiseach on at least seeking verbally to separate themselves from the herd that is pursuing this vendetta against the Austrian people because of the decision they made in a free and fair election. I am afraid, however, neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have gone beyond words. They have not taken any action.</P>
    <P>The point must be made that the Irish Government is entirely free to cease the diplomatic sanctions it has now imposed. The Austrian Ambassador is sitting in the Public Gallery. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will not see that man; he is a pariah as far as the Minister is concerned. He will not be spoken to because he comes from a country which, according to the European Union 14, is unworthy of being spoken to by Ministers,<i> untermenschen</i>&ndash; beneath mention in the approach of Ministers communicating with it. I do not accept that. I do not accept such treatment for any country.</P>
    <P>It may be the case that at some stage people with an undesirable past may take part in a coalition Government in this State. Who has a pure past? Who is without sin? Are we to have a situation in which the Spanish or French will refuse to see the Irish Ambassador because they do not like something said by the former leader of a minor party of a coalition in Dublin?</P>
    <P>I have the strongest sense of opposition to the politics of the far right as pursued in some European countries. I realise there is a problem but there was a problem with Austria long before the Freedom Party entered Government. The country had a system of patronage which was polluting <Col N="150" /> the Austrian political system and there was a political monopoly in the hands of two parties, something which was profoundly unhealthy. Something had to give and the Austrian electorate decided that a change should take place.</P>
    <P>We must, at European level, combat the far right. However, we must combat it through the use of reason and not by hypocrisy. It is hypocritical to preach the concept of the rule of law or the idea that people should not be tried and sentenced without being heard and not to practice what we preach when it comes to dealing with democratic states and the results of democratic elections. Failing to practice what you preach in the matter of the rule of law and democratic practices will not impress the young men who, in the main, are joining far right parties. These people feel threatened by the pace of change and have been left behind by such change. They are the casualties of other countries' equivalent of the Celtic tiger, people who have fallen by the wayside.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the people to whom I refer will be won back to democratic politics if democratic politicians fail to practice what they preach in respect of the application of due process to the making of decisions. If this procedure of sanction continues, there is every risk that Austrian public opinion will become increasingly alienated. There is a serious risk that the Danish electorate will reject membership of the euro. If they do, it will be mainly as a result of the fact that the 14 Prime Ministers decided to meddle in the internal affairs of a member state, namely, Austria. That argument is being adduced by opponents as an argument against Danish membership of the euro, even though it has no bearing whatever on the Danish decision to join the euro.</P>
    <P>I note that progress towards an agreed approach to the taxation of savings has been significantly delayed by the position adopted by Austria. Having reflected on the matter, I do not believe the Austrian Government is correct in organising a referendum on the EU position. To do that is simply to descend to the same idiotic level to which the EU Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers descended. Austria should not follow the Prime Ministers along that road of demagoguery. The organisation of such a referendum in Austria will be nothing more than a reaction to the demagoguery of the Prime Ministers of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of other issues. I note that a substantial chapter was agreed at the summit on the issue of military co-operation. I also note that legal advice from the Commission's legal services has been put before the Heads of Government regarding whether arrangements for military co-operation can be put in place without an amendment to the treaty. The Council's legal services have been unable to provide a clear and definitive opinion on that point.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to clarify the position later.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Taoiseach's comments in respect of the deaths of 58 people in Dover. It was interesting that he did not comment on the restrictive nature of the immigration regimes in member states. He appeared to take the view that the only people to blame are those who traffic in human beings. I agree that the people to whom he referred must accept responsibility in this area. However, it is important to recognise that in the past people from this country were assisted in escaping from persecution here. These people were admitted to other countries where they became refugees. I refer here to John Mitchell, who was assisted in escaping from Australia and travelling to the United States, and Thomas Francis Meagher, who was assisted in escaping from Ireland and also in travelling to the United States. Many Irish people were asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is effectively saying that anyone who receives money for helping asylum seekers should be subject to a maximum of ten years in prison for trafficking, forfeiture of vehicles and unlimited fines. It might be argued that these people are not genuine asylum seekers. However, one cannot know whether they are genuine asylum seekers or whether they have a genuine case to be treated as refugees until after they have arrived in one's jurisdiction. Anybody who assists a person in immigrating into the European Union, regardless of whether they are genuine refugees &ndash; this will be decided later &ndash; will be subject to the penalties to which I refer. There are those who could be helping people to escape from genuine political persecution who will be subjected to these penalties, without the application of political consideration, in precisely the same way as individuals who, for purely financial motives, help people to enter Europe. I hope <Col N="152" /> that in its approach to this matter the European Union will recognise that it should be able to make a distinction between those who are genuine refugees and those who are not. Under the current approach, such distinctions cannot be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of items from the very comprehensive and substantial communiqué which was issued after the summit. A debate on that communiqué could take a great deal of time and I do not doubt that we will hold such a debate in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin by commenting on the institutional issues surrounding the intergovernmental conference and the proposal for a charter of fundamental rights. The Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;It was clear from our discussions that a majority of member states wish that the charter would remain a political declaration.&rdquo; Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he has the relevant information in his possession, indicate the member states which are opposed to the production of a legal document, either within the timeframe of the Intergovernmental Conference &ndash; a virtual impossibility &ndash; or at some time thereafter, and the member states which are opposed, in principle, to the introduction of a legally binding document? How will such a document be enshrined in a European Union treaty as distinct from the existing European Convention on Human Rights, by the legal structure in Strasbourg?</P>
      <P>Many people in this country would like to see developments proceeding in this area, particularly as we move towards an ever closer union of the peoples of Europe. Having disposed of certain items that were merely commercial in nature, such as the original Common Market project, and moved towards completing the Internal Market and the harmonisation of many other matters, if we are to create a sense of citizenship among the citizens of the European Union we must examine the possibility of introducing and enshrining in a treaty a set of shared constitutional and fundamental rights. I am aware that the time frame for the Treaty of Nice, effectively six months from now, will make the composition of such a legal document a virtual impossibility. Nevertheless, the Minister for Foreign Affairs could outline the numeric political balance and the Irish Government's current position on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not yet clear whether a referendum would be strictly necessary in legal terms if we are dealing with the Amsterdam leftovers. That will depend on the Intergovernmental Conference's recommendations. I invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to indicate that if Ireland wishes the <Col N="153" /> legitimacy of the European project to be underwritten, it would be politically desirable to hold a referendum on this issue, notwithstanding the possible legal advice which may be received from the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Attorney General. The current Minister with his legal expertise and long experience of politics is well aware that any Government which might attempt, on the basis of legal advice, to suggest that a referendum would not be necessary to give effect to the Treaty of Nice would immediately find itself challenged by a group or groups of people. I respectfully suggest that could lead to Crotty mark II. Let us not risk creating a situation where a challenge could be made and where the courts could very well find against the legal advice, as they did in regard to the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting this course of action simply to avoid an unnecessary legal wrangle. The ever closer union of the European project should be underwritten by a referendum in the Irish context, as happened with the Maastricht Treaty with respect to the Republic of France. That was a risk which was taken at the time after the Danes had voted and it very nearly backfired on the French. If we consider the declining level of support for the European project among Irish citizens and combine that with the reality that the intergovernmental conference proposals, in their final form, will not have any cash or financial inducement for the Irish electorate, we should hold a referendum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the implicit advances outlined in the Taoiseach's speech to the effect that one Commissioner will be retained per member state, that there will be changes in the weighted majority and that qualified majority voting will be extended. We can live with those changes which have been argued for by all parties in this House which favour the European project. To summarise, I would like the Minister to outline the political situation in regard to those countries which do not wish to see a charter of fundamental rights being incorporated into the EU treaties and the current Irish position on the matter.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to economics and the welcome recognition by the Council that the Republic of Greece or the Hellenic Republic now qualifies quite substantially for participation in the single currency, an economic feat which we should acknowledge. We should salute our Greek colleagues for the extraordinary transformation which has been effected in their economy in recent years which is on a similar scale to our own although it does not share the same characteristics as our recent economic advancement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would address the question alluded to in the Taoiseach's contribution when he stated that Sweden and Denmark may decide to join the single currency later this year. There is a political as well as an economic motive behind this. The Euro 11 will become Euro 12 on 1 January and if the Danes also vote to join the single currency &ndash; I understand the referendum <Col N="154" /> is due to take place on 24 September &ndash; pressure will be exerted on the Swedes to join too and there will be a 12 month window before the implementation of the notes and coins becomes a reality. If those two Nordic states were to join the single currency to make it the Euro 13 or Euro 14 zone, the consequent pressure exerted on the UK to join would be far stronger and the economic test for Chancellor Brown would be made slightly easier because the balance of trade would shift significantly in terms of Britain's position <i>vis à vis</i> the rest of the European Union. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs share my view that it would be desirable to have monetary union on this island and to ensure that that division between these two islands is eliminated sooner rather than later. Perhaps the Minister would inform the House of his assessment of the situation in Denmark and Sweden and outline when Sweden might opt to join the single currency if Denmark decides to join following the referendum. Does the Minister share my view that the probable date for one or other of those countries joining would be 1 January next year?</P>
    <P>I have a problem with this format of dialogue and an argument could be made about how the smaller parties in this House could be facilitated. Perhaps in addition to providing a plenary response on the floor of the House, a Member of Government could in future be briefed to attend the Joint Committee on European Affairs on a bi-annual basis to provide an updated report on the vast array of subjects to which the communiqué refers, none of which can be adequately raised in the format of a series of statements and none of which can be adequately responded to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

The first point that strikes me, having read the Taoiseach's speech, is the degree to which the concept of a transcendent project of European citizenship, such as was envisaged by President Santer in some of his early speeches to the Commission, seems to have receded considerably. Very few people now speak of a European citizenship. When one examines polls of interest in Europe and approval of European policies across all of the EU's member states, one notes an interesting contradiction, namely that member state governments are very much in favour of Europe, as are most parliamentary assemblies, yet citizens in practically all of the member state countries are showing a marked disinterest, sometimes even hostility, to the European project. This raises the question of whether it is possible to create a transcendent project which would rise above particular national interests and embrace the best aspirations of Europe, taking its historic interest in rights and democratic forms of administration into account in an attempt to envisage <Col N="155" /> the future. We seem to be perilously ignoring this omission, which has flown in and out of European consideration at different times, in the discussion on Europe.</P>
      <P>If we consider the speech made by President Chirac on 30 May envisaging the French presidency, it is interesting to note the rather vague description of flexibility which the French seem to favour &ndash; I use the word &ldquo;vague&rdquo; in so far as the areas in which flexibility might be applied, for what purposes and towards which end are not specified. I am far more interested in the overall vision outlined by President Chirac which seems to envisage a Europe at peace following the considerable expansion of military capacity.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of grave concern to many, particularly those who see any military action as an action of last resort and who have carefully mapped out those matters upon which it is appropriate to have unarmed intervention, peacekeeping, peace making and so on, and a list of tasks which it might be in the humanitarian interest to advance. The overall thrust of the speech by President Chirac to the presidential committee of the WE parliamentary assembly in Paris on 13 May seems to be predicated on an enhanced military capacity in the first instance followed by, as it were, a consequent peace.</P>
      <P>There are other matters in regard to that speech that would raise great concern as core values in international policy. There is a very flawed analysis of the appropriate attitude of the European Union towards the Balkans. There is a residue of the old, dated, infamous Thatcherite thinking that Europe had in the past not only related to the rest of the world but, as she said, &ldquo;civilised the rest of the world&rdquo;. There is a development model suggested which argues that different countries, including aspects of the applicant countries, will come up to the mark and make the grade as regards democratic reform. I question this on historical grounds and on grounds of moral principle in relation to the appropriate principles of international policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is flawed because we have not sufficient concentration on the transcendent project of a European citizenship which would be something we could share, of <i>humanité</i>, based on rights and might be part of the general project, but rather we have been much more comfortable in following the economic expansion. In the speech given by the Taoiseach and the statements made by other participants following Feira there is an uncritical view of globalisation. I have placed on the record of this House the uneven impact of globalisation not only on Europe but on the world. What is happening in Europe in applicant countries and in existing members of the EU is that those who are excluded from the alleged universal benefits of globalisation are discovering and inventing forms of ethnicity and identity as a response to their exclusion. One cannot deal with what is happening politically in any of these countries given their history and contemporary situa<Col N="156" /> tion without taking into account the uneven impact of globalisation. It is not an even evolutionary development. Look at what emerged at Feira. The intergovernmental conference, even as it rumbles on towards Nice at the end of the year, is preparing to be much more an economic bloc in competition with other blocs than deepening its connection with European citizens in practically every member country. It is a dangerous position for the existing members and the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>A host of questions arise. Is there to be a common attitude towards the reintroduction of a new round of trade talks in the WTO? One must bear in mind that there is no common position between the foreign policy expressions of a number of members of the EU on that matter and there is even less so on the perceived difference emerging between what was the shell of UNCTAD, which had a high participation of less developed countries, and the WTO. A round of trade talks on the previous model in which the EU would participate is simply not on. That is the litmus test.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Feira agenda did not receive much publicity. If one is to speak meaningfully of Africa, it lost $3 billion of trade after the Uruguay round which gave the greatest benefits to the European Union. One cannot have it every way. What we have had is more of the same in terms of developments on the economic front that are creating an economic bloc capable of competing with the United States or countries led by Japan, but is singularly lacking in relation to anything like a transcendent project at foreign policy level. What is disappointing about the other speeches and participants &ndash; I do not refer to the Minister &ndash; is the subjugation of what might be regarded as a refined diplomatic position to cover military positions. One continually defeats the other and I discern grave concerns in President Chirac's speech.</P>
    <P>When the EU meets in Feira and other places it should bear certain facts in mind. There has been a significant fall in income in the world. The points I make regarding globalisation must be addressed. The Minister has been forthright in answering questions I put to him on the institutional changes suggested. Is the suggestion that during the French Presidency credence should be given to the idea of a two speed Europe not proof of what I am saying, that an economic engine is being identified while at the same time the larger project of European citizenship is being neglected? Is this not the real reason people do not want to take on the obligation of a charter of rights that would establish real obligations as opposed to an aspirational political statement? Is the net result of these rhetorical questions not one that is putting us into a perilous position as Deputy Quinn suggests? Are we not in urgent need of real debate on the future of Europe in terms of its ethics, foreign policy, international relations, attitude to international institutions, the balance of relations between Britain as part of <Col N="157" /> the North Atlantic alliance and other countries that are members of the EU? We will be ill served unless such a debate is generated and widely participated in before we take fundamental decisions on the future structure of Europe.</P>

      <P>The Feira summit allowed us, as the Taoiseach said, to take stock of a number of issues. The general subjects that have dominated this debate, the intergovernmental conference, the direction of Europe, the ability to broaden and develop the EU simultaneously, are matters that require much thought and detail. There is a commitment to enlargement. There is a recognition that in terms of allowing the benefits of European unity to be available to emerging democracies and those African countries that have indicated an interest in joining the EU,that in itself is part of the democratisation that has taken place in the wider European and post-Cold War situation. It is also important to consider the EU's ability, from its own security perspective, to integrate applicant countries, their economies and societies, into the biggest consumer market in the world, the ability to allow democratic forces in those countries to form Governments which can be part of the integration of the European economy which would be of benefit to their people while recognising their own cultural traditions and backgrounds. Clearly that has been the focus and impetus for enlargement which resulted in the historic decisions in Helsinki that propose the most ambitious enlargement yet envisioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must also take account of the fact that <Col N="158" /> while broadening the Union, the EU's ability to have an effective decision-making process is something to which we are all bound to apply our minds. That is not just a matter for member states but also for applicant countries. We must not end up with a paralysis in the Union's decision-making process which would militate against the continuing progress and prosperity of member states while also militating against the ability of applicant countries to integrate into the new, enlarged Union. There is also the related question of how one deepens the Union and ensures that the project which has been going on for the past 40 years continues to evolve as it has in the past, deepening the relationships between member states and bringing about common action in areas which, with globalisation as the background, clearly require such action for effective decision-making for European citizens. We must recognise that the EU is a union of peoples and states and the shared sovereignty that is part of the decision-making process must continue to be progressed in a way which will maintain a consensus in the Union and allow it to proceed in the way envisaged by the member states at European Council meetings such as in Feira.</P>
    <P>Fundamental questions are emerging and are being driven to the forefront by enlargement. There are varying levels of agreement, and some disagreement, as to how we proceed from here, and much debate will take place in the next six months under the French Presidency on the basis that everyone is committed to making decisions at the intergovernmental conference at the Nice summit. I hope the debate taking place at European level is reflected in our Parliament and committee debates so that there is a common understanding of the issues involved. Our economy is open and has benefited greatly from integration with the European economy. We need to debate issues, such as the affiliation of citizens to European institutions, far more and in far greater detail in the next six months so that the electorate understands the issues and the pros and cons of the package that will emerge at Nice.</P>
    <P>Our discussions with the incoming French Presidency have shown that it will be a package. The number of Commissioners and the areas in which qualified majority voting will apply are issues to be considered, as is the reweighting of votes, the new European Parliament of a maximum of 700 MEPs in an enlarged Union and the operation of the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and so on. As we progress into an enlarged Union, these are fundamental issues for the institutions. The overall approach of our Government is to ensure that the institutional balance is maintained. We believe very strongly that the Commission is a very important institution in relation to moderating the relationships between large and small states as well as developed and less developed states, but it is also the organ of initiative. The Commission is the guarantor of the treaties and ensures that the EU develops in the way envis<Col N="159" /> aged by the treaties. It is the legal guardian of the legal basis of the treaties.</P>
    <P>Our position is that the retention of one Commissioner per member state is fundamental, not on the basis that the Commissioner is a representative of the member state but that the institutional balance within the Union dictates that if one wants affiliation and acceptance of EU decisions in some competitive area, it would be far more difficult to ensure that happens in member states that do not have Commission representation than in those that have. The basis on which the Union has proceeded up to now &ndash; the entitlement of every state to a commmissionership &ndash; has been one which we feel is an absolute requirement for our negotiating position.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to look at extended areas of qualified majority voting and to come to conclusions on the reweighting of votes at Council, but we need to know that the requirement of a Commissioner for each member state is to be retained in the new scenario and we are prepared to enter discussions on that basis. Another important issue raised at Feira regarding the intergovernmental conference was the inclusion of flexibility for discussion in the next six months. The proponents of flexibility would argue that this is an inclusive rather than exclusive concept. They talk about the need for more effective decision-making and the fact that, in the absence of flexibility mechanisms being put in place &ndash; we already have flexibility mechanisms under the treaties but we need to modify them so they can be used more frequently &ndash; and the absence of coming to agreement on those issues, the possibility of member states proceeding in co-operation outside the treaties is not something that is in the interest of EU unity. We must, therefore, find a balance.</P>
    <P>We do not fear any flexibility mechanism. We are prepared to look at the present situation where, under Article 43 of the general treaties in the European Union treaty itself, there is a provision for a majority of states to proceed with enhanced co-operation subject to any member state appealing to the Council. We are prepared to look at modifying that, but we feel we need to know what areas are envisaged for enhanced co-operation so that the overall balance within the Union, and its basic cohesion, is not compromised. I hope the Feira summit has indicated we are moving from the conceptual to the pragmatic &ndash; recent General Affairs Council meetings have certainly indicated this. We need to know, for our negotiating strategy, what areas the proponents of flexibility propose should be used in an enhanced co-operation mechanism. If we can do that on the basis of maintaining the present <i>acquis</i>, which is what the French Presidency is saying to us through Foreign Minster Vedrine, we are prepared to discuss those issues, but we need to see the practicalities of the matter in operation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the European Convention on Human Rights, it has been suggested that it will <Col N="160" /> be a political declaration in the first instance. The first draft will go to the Biarritz meeting and we will then decide at Nice how and whether it should form part of treaties in the future. However, I do not believe that a consensus will emerge prior to Nice which would allow it to become part of the treaties immediately and there would be worries among states with both written and unwritten constitutions as to the implications of such a measure, particularly in relation to bringing forward duplication of a human rights charter over and above the European Council. It shows, as has been said, that we need to discuss these issues in more detail at either the foreign affairs or European affairs committees. I would be glad to do so with interested Deputies.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Finance Bill before the House. It provides for the stamp duty measures which were contained in the Financial Resolution passed by this House on Thursday, 15 June, as well as the new anti-speculative housing tax. As I outlined to the House on 15 June, the aim of the taxation measures is to help curb transitory or speculative demand for housing. By doing this, the measures should strengthen in the market the position of first time buyers and other owner-occupiers. The background to the measures is the most recent study of the housing market conducted by Peter Bacon and Associates, Economic Consultants.</P>
      <P>The taxation measures, in addition to a number of further measures which my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, have announced, are part of the Government's ongoing response to the problems in the housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has always been proactive on housing policy. It commissioned the previous two Bacon studies and on both occasions responded speedily to the findings. For example, I introduced a number of significant changes to the tax <Col N="161" /> treatment of housing which were incorporated in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, following the findings of the first Bacon report on house prices. I also acted in the Finance Act, 1999, on foot of the second Bacon report.</P>
    <P>These previous measures have made an impact on the housing market. The most recent Bacon report concluded that the rates of increase in prices of both new and second hand houses have slowed sharply since the middle of 1998, which is the point when the Government measures to redress market imbalance were implemented. The latest figures received from the Department of the Environment and Local Government show a significant slowdown in 1999 in the rate of price increases for new and second hand houses in and outside Dublin and this has continued into this year.</P>
    <P>While the measures which the Government has taken previously have been successful in moderating house price increases, the consultants' report acknowledges that further economic growth in the past two years, together with falling interest rates in 1999 and migration inflows, have added to housing demand. Demand has increased at a greater rate than anticipated two years ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, while average house price inflation has moderated, the level of average new house prices is still presenting a problem for lower income groups and in particular first time buyers wishing to enter the market. Government action to improve the supply of housing has shown positive results, as evidenced by the record number of house completions of more than 46,500 in 1999, the fifth consecutive year of record housing output. The further measures being implemented now to increase housing supply will contribute further to the recent moderation in house price increases. Clearly, we are going in the right direction but results take time.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government's measures, in this Bill and in the other responses is to: maximise housing output to meet the continuing strong demand for housing; curb short-term speculative demand; strengthen the position of first-time purchasers in the market; increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet rising housing needs and improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply. These measures are a coherent and considered response and will deliver the results that the House desires.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the specific taxation measures in the Bill. Part 1 deals with the new stamp duty measures for residential property. A three tiered rate structure will apply for first time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first time buyers and investors. Section 2 deals with the commencement date of the new stamp duty measures. These measures apply to conveyances dated on or after 15 June 2000. However, pipeline cases disadvantaged under the new structure have been catered for, where a contract in writing was in place before 15 June 2000 to purchase a resi<Col N="162" /> dential property and the conveyance takes place on or before 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 detail the new stamp duty rates applying to residential property. This now means that: residential property purchased by first-time buyers up to £150,000 will be exempt; for other owner-occupiers properties up to £100,000 will be exempt; first time buyers will benefit from a cut in stamp duty for second hand properties up to £300,000; owner-occupiers will also gain from lower rates for houses up to £300,000 and, in the case of investors, they will see a significant increase in rates. A flat 9% stamp duty charge will apply to all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property for conveyances executed on or after 15 June 2000. The fundamental aims of the changes to the stamp duty regime are to facilitate first time buyers and to discourage speculative investment in the lower range of the market.</P>
    <P>Part 2 deals with the new anti-speculative property tax. This tax will apply to residential property in the State which is acquired on or after 15 June 2000 which is not an individual's principal private residence. This tax is a further measure aimed at discouraging speculative investment in the market. It is not an anti-investor tax. It is essential that we have a vibrant, professionally run private rented sector, but we also need to discourage speculative investment. Exemptions will therefore be available in specific instances.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a definitions section. This section also provides that the tax will not apply in respect of qualifying residential investment properties under section 23 relief, including properties which benefit from a tax incentive under the following schemes: the Custom House docks area scheme; the Temple Bar area scheme; the 1994 urban renewal scheme; the seaside resorts scheme; the islands scheme; the new urban renewal scheme; the rural renewal scheme; the scheme of residential accommodation for certain students; the rented residential accommodation element of the park and ride scheme and the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Exemptions will also be provided for certain heritage-type residential properties as well as registered and listed holiday homes. Landlords who comply with certain regulations made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, will be exempted from the tax. It is also envisaged that exemptions will be available in future for landlords who comply with the standards and requirements of a new regulatory regime, to be put in place following consideration of the forthcoming report by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the charge to the tax. The 2% rate will apply for a period of three years on the market value of all relevant residential property with effect from 6 April 2001. Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 outline further exemptions applying to this tax. The purchase of a residential property which will be an individual's principal private residence will not give rise to the anti-speculative <Col N="163" /> property tax. However, where an individual changes principal private residence on 9 or after 15 June while retaining ownership of his or her previous residence, the latter property will come within the scope of the tax, even if owned before 15 June 2000. The tax will not apply to residential properties received through inheritance or, in the case of gifts, if the property was owned by the donor before 15 June 2000. Similarly, residential property held in a discretionary trust prior to 15 June 2000 will not be liable to the tax. Residential property built after 14 June 2000 on land which was owned prior to this date will be exempt. The tax will not apply to residential property held by charities.</P>
    <P>As with stamp duty there will be transitional provisions for individuals who had entered into written contracts before 15 June to buy a residential investment property. Section 12 provides that the tax will be charged on the market value of the property. Sections 13 to 25 provide for the administrative aspects of the tax. It is a self-assessment tax which will last for three years. Those liable to the tax must make a return and pay the tax to the Revenue Commissioners on or before 1 November of each of the three years up to 2003 when this tax will apply.</P>
    <P>The tax due will be 2% of the market value of all non-exempt residential property owned by the person on 6 April each year but where the property was acquired and fully paid for between 15 June 2000 and 6 April 2001, the price paid is taken as the market value of the property on that date. Each person with an ownership interest is liable for the tax to the extent of his or her proportionate interest in the property.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 and 27 deal with the care and management provisions and relate to the Short Title, respectively. I have tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage. If further fine-tuning is needed to the anti-speculative tax before it comes into effect on 6 April, we can do this in next year's Finance Bill. The measures in this Finance Bill are an appropriate response by Government and must be viewed together with the other measures being taken as part of an overall package. I am confident these measures will assist those people who wish to enter the housing market, in particular those who are trying to purchase their first homes.</P>
    <P>I have stated previously that this Government is not prepared to countenance the possible development of a situation where the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant proportion of people who reasonably aspire to it. As well as the social problems that this would cause, it would present difficulties for the wider economy in the shape of adding to wage demands and in reducing mobility in the labour market. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has been in office for almost three years and for almost all <Col N="164" /> that time there has been an astronomical rise in the price of houses. Many young couples can no longer afford to buy their own homes, particularly in the greater Dublin area. People such as teachers, gardaí, nurses and civil servants cannot buy their own homes and are seeking to leave Dublin or planning to commute from far-flung midland towns.</P>
      <P>On three occasions the Government has retained the services of Dr. Peter Bacon and on three occasions it has failed to understand the analysis of the housing crisis in the Bacon reports. The relevant Ministers in the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government have either ignored or failed to implement the principal proposals made by Dr. Bacon.</P>
      <P>This is Dr. Bacon's third throw of the dice and just as previous actions taken by the Government failed, this measure will fail. The Government, particularly the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government, do not understand the housing market. They have grasped the notion that there is a mismatch between the supply of and the demand for houses, but have failed to realise that supply and demand are inextricably linked in the housing market and that many of the actions taken to reduce demand also reduce supply as developers adjust to new market conditions.</P>
      <P>This point is illustrated by one example from the first Bacon report. Arising from that report, tax relief on mortgages on rented accommodation was abolished. Investors left the market and the supply of rented accommodation remained static, or was marginally reduced. The natural increase in those seeking rented accommodation could not be satisfied. Rents were forced up, the investors came back and the market found a new equilibrium. The measure had no effect on the price of houses which continued to rise, particularly for first time buyers. It was of no benefit, however, because rents rose as it impacted very seriously on the rented sector. As a consequence, the measure had an adverse impact on the housing market.</P>
      <P>Two of the principal proposals in the Finance (No. 2) Bill will have a similar effect. The imposition of stamp duty at 9% on residential investment property will have the same effect as the abolition of mortgage interest relief on rented accommodation. Some investors will be driven out of the market but the supply of rented accommodation, which is already scarce, will become even more scarce and rents will increase. The so called speculator tax at 2% will have the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only does the Government not understand the relationship between supply and demand in the housing market, it also fails to realise that the market is seamless. Dr. Bacon has informed it that approximately 55,000 units of accommodation are required each year for the foreseeable future and that the market is only capable of supplying about 45,000 of these units. These figures, however, derive from an estimate of the total <Col N="165" /> number of people seeking to buy houses, persons seeking to rent and those on local authority housing lists. If the Government builds more local authority houses, fewer houses will need to be provided by the private sector. If more people buy their own homes, local authority waiting lists will become shorter and pressure on the rental market will ease. If more people rent satisfactorily, fewer people will need to purchase or be housed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The converse is also true. Any measure which reduces the supply of new houses, the supply of accommodation available for rent or the supply of local authority houses, not only impacts adversely on that segment of the market but on the whole market, because the market is seamless and young persons in rented accommodation may eventually own their own homes or seek to be housed by a local authority. Prices will only stabilise when supply matches demand. It is quite clear that the principal Ministers involved in the formulation and implementation of housing policy do not understand the implications of this truism. By reducing demand in the rented sector one reduces the total supply of houses. The Government has made this mistake before and it is now making it again.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the reduction in stamp duty for first time buyers of second-hand houses and welcomes the reduction in stamp duty on lower value houses for persons trading up. These measures are beneficial. They have been advocated by Fine Gael for more than three years, but on the three or four occasions we put the matter to the test, the Minister for Finance rejected any move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The reduction in stamp duty in respect of these categories will not have a major impact on the price of houses as young couples faced with a continuing price spiral will tend to use their stamp duty savings to acquire a house costing thousands of pounds more than they can afford at present.</P>
    <P>The Government must think again. It must ensure that a sufficient supply of zoned, serviced building land is available in Dublin and throughout the country. Over three years, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has failed to do so and has even failed to spend the money allocated to him by the Minister for Finance for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Ministers in the Department of the Environment and Local Government must stop interfering in an adverse manner and ensure that the practice in local authorities is in line with national policy. At present the national policy is to expand the supply of houses while every local authority is imposing more planning restrictions which reduce the supply. As a result, national policy is going in one direction and local policy is going in the opposite direction. It is ludicrous that Ministers in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, through local authorities, cannot bring national and local policy into line in the middle of a housing crisis. The Department must adopt Fine Gael's proposal which is now con<Col N="166" /> tained in the third Bacon report, namely that strategic planning areas must be designated and delays in planning must be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The 2% tax on speculation is a very curious tax. So many types of residential accommodation are excluded in the Bill, the Government would be wise to drop the idea completely. Only 10% of houses which are rented are registered with local authorities. We must conclude that the other 90% of owners are not tax compliant. If these owners are evading income tax it is very unlikely they will subject themselves to this new 2% tax on a self-assessment basis.</P>
    <P>It is logical to make the exclusions contained in section 5, in particular to exclude residential developments which the Government encouraged through the use of tax breaks. It would be completely perverse to encourage through tax breaks on the one hand while penalising on the other by way of a speculative tax. The problem is that by the time one comes to the end of the section there is so little left it seems that all we have is a tax on holiday homes built by people out of their own resources, and which are not speculative in any way.</P>
    <P>The main victims of this tax will be people who build holiday homes on the south and west coasts. These people do not rent out these homes but stay in them for a month in the summer, a couple of weekends per year and at Christmas. There may be some strange theory that if the small builder from west Cork is not building a holiday home in the area he will transfer to Dublin and build a housing estate, and that this measure will free up transferable resources. That is nonsense. I know from where it comes and I have read the theory, but it has nothing to do with the real world or with small builders on the west coast. This measure is an attack on one of the essential ingredients in the economies of tourism counties on the west and south coasts. Anyone who builds a holiday home after 15 June will have to pay 2% of the market value for the next three years.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the other category which does not involve speculation either. Country people, professionals, business people or PAYE taxpayers who buy an apartment in one of the university cities to accommodate their children in college will also be caught by this tax. This activity is not speculative but simply involves people buying accommodation for their children who go to college. Some will have one child but others will be brought in and they will make their own arrangements.They need a roof over their heads when they are at university.</P>
    <P>If we go back to first principles and match supply with demand, these students are also taken into account in Dr. Bacon's recommendation of 55,000 units of accommodation every year. It is absolute nonsense to describe retired people, public servants, teachers and those with a fair amount of free time, who invest their savings, lump sum or pension in a holiday home in the west or along the south coast as speculators, hammer them with a 2% tax for the next three years <Col N="167" /> and pretend this will do something for the housing market in Dublin. The same applies in reverse to country people who buy small houses or apartments for their children who are attending college &ndash; to dub them speculators is equally nonsensical. These are the two principal categories to whom the 2% tax will apply if they acquire a new holiday home or apartment after 15 June this year.</P>
    <P>When the exclusions are taken into account and allowing for the weakness or the non-existence of the anti-avoidance measures in the Bill, the payment of this tax will be honoured more in the breach than the observance. This will be a marginal tax which will stop people from building holiday homes. The electricians and blocklayers in south Kerry or west Cork will not be kept busy and they will probably draw the dole during the winter because there is not much economic activity there anyway. They will not go to Dublin 4 to build townhouses.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the housing crisis is cosmetic. It fails to understand the housing market. It cannot deal with the problem and now, late in its life, it is trying to pull irons from the fire with ill-conceived cosmetic proposals, which I do not think originated with the Minister. For all his faults and failings, he understands the real Ireland and I doubt these measures came from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to exaggerate the scale of the Government's failure in relation to the housing market. It is worth looking at some statistics in that regard. Since the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government came to power, three years ago this week, the average price of a new house nationwide has almost doubled from just over £70,000 to over £130,000. The average price of a new house in Dublin has increased from £84,000 to more than £160,000. Average rent has nearly doubled and the numbers on the local authority house waiting list have increased to 40,000. The number of people officially recognised as homeless is more than 5,000, many of whom, unfortunately, are children.</P>
      <P>This is a lamentable record by any standards, not least because many of the factors which brought it about were entirely foreseeable. Many of the factors which gave rise to increased demand were spelt out with some clarity by Dr. Peter Bacon in his first report just two years ago. What is most remarkable about the third Bacon report is that much of the analysis is exactly the same as the two previous reports. Not only is the analysis the same but so are many of the suggested solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago, Dr. Bacon identified lack of supply as the primary problem. There was general agreement on that &ndash; I agreed and I said so at the time. Dr. Bacon still takes that view and so do I but I think we are entitled to ask what has happened since 1998. Two years ago Dr. Bacon identified infrastructural problems as being at the <Col N="168" /> core of our problem. He argued that we needed to provide the road structure and the public transport infrastructure before we built the houses or at least at the same time. To do this we need a minimum of two measures. We need a national spatial plan and specific plans to deal with the development of the major urban areas such as Dublin, Cork, Galway, and, in deference to Deputy Noonan, Limerick. Two years later there is no sign of either.</P>
    <P>The Government has no intention of producing a national spatial plan this side of the next election, taking a rather generous view of when that might be. As recently as last month, the Government acknowledged a national spatial plan will not be in place before the end of 2001. I do not know whether this is a reluctance to grasp some difficult political nettles or simple lethargy, but the end result is the same. A fundamental component of any housing strategy will not be in place for at least another two years.</P>
    <P>The same applies, even more unforgivably, to the Dublin plan. First, the Government farmed out the plan to Brady, Shipman and Martin. The brief they were given, not just by the Government but by local authorities and other interested parties, was too narrow because there was too much focus on controlling the expenditure it might entail. The result is a conservative and inadequate plan upon which the Government has so far failed to act. The Department of Public Enterprise is still evaluating many of the proposals with the result that we still do not know what the Government intends to do, much less how and when it intends to do it.</P>
    <P>The serviced land initiative is another case in point. The Government trumpeted the initiative two years ago, yet Dr. Bacon reports that not a single additional site came on stream in Dublin last year as a result of the initiative. Dr. Bacon calls this disappointing &ndash; I would put it more strongly than that. It is a measure of lamentable failure. This Government has been too slow to recognise the crisis, too slow to identify the reasons for the crisis and far too slow in doing anything about it. The result is that hundreds of thousands of people can no longer expect to own their own homes and many of them will have great difficulty in securing any home at all in the short-term.</P>
    <P>What is the position now? We have two related problems. First, the supply of houses is inadequate to meet overall demand. Second, and I say this only in the context of limited supply, the wrong people are getting those units that are available. This Bill looks to address the second of these issues. The Government's defence of its inaction in the past few years usually centres on the deceleration in the rate of increase in house prices, which is repeated in the Bacon report. This lends a note of complacency to the report which is unhelpful but it also plays down the fact that house prices are already far too high for most people to afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> To afford a 90% mortgage on an average new house in Dublin a young couple would need to be earning more than twice the average industrial wage. It follows that an average young couple cannot afford an average new house and this is reflected in the fact that the average price paid by first time buyers is less than the average price of a new house. This obviously means they are required to lower their sights in terms of what they can afford but it is now clear that even that option will not be available for very much longer. Dr. Bacon importantly points out that the rate of house price inflation experienced by first time buyers is a lot higher than the average increase.</P>
    <P>In summary, the people who are losing out most are the most vulnerable, namely the first time buyers. This cannot be allowed to continue. This is not news &ndash; it has been obvious for some considerable time. Members on these benches having been saying so for some considerable time. We did not need a third Bacon report to tell us what almost every Deputy in this House knew. Those of us on these benches who have been contributing to debates on housing and finance have been arguing for precisely the measures which the Minister has put before us today. The sad fact is that average house prices are already out of reach for many first time buyers and the Minister's belated efforts will be far less effective now than they would have been a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I did last week, that it will be necessary to take investors out of the market, at least temporarily, to create space for first time buyers. This will almost inevitably have regrettable consequences, primarily in the rental sector. It is important, therefore, that these measures are seen as temporary crisis measures. The Labour Party has argued for other measures beyond what is contained in the Bacon report and what the Government seems to be willing to contemplate in terms of direct intervention in the compulsory purchase of land, either by a dedicated housing agency or, alternatively, by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to address a central question. It has been suggested in this House and elsewhere, including by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that a small number of landowners or developers are hoarding land. Dr. Bacon is mute on this and I would be interested to know the Minister's view. If he accepts the thesis that land is being hoarded, he needs to take steps to ensure that land is brought on to the market. There are no such measures in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> noting that the Government's economic policy lacks coherence and foresight and that the latest inflation rate of 5.2%, which is the highest level for 15 years and three times the EU average, is threatening the stability of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and is impacting most severely on the most vulnerable people in society particularly pensioners and those on fixed income;</P>
    <P>aware that if current trends continue, the average peak hour travel speeds in the Dublin area will fall from 14 km per hour now to just 8 km per hour by 2016 which will result in huge economic, social and environmental costs; and that demand for public transport will increase by 450% over the same period;</P>
    <P>noting that in the absence of any coherent spatial planning, house prices have risen by 70% over the last three years, putting home ownership beyond the reach of most first time buyers, and that during the same period rents have doubled and local authority housing lists have increased by 40%;</P>
    <P>conscious that since this Government took office there is a deepening crisis in the health services, evidenced by an increase of 18% in hospital waiting lists, the fact that over 14,000 adults and children have been waiting for over a year for a hospital bed, the shortage of nurses and doctors and industrial unrest and low morale among medical and paramedical staff;</P>
    <P>concerned about the rise in violent crime, with 30 deaths in the first half of the year, and the growing level of public disorder and attacks in public places;</P>
    <P>noting the fact that the Government has failed to produce a comprehensive child care package and has introduced tax policies that are divisive between families;</P>
    <P>noting that the Government's environmental policies are failing to deal with crucial issues such as waste disposal and Ireland's international obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions;</P>
    <P>aware that despite numerous promises, the Government has failed to publish new ethics legislation and the Taoiseach has been dilatory and evasive in dealing with problems concerning former Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy Denis Foley and Deputy John Ellis;</P>
    <P>recognising the widespread public outrage regarding the Government's decision to nominate Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the position of Vice President of the European Investment Bank, despite the acknowledgement by the Taoiseach that Mr. O'Flaherty has questions to answer in relation to his role in the Sheedy case;</P>
    <P>noting the recent public comments made by the Tánaiste which may have profoundly <Col N="171" /> damaging implications for a current criminal trial,</P>
    <P>condemns the Government's abject failure to adequately address any of the fundamental problems facing the country.</P>

      <P>The Dáil should not adjourn for a recess of three months on Friday because so much is happening. The revelations in the Moriarty tribunal today go to the very highest level in Government. There are political as well as legal issues of accountability to be resolved. While legal issues can be resolved in tribunals or courts, political issues can be resolved only here on the floor of Dáil Éireann. This House has its job to do, just as much as courts or tribunals have theirs.</P>
      <P>The Government has no right to send the Dáil on holiday and hope that current events will fade from public memory. This House has a right to sit and consider these issues. I call on the Taoiseach to revise the arrangements for the summer recess so that this House can meet. Office rebuilding does not prevent democracy from continuing. We can meet in this Chamber regardless of what may be going on in other parts of Leinster House.</P>
      <P>I will not spend long dealing with the situation of the Tánaiste in light of her damaging remarks that have led to the calling off of the criminal trial of former Deputy Charles Haughey for alleged obstruction of the work of a tribunal appointed by this House. The Tánaiste at all times speaks as a member of Government. If she makes a comment that has damaging effects she, as someone appointed by this House, must be accountable to this House. Today the Tánaiste seems to be hiding from this House and slipping furtively into Cabinet meetings to avoid the media.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made a grave political error, which is tragic for her. She has pursued the issue of accountability in politics with sincerity and consistency. Accountability has been one of the foundation concepts of her party. However, the Tánaiste must also be accountable to this House for her words and actions. Actions and words have consequences. That is what accountability is about. In regard to her damaging remarks, which were construed as being related to a current trial, the Tánaiste must now apply to herself the doctrine of accountability which she has so often applied to others, speaking from the seat now occupied by Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any other Minister had made an error that had the consequences the Tánaiste's error has had, he or she would have to be accountable. Press releases issued on her behalf outside the House do not suffice. If an error like this had <Col N="172" /> been made by any Minister when Deputy Harney was in Opposition, she would have been demanding that Minister's resignation, and she knows that well. She now seems to be a person of double standards.</P>
    <P>In the course of a radio interview this morning, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, said: &ldquo;This is a good Government.&rdquo;  It is not a good Government. It is not the sort of Government this country needs. A Government that breaches Cabinet procedures in making important appointments to a European post, appointing somebody whom it was willing to impeach only a year previously, is not a good Government. A Government that appointed Ray Burke as one of its members and then blamed the Opposition when he eventually had to resign is not a good Government. A Government that prevaricated over the positions of Deputies Foley and Ellis on committees for which they were wholly unsuitable is not a good Government. A Government that has inflation running at three times the EU average is not a good Government. A Government that has seen house prices increased by 70% since it came to office is not a good Government. A Government that has seen 4,000 child care places disappear without replacement is not a good Government. A Government that has 14,000 adults and children waiting over a year for a hospital bed is not a good Government.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of nurses and doctors in the health service. There is industrial unrest. Anaesthetists are now so scarce that epidurals for women delivering babies are only available on some days in certain maternity hospitals &ndash; the baby has to be born on a particular day of the week if the mother is to have the possibility of having the pain mitigated by an epidural. What sort of health service is this? What sort of country is this where that could happen, where such pain is inflicted?</P>
    <P>Many of these problems  &ndash; inflation, housing, health waiting lists, child care &ndash; have one thing in common, they are all evidence of a structural bottleneck in Irish society. There is insufficient supply of people to work, so inflation is increasing. There is insufficient supply of people to work in hospitals, so waiting lists are increasing. There is insufficient supply of serviced land for housing, so house prices are rising. There is insufficient supply of outlets for various retail products, so retail prices are rising and are far higher here than elsewhere in Europe. There is an insufficient supply of child care places, so parents and children are suffering. There is insufficient supply of public transport and road space for cars, so traffic jams are getting worse. Structural problems such as these can be resolved only by structural reform. Structural reform is needed, but a Government that is looking over its shoulder all the time at tribunals, or whose members are looking suspiciously across the table at one another, is not the sort of Government a country in need of structural reform needs to have in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> An early general election would be in the best interests of the country. I say that because we simply cannot go on the way we are going now. It is too much for the public to bear. We need to clear away the agenda of sleaze and get on with the business of government, and only a new Government can do that. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste, Deputies Bertie Ahern and Mary Harney, have nothing more to offer. They should go, and go quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the arrogance of the Government that when the leader of the Opposition is leading off in this debate it has not fielded a single Cabinet Minister to sit on the Government benches. If this House were a court, the Government would be in the dock charged with criminal negligence. When it came to office three years ago, it took over an economy which was thriving. All economic indicators were pointing upwards. The budget was going into surplus, economic growth was unprecedented and the rainbow Government had negotiated the highly successful Partnership 2000. Ireland's inflation was the lowest in Europe. The economy continued to prosper in the early years of this Administration, not because of any proactive Government policies but because, as inheritors of office, the Government benefited from the successful policies of its predecessors. That has now changed.</P>
      <P>An inappropriate fiscal policy is threatening our prosperity. The canker of inflation is threatening the rose of growth and while the Minister for Finance, like King Canute, commands the rising tide to stop, the Tánaiste, in an excursion into the past, draws on the failed policies of yesteryear and seeks to keep down prices by order.</P>
      <P>Inflation makes people poorer. A person's income buys less and people on fixed incomes such as pensioners and those on social welfare payments slide further into poverty when prices rise. This year's budget increased social welfare payments by 5%, but this is now completely eroded by rising prices. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed a wage rise this year of 5.5%. This year's inflation, estimated by the ESRI to reach 5.8%, completely erodes this increase.</P>
      <P>Inflation is not just a threat to personal living standards, however. People have no desire to become poor and will always seek to regain the ground lost to inflation. That is why the PPF, designed to last for three years, is already redundant after three months. This incompetent Government, by its failure to tackle inflation, has undermined its own wage agreement. It will not be able to hold the pay line, and wage demands geared to win back the ground lost to inflation will undermine the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our prosperity has been export led. Competitiveness is the main ingredient of Ireland's growth and if it is eroded the virtuous circle which takes us forward will become the vicious circle that <Col N="174" /> winds our economy down. Just as Nero fiddled while Rome burned, the Minister for Finance fiddles while his forecasts are overtaken by the rising tide of inflation, and the economic policy of the Government and the prosperity of the country disintegrates.</P>
    <P>The last budget was the wrong budget at the wrong time. The stimulatory effect of the budget announced on budget day was fanned by the second and third budgetary announcements forced on the Minister for Finance by his own backbenchers and the social partners. The budget, together with the unprecedented expansion of credit, has pushed the economy forward at an unprecedented pace and inflationary pressures are now threatening prosperity. The Minister for Finance ignored the advice of the Opposition, the NESC and independent commentators when he decided to give the most significant tax relief to persons who are already well off and to give very moderate tax relief to persons on low and middle income. If extra consumer spending is given to the well off, it fuels a consumer boom, if given to the poor, it goes on the necessities of life to lift people out of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance ignores advice. He is self-willed beyond belief and his arrogance will be his downfall. Mr. Churchill once complimented the pilots who won the Battle of Britain by saying: &ldquo;Never had so much been done for so many by so few.&rdquo;  We could parody these words and apply them to the Minister for Finance on budget day &ndash; never had so little been done for so many by a Minister with so much, with such disastrous consequences. One example tells the story. If instead of introducing his much vaunted individualisation of income tax the Minister had increased the range of the standard rate band and doubled it in the traditional manner for married persons, his income tax package would have cost an additional £130 million. However, his compensationary measure actually cost £125 million, resulting in virtually no savings. It is not a question of the Government having wrong policies, it has been quite clear in recent months that it has no policies at all and that the Minister for Finance is willing to allow the ship of State to be blown hither and thither by the winds of market forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is an advocate of the free market. After years of intervention in the economy by various Administrations, the Minister is willing to allow the market to decide on most issues. Free market economics is now the norm. We would have to go back to the end of the last century to find a situation where practically all countries in the world followed variations of free market economics and were wedded to capitalism. There is no doubt that when the Berlin Wall fell it was not so much the triumph of democracy but the triumph of capitalism. A free market and capitalism are now also the accepted ideologies in Ireland and worldwide.</P>
    <P>Despite our prosperity, the free market and Fianna Fáil's eventual embrace of capitalism, prosperity is not available to very many people <Col N="175" /> and many people are profoundly unhappy. They are not sharing in the Celtic tiger. Reductions in capital gains tax to 20% or a commitment to a standard rate of corporation tax of 12.5% touches neither the lives nor imaginations of most ordinary people. Ireland needs a new social contract, a commitment that all will share in the current prosperity, not only through increased wages and reduced taxes but also in the availability of proper public services. The people need and expect a health service where people do not die on waiting lists or where patients wait all night in casualty for attention. The people need and expect an education service which eliminates the disgrace of one in seven of our people not properly learning to read or write. They need and expect that they and their sons and daughters can live in affordable homes which they own and that, now that we have the resources, the infrastructure of a modern economy will be provided, the traffic chaos will be relieved, the environment will be preserved and the stress is taken out of daily living by a competent Government using the resources available to provide essential services.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary events of recent weeks have demonstrated conclusively that it is time this rotten Government left office. Across a broad range of fronts it is in total disarray. It is permanently engaged in fire brigade politics, constantly trying to douse daily brush fires of political corruption, half truths and incompetence which are revealed.</P>
      <P>The public rightly want something that should be simple and straightforward, decent standards in politics and the exposure and criminal prosecution of those accused of wrongdoing. Instead of rescuing politics from the mire into which it descended under the leadership of Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have further debased politics by a mixture of foolishness and old-fashioned, discredited, Fianna Fáil cuteness.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's professed commitment to ethics in politics has no credibility in the context of his party continuing to be propped up in Government by the votes in the House of Deputies who have resigned from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party under a cloud of financial impropriety. The Taoiseach's many public commitments to fully co-operate with the Moriarty and Flood tribunals and to furnish to them all documentation and information of relevance under the control of the Fianna Fáil Party or of which he is aware is totally discredited by today's events at the Moriarty tribunal. The Taoiseach's and the Tánaiste's previous commitments to a new transparency and accountability in public life are totally undermined by their nomination and support for Hugh O'Flaherty's appointment to the European Investment Bank while he refuses to comprehensively explain to a committee of the House his role in the Sheedy affair.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste's continued support for the Taoiseach after today's events in the Moriarty tribunal will, in the eyes of the general public, finally demolish the claim by the Progressive Democrats to be the public's moral conscience in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the lifetime of the Government we have had two different Ministers for Health and Children. Despite the differences in style, both have proved themselves totally incapable of properly managing our health services. Crisis management and fire brigade style interventions when emergencies regularly arise due to a lack of adequate planning are daily features of our health service. Thousands of patients have been left languishing on hospital waiting lists and have totally lost confidence in our health services. Some have been on waiting lists during the entire three year lifetime of the Government. Thousands of children have been waiting years on orthodontic waiting lists for essential dental care, with no <Col N="177" /> possibility of it being provided in the foreseeable future. More than 1,000 children reported to health boards as at risk of child abuse remain at risk due to a lack of staff and resources to provide essential protection. Many women giving birth in our maternity hospitals are deprived of epidural services due to a shortage of anaesthetists. Elderly patients wait for days on trolleys in accident and emergency units of our hospitals because there are no hospital beds available for them. Due to medical and nursing shortages planned operations are regularly postponed and operating theatres are underutilised.</P>
    <P>The Government's confrontational style of industrial relations has resulted in an unprecedented number of industrial disputes in our health services and the first ever nurses' strike. The Government's failure to address the very real concerns of junior doctors not only resulted in unnecessary confrontation but also in many junior doctors taking up employment outside the State and has directly contributed to essential medical posts within our hospitals remaining unfilled.</P>
    <P>While professing a commitment to reduce smoking related diseases, the Government refuses to make nicotine replacement therapy available to medical card holders or to provide for it under the drug payment scheme. Despite a public outcry, the promised inquiry into the removal and retention of children's organs has still not commenced due to the Government's failure to properly address the concerns of bereaved parents.</P>
    <P>In short, in three years in office the Government has failed to put patients first and properly implement any element of health or child care policy. Its talk of upholding ethics in politics has not been matched by the behaviour of members of Fianna Fáil. I spoke to many members of Fianna Fáil when canvassing in Tipperary and they are sickened by the daily revelations and scandals, and will be further sickened by today's events. The people deserve better. The result of the Tipperary South by-election conclusively confirms that the Government has lost the support of a majority of the electorate. It is time for it to go.</P>

      <P>History will not be kind to Fianna Fáil, particularly on its actions since the 1980s. It would make very poor material for a marriage bureau. For whatever reason, Fianna Fáil seems to have a batchelor mentality in its dealings with its junior coalition partner, with which it always finds itself at loggerheads. Mr. Haughey viewed the Progressive Democrats with contempt. Deputy Albert Reynolds said they were only a &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; and also tried to undermine the Labour Party. It is hard to know what the Taoiseach is up to, but it looks as if there is to be another purge of Fianna Fáil's junior coalition partner. The question that many people are asking is why should this happen only to Fianna Fáil Taoisigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has a record of which it cannot be proud. It does not want to share power or secrets <Col N="178" /> at the Cabinet table and it seems it will always engineer ways and means that will eventually lead to its junior coalition partner either pulling out or being shoved out for a variety of reasons. It does not have the mentality or capability to enter or remain in government with anybody else. Single party rule always suited it. Now that the public knows what it did, it will be a long time before it is in that position again.</P>
    <P>The consequence of this is in-fighting in the Government and once this starts it is on autopilot. It will not take the proper decisions and will not see the wood for the trees. There will be no planning for the future. On his taxation onslaught in the budget on married women working in the home, were it not for the fact that the Minister for Finance had so much money available to him he would have started World War III &ndash; he has started several since.</P>
    <P>The economy is strong in spite of the Government. Any planning for the future has been short-changed because the Government is transfixed by tribunals, court cases and internal bickering. The sooner it goes, the better for the people. This is in sharp contrast to the Government led by Deputy John Bruton. Everyone said that it would not stay together, but its members were as friendly on the last day as on the first. That is something the last three Fianna Fáil Taoisigh will never be able to say.</P>

      <P>Since coming to office the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has presided over the worst housing crisis in the history of the State. Three years into the life of the Dáil and following a succession of failed Government initiatives to curb house price inflation, it is now accepted that the housing crisis is the Government's Achilles heel. The quarterly housing statistics bulletin published yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, highlighted further the extent of the problem affecting first-time buyers and those who have been squeezed out of the housing market. The Minister of State had the brass neck to take some comfort from the fact that house prices in the Dublin area seem to have moderated in the first four months of the year. He told us, &ldquo;The reversal of house price inflationary trends was most welcome and was clear evidence that the Government's actions were contributing to increasing stabilisation in the market.&rdquo;  It now costs over £160,000 to purchase a new house in the Dublin market and in excess of £126,000 nationwide. This, in effect, excludes every person in the State on average income who aspires to purchase his or her own home. For the Minister of State and his colleagues to make congratulatory statements about the impact of their policy to date is a cruel joke on the hundreds of thousands desperately in need of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The situation in respect of those who require social housing has deteriorated rapidly since the Government came to office. In three years we have seen a doubling of the number of applicants who require local authority housing. It is estimated that more than 130,000 men, women and children are looking for housing from their respective local authorities. Ireland was once proud of the fact that a significant percentage of our housing output was for low-income families who could not afford to purchase a house in the private market. Under the Government that proud record has been tarnished. The reality of three generations of one family living in an overcrowded house is now commonplace in council or corporation estates. The Government's response is a disjointed and ineffective plan to throw money at the problem without delivering additional housing units at affordable prices to couples on low and average incomes. I have said to the Minister of State on numerous occasions that if he has no faith in the ability of some local authorities to build local authority houses, he should take over their building programmes. Attempting to shed the blame for the crisis in the local authority sector is his last desperate bid.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the third Bacon report will drive up rents in the private rental sector. This will be felt most by those on fixed incomes and, in particular, by the elderly, students and returned emigrants who require temporary accommodation. The Government's response to the latest Bacon report which will, in effect, push tenants out of the private rental sector makes little sense when an expansion of the sector is required. The tax package before the House will have a significant inflationary impact on the economy at a time when the Government has failed to provide modern legislation to protect tenants and update tenancy agreements. It has failed to produce significant results in its three years in office.</P>
    <P>Unlike Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael believes that the housing crisis can be solved. That is the reason we have outlined in our proposals to date a comprehensive national housing strategy, which would free up land for the housing market, introduce international tendering for housing developments, designate new centres for rapid expansion of housing output, provide community facilities at the first stage of new housing developments, deliver on our commitments to increase the number of social housing units for those squeezed out of the market, introduce consumer protection legislation to the housing market and provide for fair rents and expansion of the private rental sector. The housing crisis can be resolved as soon as the Government leaves office. The future prosperity of the country is dependent upon politics delivering affordable houses for an expanding labour force. Unlike Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, we will take responsibility for our actions and we will deliver results.</P>

      <P>The Government has failed to understand or deal with the child care crisis. This is exposed this evening when it announced an investment of just £40 million in child care. In 1999, it was estimated that investment in excess of £200 million was necessary. However, because of the vastly deteriorating situation, that figure is nearer £300 million. In this context, an investment of £40 million will go only a little way towards tackling the crisis.</P>
      <P>It is also a disgrace that the Government has failed to publish the review of the report prepared by the Partnership 2000 expert group on child care. The report, published in January 1999, was followed by the appointment of a review group which was given six months to set out the practical implications of its recommendations in policy terms for the Government. Ten months after the deadline the Government's silence is deafening.</P>
      <P>The Government's foot dragging, squabbling and inertia in decision-making has helped prolong the child care crisis. Thousands of working parents with young children have been left high and dry. Nothing short of emergency measures are needed to radically tackle this issue. A staggering 4,000 child care places have been lost since the introduction of regulations under the Child Care Act, 1996. Such a loss is an immediate cause of concern. Child care is needed by many families today. That includes full-time and part-time working parents and parents who work exclusively in the home.</P>
      <P>Under this Government Ireland has become an increasingly stressful place in which to raise children. Every family faces growing pressure. From the moment a child is born, its day and that of its parents is filled with a series of stresses arising from the increasingly difficult living conditions that have become the norm. Under the Government, children as much as adults must cope with broken footpaths and inadequate public transport services. They journey to school by car because their parents do not trust the public transport system. This aggravates traffic congestion. They play in public parks that are fouled by dogs against whose owners the law is not enforced. They are afraid to take bicycles onto the road because of the lack of cycle lanes and poor road maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where both parents of a child must work outside the home &ndash; 42% of younger mothers are in employment &ndash; the stress of raising a child begins within weeks of birth, as soon as maternity or paternity leave ends. The Government has failed to introduce local authority planning guidelines which would facilitate the provision of child care in residential areas. It has also failed to respond to the proposal by Fine Gael to increase child care benefit for children under the age of five to £25 per week. Not only do children deserve it, but it is fair to all children because it guarantees that all children are treated equally, whether they are in receipt of child care or are being looked after at home by a parent, grandparent or other rela<Col N="181" /> tive. Paid child care should not be a privilege over unpaid child care or <i>vice versa.</i> The choice should be for each family. The Government has failed totally on this issue and its proposal this evening is pathetic.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see a second member of the Government arriving for this debate. I regret the absence of the rest of the Government. It shows the same contempt for Parliament as it has shown to the public.</P>
      <P>In the past five years this society has undergone the kind of change that would normally occur in 50 years. In such circumstances strong Government and leadership is needed. The public has looked to politicians and, in normal circumstances, could expect from Government the kind of direction that is needed. However, it is not getting it from this Government and has not got it since it took office. The Government has been riven with division, suspicion and allegation. When it is not reacting to and putting a spin on breaking scandals from without, it is watching its back from within.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Government has displayed no vision and no view of what society wants. There has been no leadership, no direction and no view of what we should do with our new found wealth or how we should channel prosperity to benefit all our citizens. How can there be when the Government spends its time looking over its shoulder? When it makes decisions it is held to ransom and forced to reverse them by the demands of Independent Deputies on whom it is dependent.</P>
      <P>At a time of rapid change we need decisions about major issues. There should not merely be concern with how we sustain growth levels and respond to the barriers and constraints that will normally emerge in an economy at a time like this, we also need decisions on how, as individuals and a society, we adjust to the phenomenal changes that are occurring.</P>
      <P>People have seen higher incomes but they are not seeing a better quality of life. No wonder the public is cynical and no wonder it regards politicians as irrelevant when it sees a Government with its coffers overflowing with money but paralysed on all the issues that impact on the quality of life. There have been many reports on housing, yet young people see their chance of owning their own home becoming ever more unlikely. Those who are lucky enough to buy are travelling distances that are untenable. What is that doing to their quality of life, to their children and to the environment?</P>
      <P>My colleague issued a statement today about the thousands of child care places that have been lost. It is not just the physical care for children that is at issue. How do we nurture children in this new society? Has the Government any ideas in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the crime figures, our sons and daughters cannot walk safely on the streets of the so-called entertainment capital of Europe, nor <Col N="182" /> can visitors. This is the Government that was to give us zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>Waste management is another issue of vital importance at a time of change when the economy and the population is expanding. The Government has given no leadership on this issue. As with all hard decisions that must be made, the Government has walked away.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly spoken about the traffic issue in this House. The Government appears to have no view on the issue and appears to regard it as a joke that people should be concerned about it. Traffic is a fundamental quality of life issue for the vast majority of citizens. It is destroying our quality of life and is causing stress beyond belief for families who are wasting hours of their days. Every simple job is made more difficult. In the next 15 years &ndash; most of the change will take place in the next five years &ndash; peak hour traffic journeys will increase from 250,000 to 500,000 per day. This will require a 450% increase in the level of public transport. Nothing is being done to prepare for that. Given this, the forecast increase in the number of peak hour journeys will never materialise because people will make other decisions. Investors will move elsewhere and jobs will be lost. Nobody will have work to travel to unless the Government makes changes now.</P>
    <P>Every now and then the Government has a rush of blood to the head and makes a decision, like it did last November on the issuing of taxi licences for Dublin when it proposed to solve all problems overnight. The end result of that short-term gimmick to get publicity in the run-up to Christmas is that not a single taxi licence has been issued. It ended up in the courts on the basis that it was an anti-competitive move. Anybody could have told the Government in advance that its proposal had already been looked at and rejected. On all these issues and on the many I have been unable to speak about, the Government is out of touch because its energies are totally consumed with fighting a rearguard action to stay in office for even one more day.</P>

      <P>To listen to some of the Opposition, one would think one was living somewhere else. The Fine Gael motion talks about abysmal &ldquo;failure to adequately address any of the fundamental problems facing the country&rdquo;, but nowhere was that more characterised under the previous Administration than regarding Northern Ireland policy, particularly the policy pursued by the then Taoiseach, the person who puts himself forward as a putative Taoiseach for the future, Deputy John Bruton.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came to office, bringing a just and lasting peace to all the people of this island has been our highest priority. Our record and our achievements in this regard stand for themselves. We have overseen truly momentous developments, bringing the vision of an Ireland in which all its people and its traditions are united in partnership and peace, of which others have spoken, closer than at any time in our history. From the work of our very early days in office to the unprecedented developments that have taken place this week, the Government has dedicated itself to advancing the peace process and achieving the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the democratic will of the people of Ireland. Peace, for too long an unrealised dream, has become an everyday reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been an easy journey, but we have come a long way and we have further to go. When we took office in June 1997, the IRA ceasefire <Col N="185" /> had broken down and the future of the peace process was uncertain. Through skilful and painstaking work, we secured the restoration of the ceasefire, putting us back on track for the substantive multi-party talks which began in Belfast in September 1997. The Government, under the visionary leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, played a central and vital role in the long and difficult negotiations that led to the tragedies of the past being left behind us. A chance to build together a future in tolerance and mutual respect, where we can all pursue our legitimate political aspirations through peaceful and democratic means, is a legacy of which the Government is proud.</P>
    <P>The Agreement was endorsed by all the people of Ireland, North and South, in the referendums of May 1998. In voting for it in such overwhelming numbers, the people made it their own. In the period since, we have never stinted in our efforts to deliver to them the realisation of all that the Agreement promised. We are close to achieving that goal.</P>
    <P>We have overseen historic constitutional change. The new text of Article 2 of the Constitution has given a modern expression to our most basic and enduring values, defining the Irish nation in the most open, inclusive and non-coercive manner, entitling all the people born on the island of Ireland to citizenship on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>We removed for ever any notion that the Irish people do not wish to see unity by consent of the people, North and South. It can only be achieved peacefully and democratically.</P>
    <P>These changes have, of course, been matched by changes in British constitutional legislation which also enshrine consent and, for the first time, now have a clear mechanism to give effect to any majority wish for a united Ireland in the future. We have also overseen the creation of a new set of institutions to reflect the new beginning to relationships on these islands promised by the Agreement.</P>
    <P>For those who have watched the conduct of Northern politics down the years, the low-key, professional and businesslike approach of the Executive and the Assembly have been a revelation. The Executive, under the joint stewardship of David Trimble and Séamus Mallon, has succeeded in demonstrating fully that the values underpinning the Agreement &ndash; partnership, mutual respect and equality &ndash; can be brought to bear in a meaningful and practical way for the benefit of Nationalists and Unionists. The long-awaited real politics has begun with local and locally accountable Ministers taking decisions on matters of importance and significance in the lives of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Assembly has been working well. Like any other elected body, it has seen its share of robust debate, but I have been deeply impressed by the manner in which parliamentarians from all perspectives and backgrounds have been approaching their work with diligence, commitment and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> As a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government, I take particular pride in the role we have played in developing mutual understanding and reconciliation and in broadening and deepening co-operative connections between both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council has brought that work to a new plane. The fact that Ministers from both jurisdictions have been meeting regularly and frequently to the point where such meetings have become almost unremarkable is, in itself, an astounding example of the progress which has been made under this Government and no other in ensuring that those institutions were set up, accounted for and agreed by all.</P>
    <P>The implementation bodies are up and running. The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference are carrying forward the substantial programmes of work they have identified for themselves. We have transformed that political landscape in which we, as a Government, operate. Our journey has not always been smooth, and we have encountered many obstacles and overcome many setbacks.</P>
    <P>No one issue has proved more difficult to resolve than the question of arms. As Deputies will be aware, the key to this issue, on both sides, has been trust that the institutions will be operated in good faith, and confidence that the question of arms will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>When I took up office earlier this year, the narrow ground of decommissioning and devolution, the ground Deputy Bruton likes to plough day in and day out, had been ploughed and ploughed again, but had failed to yield the progress we needed to secure. It was my belief then, as it is now, that the only way in which the objectives of all sides can be achieved is by broadening the debate to encompass the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement and not being afraid to say so.</P>
    <P>That is the view that we took in our discussions with the British Government and with the parties which concluded successfully with the restoration of the Executive and the Assembly at the end of last month. In our statement with the British Government of 5 May and in our letter to the parties we set out how and when outstanding aspects of the Agreement for which we have responsibility will be taken forward. We called on others to make their intentions clear, and the IRA responded in its statement of 6 May, setting out the context in which it will put its arms permanently and verifiably beyond use and putting in place the confidence building measure which was delivered this week.</P>
    <P>The report of the two independent inspectors, President Maarti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, that they have inspected a number of IRA dumps and that the weapons contained in them are secure is without historic precedent. Together with the IRA's announcement that it has re-engaged with the de Chastelain Commission, it makes a significant contribution to building and sustaining confidence that all commitments will <Col N="187" /> be honoured and all aspects of the Agreement will be implemented. I have said on many occasions that I want to see decommissioning happen as soon as possible, but I have also frequently observed that it is a voluntary act and will only be achieved on that basis.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, the developments of recent days represent an extremely significant movement forward in the consolidation of peace and political accommodation and present us with a bridge to the achievement of full implementation of the Agreement. We have made remarkable progress since taking office and the Government puts that record before the people proudly and without equivocation. We are not complacent, nor can we afford to be because difficult issues exist which still need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work to achieve a representative, accountable and effective police service in Northern Ireland. In this regard, the House will be aware of the intensive work in which we have been engaged to ensure that the legislation before the Parliament at Westminster remains true to the report brought forward by the Patten Commission.</P>
    <P>In other areas of foreign policy we are fully committed to our campaign for non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the two year term 2001-02. We have just successfully concluded a six month term as Chair of the Committee of Ministers which I shared with my predecessor, Deputy Andrews. We have achieved an excellent initiative launched by my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, in the area of nuclear disarmament which has gone unnoticed in this House and elsewhere. We achieved outstanding success at the recent Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference in New York. The proposals of the New Agenda Coalition, in which Ireland has been playing a lead role, not only secured widespread support but became the basis of the agreed final declaration of the conference. For the first time, the nuclear weapons states have made an explicit commitment to nuclear disarmament and have accepted a programme in this regard. That is a major achievement for Irish diplomacy.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to work in support of international peace and security has also been fully reflected in our approach to European security and defence which has been characterised by dynamism, direction and decisiveness. The Government ensured that an Irish contingent would play an active part in the peacekeeping operation authorised by the UN after the Kosovo war and we did that quickly and without hesitation. The approach the Government has taken in the EU debate on a common foreign security and defence policy is that the European Union is developing a defence role, but not in mutual defence. Some people in the House continually try to portray their defence of Irish interests as trying to avoid a mutual defence role for Ireland in the European Union. It is not on the agenda. <Col N="188" /> We are talking about developing a role in peacekeeping and crisis management consistent with the Petersberg Tasks and Irish foreign policy traditions of successive Governments. It is time the nonsense from those people in the House ended.</P>
    <P>There are areas of activity concerning the intergovernmental conference which we discussed in an earlier debate and we will refer to them in greater detail again. We will always see the prospect of enhanced co-operation as something which requires greater clarity as to the areas where it might apply because we want to see adequate safeguards in place to ensure and protect the achievements of the Union, such as the Single Market and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We have outlined in detail our negotiating position on those matters and we are prepared to negotiate confidently on those.</P>
    <P>Development aid is also a responsibility of my Department and we are putting to Government for consideration ways and means by which we can meet in coming years the UN proposed target for development aid of 0.7% of GNP. That is something the Government will seek to address. On international trade and widening our diplomatic remit, given recent announcements in Norway and Asia, we have seen the implementation of far-sighted policies which will bring great benefits to our country in terms of international trade and, more importantly, our political position in the world.</P>
    <P>We are pursuing our objectives regarding Northern Ireland and the European Union agenda in a clear, unambiguous and consistent way and we make no apology to anyone for doing so. Regardless of the difficulties, we are obtaining results which confirm progress in policy areas which are complex. There is no complacency on our part regarding the continuing issues of concern and we will continue to contribute positively so that real change for the better occurs consistent with the interests of our people. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

Tá an tír seo athraithe agus feabhsaithe, agus tá sé réidh don mílaois nua. These were three short years where peace was restored and reinforced, where prosperity surged and unemployment and crime tumbled, where the lives of countless thousands of Irish men, women and children were improved.

I wish to address the issues of health and education which <Col N="189" /> have been raised by the Opposition. Before June 1997, no fiscal crisis existed, but we had a Government which froze school funding and wanted to cut back teacher numbers. We had a Government which spent £250,000 going to the Supreme Court in an attempt to deny a child special education supports. We had a Government which wanted to spend £40 million on a bureaucracy to extend State control of schools at the same time that these controls were being abandoned by the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>After three years, the people have seen what can come from a Government which has a real commitment to education. The Government has put in place the largest concentrated programme in the history of the State to modernise education, increased direct funding of schools by almost two thirds, is hiring 2,500 new teachers and has reduced primary class sizes to their lowest ever level. The schools information technology programme, IT 2000, is one of the largest initiatives of its type in the world and, such is its success, each of the specific three year targets for the first phase were met or exceeded after only two years. The second phase of this programme was launched in November 1999 and funded to the extent of £81 million.</P>
    <P>Our aim is the elimination of educational disadvantage. Last December £194 million was allocated specifically for that purpose. The New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity involves every level of the educational system, including pre-schools, adult literacy and Traveller education. The plan provides funding for a complete revision of targeted disadvantage funding for schools. This plan represents social inclusion in action. In addition to continuing support for primary schools already designated as disadvantaged, a comprehensive survey is being carried out on every primary school in the country to identify levels of educational disadvantage. With the results in hand, we will, from September 2000, deliver a new targeted support package to disadvantaged primary pupils.</P>
    <P>Pupils at risk of dropping out of school, who are often condemned to cycles of disadvantage thereafter, have been targeted for special attention by this Government We have continued to provide funding for a series of initiatives to identify those children aged between eight and 15 who are at risk of dropping out. The Education (Welfare) Bill marks a radical change in school attendance legislation and will ensure a nationally and locally co-ordinated approach to school attendance. Exam fees for all families who hold a medical card have been abolished. Youthreach and Traveller training courses targeted at 15 to 18 year old early school leavers have been expanded, and counselling, guidance and child care services have been introduced for these programmes.</P>
    <P>We also aim for a health system of the highest quality which is accessible to the poorest of our citizens without undue delay or inconvenience. Waiting lists are being reduced. The figures for <Col N="190" /> the first quarter in 2000 indicate a reduction of almost 2,500. A month ago I launched a £10 million plan to reduce them further. This money will enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed by the end of the year. Following detailed discussions with health agency chief executive officers, we have agreed another series of measures to reduce the waiting lists further. In addition, a review of bed capacity in the acute and non-acute hospital sector is under way which will enable a more informed approach to be taken to address infrastructural issues which may impinge on the ability of hospitals to achieve target average waiting times. That review is actively under way and will produce results quickly.</P>
    <P>However, problems exist in our health service and, while we do not attempt to deny it, unlike the Opposition we are not trying to sell the false promise of easy answers. We are providing funding, reforming service provision and radically expanding services for key groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities. There are problems with staffing and we are striving to solve them. We are working with health professionals to build a new approach to manpower relations within the sector. Unlike the Opposition when it was in Government, we are trying to find long-term solutions to long-term problems.</P>
    <P>The Government has increased total health spending by 58% in only three years and increased the capital allocation to health by 35% this year alone. It is investing £2 billion under the national development plan. That is a trebling of funding, an unprecedented investment, the thrust of which is the creation of an infrastructure which will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering more patient-centred and accessible services.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, for the significant advance in investment in health that was realised during his tenure in office. That will have a lasting impact on the quality of our health infrastructure and will lead to the development of a modern service.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the Government puts the patient first. It focuses on individuals, not systems, on preventative care, not disease management, on a seamless and unified, as opposed to a fragmented, service.</P>
    <P>Three years into the life of this Government we have much to be proud of. It is a Government which is delivering on the policies that matter to the people, the building of a lasting peace, the ending of mass emigration and unemployment. Our success in reducing unemployment has been staggering over the past three years and has been deliberately underestimated by the Opposition. The era of long-term unemployment has been almost eradicated. That issue dogged the rainbow Government and it did not succeed in tackling it in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Every section of society has received significant increases in income, whether in the workforce or <Col N="191" /> out of it. The last Government's inaction and complacency in housing, public transport, education and health have been replaced. There has been significant reform of the taxation system and a comprehensive programme of legislation which has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the quality of people's lives. The fact that the public have consistently refused to be fooled by the empty promises and shallow rhetoric of the Opposition shows the basic fact that they recognise the progress which has been made on these and many other issues.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House condemns the Government's failure to adequately address any of the fundamental problems facing the State. The last two weeks have not been good for the Government and it is understandable that an Opposition party would try to capitalise on that. If one looks at the overall performance of the Government since it entered office three years ago, however, there are many fine achievements. Many of the fundamental problems facing the State, the issues dominating the last general election campaign, have been dealt with by the Government in an efficient manner. We can be proud of the achievements of the past three years.</P>
      <P>What looked like a dream in Northern Ireland three years ago has become a reality. Within a few weeks of taking office, the ceasefire was restored. The Good Friday Agreement was signed and is now being implemented. The announcement yesterday of a breakthrough in the arms issue offers an opportunity for real peace.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland has been the single biggest problem for any Government to deal with for the past 30 years, and Fianna Fáil is the only party with credibility in this area. We have an understanding of the issue which was fundamental to the change that has taken place and we played a major part in the success that has been achieved. The Minister for Foreign Affairs reminded us earlier that it is not over and there are many hurdles remaining, but we are on the path to peace and success awaits us all.</P>
      <P>There has been a wonderful change in the employment situation. The number of people unemployed has fallen from 10% to 5%. There are those who do not like to give the Government credit for that, but in the past we were blamed when high unemployment figures prevailed. Every week 1,000 people return to the State to take up employment &ndash; that is the biggest vote of confidence people can give a Government &ndash; and the indications are that this trend will continue for some time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> In Opposition, Fianna Fáil identified crime as a major issue. We drew up plans and policies to deal with the problem and at the first opportunity we delivered. We have implemented anti-crime measures which have succeeded in bringing about a 21% reduction in crime. We have increased the numbers in the Garda Síochána. The Government continues to provide funds for community groups and crime prevention projects which are a necessary part of tackling the causes of crime. Crime levels have fallen and Garda detection rates have risen.</P>
    <P>We promised tax cuts and we have delivered. In successive budgets, personal tax rates have been reduced. We have given significant increases to social welfare recipients and people's disposable income has increased. The vast majority of people have never had it so good. The standard of living and quality of life have improved considerably for us all.</P>
    <P>The motion before us is very critical of the manner in which the Government has dealt with Members who are involved in the tribunals. I was elected for the first time in 1989 and there were things I did not like about the goings on in my party. I took certain action on it. I tried to do what I thought was right and I will continue to do so. The tribunals taking place at present and the evidence they have been given have been very embarrassing for Fianna Fáil. We are not the only party that has been embarrassed but, unfortunately, former members of my party have been shown up in a very poor light. Thousands of ordinary members are sickened by what they have heard and read from the tribunals. It is obvious that some of the practices going on were despicable and we should let the tribunals deal with those involved. I have no intention of doing penance for the sins of former members of Fianna Fáil. No other member of the party should be asked to make that sacrifice. I am no saint and I have not seen too many haloes in this House since my election, but I have certain standards and I do not try to portray those standards as being higher than those in the Opposition parties. The vast majority of people elected to the House try their best and go about their duties in an honest and honourable way.</P>
    <P>The public have become very cynical about the political process and the revelations at the tribunals have only served to increase that cynicism. The public perception of politicians was never so poor. We all have a duty to restore confidence in the political process. It is obvious that the provision of a booming economy is not sufficient. I am convinced there is the will in the Fianna Fáil Party to restore that confidence and I look forward to playing my part in achieving that goal.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I am delighted to support the Government amendment. I ask Opposition Members to be more balanced. The duty of an Opposition is to pick holes in the performance of the Government, but any fair-minded person looking back over the past three years, particularly our success in Northern Ireland, would be <Col N="193" /> impressed. If we worked together more often we could achieve much more.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate how much work needs to be done to restore confidence in the political system. It is obvious from election turn-outs that people do not have the same trust in politicians. It is vital that confidence and trust is restored.</P>

      <P>I am replying to the Minister's contribution. Listening to his interventions and the contribution made by the Minister for Health and Children, one would think that the Government had won the last five by-elections. One would also think that the public is widely appreciative of the transformation to which the Ministers referred and that is why it came out in numbers to elect or re-elect Fianna Fáil candidates in the last five by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tempted to quote the famous German playwright, Bertolt Brecht, who, after the uprising of workers in the communist state of East Germany, suggested to the central committee of <Col N="194" /> the then communist party that it should pass a motion to the effect that the Government had lost confidence in the people. The unreality of the sentiments expressed by the two Ministers opposite is very reminiscent of that attitude, on a day when Deputy Healy was introduced to this House with an unprecedented electoral success behind him.</P>
    <P>Not since the last days of the Haughey Administration have we had a Government in such disarray. Not for years have we had a Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance who have displayed such arrogance and contempt for the Dáil and for public opinion. Rarely before have we had a Government so desperate to reach the refuge of a long summer recess. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats may well limp over the line on Friday, battered and bedraggled, looking like a group of out of condition athletes who have just run two marathons, but what is beyond doubt is that the days of this Government are well and truly numbered.</P>
    <P>The increasing sound of dissent from within, the queue of Fianna Fáil backbenchers willing to voice their opposition to the O'Flaherty appointment, the desperate attempts by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to blame each other for what the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, had the honesty to admit this morning was &ldquo;political patronage&rdquo;, and the spinning and counter-spinning on behalf of the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, each attempting to depict the others as being primarily responsible for this fiasco, these are the sounds which constitute the death rattle of the Government.</P>
    <P>Not only has the Government lost all honour and credibility, it has lost whatever little vigour and drive it might have possessed. While most of the time of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is being taken up in desperate efforts to keep their listing ship afloat, social and economic problems have been allowed to mount. Inflation is at its highest level for 15 years and has effectively cancelled out the benefit of the general social welfare increases granted in the budget and the pay element of the increases granted under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. People earning £40,000 per year cannot obtain a mortgage to buy a house in Dublin. There are more people than ever on local authority housing waiting lists. Hospital waiting lists have worsened since this Government was elected. The policy of zero tolerance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, produces nothing more than a hollow laugh from members of the public as gangland killers stalk the land and elderly people again live in terror of brutal attack in their homes.</P>
    <P>The O'Flaherty nomination and the Government's response to it has come to symbolise all that is worst about this administration &ndash; the lack of judgment, the arrogance, the refusal to accept that it can do any wrong, the refusal to take heed of public opinion, the refusal to answer to the <Col N="195" /> Dáil, the absence of any sense of solidarity between the two parties and the back-stabbing within and between the parties. The O'Flaherty affair has also galvanised public opinion and transformed a sense of doubt and unease about the Government into absolute distrust and contempt.</P>
    <P>This is why the standing of the two people most prominently identified with the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, is plummeting in the opinion polls and why electoral support for Fianna Fáil went into freefall in the Tipperary South by-election. The Government is long past its sell-by date. The longer it clings to power, the more the public will turn on it. The longer it refuses to accept the inevitable, the higher the electoral price Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will pay when they face the people.</P>
    <P>If anyone had any doubt that the Government was a failed political entity, these must surely have been dispelled by the extraordinary developments since the weekend. First, we had the astonishing case of the Tánaiste, the Deputy Taoiseach, the holder of a constitutionally recognised position, being publicly rebuked by a judge of the Circuit Court for reckless and irresponsible comments that led to the indefinite postponement of a case involving serious criminal charges against a former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, Charles Haughey. What made the offence even worse is that Deputy Harney made these comments and thus jeopardised the prospects of the trial going ahead simply to divert attention away from the political problems the Progressive Democrats were then experiencing.</P>
    <P>One does not need to be an expert in international politics to recognise that in virtually any other jurisdiction reckless and irresponsible comments that led to such an outcome would almost certainly have led to the immediate resignation of the Minister who made them and had that Minister not resigned he or she would have faced instant dismissal. If this were the old days and had a Fianna Fáil Minister in a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government made similar remarks with a similar outcome, it would not have been long before there was a procession of Progressive Democrats to the Taoiseach's office demanding resignation.</P>
    <P>According to the Progressive Democrat sense of values, the late Brian Lenihan's misjudged and unsuccessful telephone call to the then President and his befuddled handing of the controversy when it broke ten years later was a matter that demanded his resignation as Tánaiste and Minister. Today, however, reckless and irresponsible comments by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, which have seriously jeopardised the prospect of former Deputy Haughey ever standing trial are not even worthy of a public response from the Tánaiste or a statement to this House, not to mention a resignation from office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> The Taoiseach is not in a position to adopt a high moral stand on any issue. His own tawdry record as Taoiseach has left him without a moral leg to stand on. In his three years in office his response to virtually every controversy and question has been characterised by evasion, equivocation, half-truths, dodging and weaving and, in particular, a failure to be up-front and open with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On his first day in office, the Taoiseach showed gross misjudgment by appointing Ray Burke to the key position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. He continued to defend former Deputy Burke right up to his disgraced and discredited end. He forgot to tell the Tánaiste about his knowledge of the Rennicks donation to Mr. Burke. He could not remember his meetings with Mr. Gilmartin. He forgot about the cheques he signed that financed Mr. Haughey's lavish lifestyle and he misled the Dáil to cover up his own role as co-signatory of the cheques. He failed to disclose his representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about Philip Sheedy and he broke his promise to the Tánaiste that he would tell the Dáil about them. He failed to take any action when Deputy Foley went to him and told him he was to be called before the Moriarty Tribunal. He failed to take any action to investigate the unsavoury activities of many Fianna Fáil councillors on Dublin County Council until his hand was forced by the Dunlop confessions.</P>
    <P>The disclosures at the Moriarty Tribunal this morning create a new dimension of seriousness and raise the most serious questions about the Taoiseach's conduct in regard to the tribunals and his suitability to continue to act as Taoiseach. On 27 January 1999, the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that &ldquo;The work of the tribunals will continue to have my full support and co-operation and that of the Government. I believe and act on the principle that any tribunal of inquiry should be entitled to have all relevant information, documentation and co-operation from me.&rdquo;  On 9 February of this year, responding to a motion about Deputy Foley, the Taoiseach said &ldquo;I reminded him [Deputy Foley] that it was Fianna Fáil policy to co-operate fully with the tribunal. I told him that the co-operation was essential and that total and full disclosure was critical.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It now appears that the Taoiseach was not living up to his words. When the story broke last Thursday I called upon him to make a full public disclosure of the facts of this situation and said that unattributable briefings by anonymous party officials from Fianna Fáil were simply not adequate. True to character, the Taoiseach failed to make any comprehensive public response and sent his officials out to dismiss the story. True to form, another Fianna Fáil investigation has proved deeply inadequate. However, lawyers for the tribunal have said that Fianna Fáil withheld crucial information regarding the donation ahead of the media disclosure last week. The Taoiseach has been summoned to appear once again before <Col N="197" /> the tribunal later this week to account for this apparent withholding of information.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a more serious charge which could be made against any Member of this House than deliberately withholding information from a tribunal which the House established. For such a charge to be made against the Head of the Government who has sought to take personal credit for establishing the tribunals is doubly serious. I have no doubt the tribunal will deal with this matter in its own way but there is also a political dimension which cannot be left to the tribunal. That must be dealt with in the Dáil by the Taoiseach coming into the House to make a full and comprehensive statement on his knowledge of the donation from Mr. Kavanagh, what happened to it, when he first learned there was a problem about it, why he failed to determine the real size of the donation and why he failed to make the tribunal aware of these developments.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach cannot say this is simply a matter for the tribunal. For more than two years, he maintained he could not even ask his councillors on Dublin County Council about donations in regard to rezonings but that position changed very rapidly when Frank Dunlop burst the dam at the Flood tribunal. At that stage, the Taoiseach established his own internal Fianna Fáil inquiry under the chairmanship of Deputy Rory O'Hanlon. That committee subsequently published a report which was the subject of widespread discussion.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has recognised that there are political dimensions to some of these issues which are more appropriately dealt with in the Dáil. On 20 July last year, in the course of the Taoiseach's cross-examination, counsel for the tribunal stated &ldquo;I think the tribunal doesn't want to get involved in matters which should perhaps be discussed in the Dáil.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the principal characteristics of this Government is its contempt for the Dáil. Never was that more evident than last Wednesday when the Taoiseach sent the Minister for Finance into the House to answer questions about an interview which the Taoiseach had given and which Deputy McCreevy had not even heard. Some of the Minister's ministerial and backbench colleagues were shocked by his manner, attitude and demeanour last Wednesday. It would be the greatest outrage of all and the greatest possible insult to the Oireachtas if the Government were to seek the refuge of the summer recess without coming in here to deal with the two big issues about which the entire country is talking, namely the Tánaiste's comments which have jeopardised the Haughey trial and the shocking allegations which have been made involving the Taoiseach and the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The series of events over recent weeks which have caused this Government so many problems all flowed from the decision to nominate Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty as Vice-President of the European Investment Bank. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="198" /> O'Donnell, in a remarkably candid interview this morning, described that decision as having the capacity to poison everything it touched. Forty days on from that decision being taken, we have still not received an explanation why this Government believed the only person suitable for nomination to this key position was the man who, just 12 months earlier, had been forced out of the Supreme Court under the unprecedented threat of impeachment by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Six weeks on and in spite of all the political grief it has left in its wake, we are still not any clearer about why the original decision was made and why the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have insisted on persisting with it, in spite of huge hostility within their own parties and in spite of the strong opposition of the overwhelming majority of the public. The question members of the public are now asking is whether there is something in this affair, some link between the key figures, some missing bit about which we are not yet aware which makes those who made and supported the nomination feel so compelled to stick with it regardless of the consequences. We only know one thing, as evidenced this evening at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, namely that this Government is united on at least one issue &ndash; it is determined that we will not find out the answers to the questions we have posed.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason for the nomination, the result is a lame-duck Government led by a discredited Taoiseach and a damaged and demoralised Tánaiste. Only a general election can clear the air, re-establish the authority of the political system and give us a new Government with a fresh mandate capable of adequately dealing with the many problems facing the people.</P>

      <P>We are living in a time of plenty which offers an unprecedented opportunity to create a really excellent quality of life for all our people. Yet, daily life is being blighted by the series of unmet needs outlined in this Fine Gael motion, the need for a roof over one's head, the hope of treatment when one is sick or suffering, the expectation that one can afford to buy a bag of groceries, the care and security of young children and the care and security of older people. Addressing these needs is the task of a Government, particularly when that Government oversees the greatest budget surplus in the history of the State. At a time of such opportunity, we do not even need a great Government to get things right, a good Government would suffice. Tragically, we have a walking disaster of a Government which, riven by dissent, suspicion and sleaze, no longer has any cohesion. It does not have any vision or dynamic nor does it have the will to govern well, if at all. Its only will is to cling on desperately and grimly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are clinging together out of a fear of the electorate. The collapse of the vote in Tipperary-South frightened Fianna Fáil backbenchers so much <Col N="199" /> that they are now queuing up to condemn the O'Flaherty appointment. There is equal disarray and confusion on the PD side. The Tánaiste, who built her reputation as a champion of truth and accountability, has skulked off into the undergrowth. She has gone missing from this House now that she must take the flak rather than dole it out. The questions she must answer will persist. Her gaffe in regard to the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was unbelievable, her foolish comments about Mr. Charles Haughey were incredible but her current silence is most significant of all. She has made it clear that in her view sleaze and corruption belong to another era. Now that the Moriarty tribunal lawyers are recalling the Taoiseach this Friday due to the alleged concealment by Fianna Fáil of major financial dealings, the Tánaiste has nothing to say. Her silence is telling. It tells the story of a Government which has lost all credibility and all sense of purpose or direction, save the purpose of hanging on at all costs.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, as we speak, emergency units in our hospitals are preparing to close. A real and urgent crisis is arising due to a lack of medical manpower. When Ministers are so concerned about saving their own skins, they have little energy left to concern themselves with saving others. The sick, poor and elderly are suffering and dying not because they must and not because we cannot afford to save them but because the Government has lost its way in the mire.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Health and Children claiming all manner of triumphs for the Government. He did not tell the truth about the waiting lists. Our waiting lists are worse now than when the Government took office. We have seen this Government preside over a nurses' strike for the first time ever. We have a shortage of junior hospital doctors who are the mainstay of our hospitals. Incredibly, we have a measles epidemic which has already taken the lives of two children. That is inexcusable in a developed country. We should have been able to eliminate measles but, due to neglect and the failure to face the reality of what it is like to be sick in this country, children are dying from a Third World disease which Third World countries are managing to control and reduce.</P>
    <P>While this Government attempts to evade and distort the truth and spread the blame, the Labour Party is producing the goods. We are facing up to the challenges in our communities, how to house our people, how to meet their medical needs fairly and swiftly, how to ensure that those at work are not exploited and that those who come to our shores are not denied their rights. These are the issues which affect Irish people in their daily lives but they are issues which are way beyond a Government which is weighed down by internal scandals.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that this Bill should come before us now. It is two years too late. I have remarked on a number of occasions that the economic policy being pursued has failed miserably everywhere it was tried. I cannot understand why the Government did not intervene earlier. I compliment my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, on bringing forward this Bill even at this late stage. What amazes me is that the economic philosophy and financial management pursued over the past two years do not measure up to his well-established principles.</P>
      <P>Measures were needed to check the spiralling rate of inflation. House prices are rising at an alarming rate and have been for the past number of years. I know it is not the Minister's philosophy to stand idly by but rather to do something about it. Nobody understands why what happened in Britain was allowed to continue happening here unchecked. The Government has decided to intervene at long last. However, instead of providing more houses to deal with the housing shortage it introduced in the market certain corrective measures. I do not believe these proposals will do anything to help those who require a house. The inflationary spiral will continue. There are more people seeking houses now than at any time since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>One of the false premises on which Government policy has been built is that it was doing relatively well by comparison with the previous year. If we go back ten years local authorities, including Kildare County Council on which the Minister and I were members, could build up to 350 houses in a year. That was reduced to 15 in the bad old times. In 1988, 1989 and 1990 no houses were built. Where it all went wrong was that nobody recognised the demand. With the upturn in the economy, the demand increased and nobody responded. Everyone looked to the previous year. If there was an increase of 100% in the number of local authority houses provided in every local authority area in the years after 1988 it meant nothing because we were way short of what was the norm in the early 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has intervened at last, obviously as a result of the alarm concerning the inflation figures. That was on the cards for 18 months and every commentator has spoken about it. The measures introduced by the Minister are an attempt to arrest the spiralling figures. One of the most alarming comments I have heard is that there is a noticeable slow down in the rate of house price increase and that prices have stopped increasing. I do not see any evidence of that. If the analysts have found it they are better than we who are on the ground. House prices are increasing on a daily basis and that will continue to be the position for as long as there are ten people <Col N="201" /> seeking to acquire every house that comes on the market.</P>
    <P>Many first time home seekers acquired their house through the local authority loans system. The SDA loan was increased to £50,000 in counties such as Kildare. That would not buy even half a house today. It would make no impact on the market. It is cynical to have such a level of loan. The shared ownership loan is not the best in the world but it is an attempt to address the urgent issue and it has done so to some extent. It is a maximum of £95,000 in Kildare. How many houses can one buy for that? None. One will not even get a look in the door for that amount. I cannot understand why measures have not been introduced that would have an immediate and dramatic impact on those seeking to acquire a house at a reasonable price. The Government is locked into an inflationary position. If the market tumbles we will have negative equity and that will be just as serious as the problem that existed in Britain in the late 1980s. The fact that it happened there has not rung a bell with us. Analysts said it could not happen here because we have ongoing demand but it can happen. If the economy takes a downturn as a result of fuelled inflation arising from spiralling house prices the position will change very quickly.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill it is dramatically late. It will not address the issues. It is unfortunate that the Minister must attempt to rescue this matter that has been allowed to drift for the past two years in a way that only those who did not have regard for the marketplace could ignore. The Bacon reports have come and gone. We were told that the first Bacon report was a dramatic attempt to address the problem. It had no impact, good, bad or indifferent. Nobody seemed to realise the real problem was a shortage of available housing to an ever increasing market. It did not even touch on the problem.</P>
    <P>If the measures that are being taken now had been taken two years ago there would have been some visible result at this stage. The recent budget was a give-away one. I envy my constituency colleague being in that position. I would have thought wise counsel would have prevailed in Departments and someone at the Cabinet table would have said this was a serious issue that needed to be addressed as it had been allowed to go unchallenged for the past number of years. Those of us who tried to do something about it by raising the matter at various committees, the Committee on Social Affairs, the Committee of Public Accounts and so on, and in other ways and who pinpointed the damage that was being done to the economy were treated with disdain. We were told we did not know what the issue was nor were we <i>au fait </i>with modern economics. However, we were on the ground, meeting our constituents, listening to what people were saying, looking at auctioneers' windows, watching prices rising on a daily basis and listening to our constituents telling us the maximum loan one could get, what the possibility of getting a house <Col N="202" /> was and why people who were on a housing list two years ago are still on it, whether it be a local authority list or a private housing one. The problem is virtually out of control.</P>
    <P>This measure is being introduced too late. It could well create further inflation. Once one begins to intervene in the natural market in this way, instead of supplying the market one creates further problems and obstacles. We should remember that we have availed of the open market in Europe and enjoyed dramatic economic benefits as a result. The Single Market meant the removal of tariffs, subsidies and interventions. We paid a high price for that at the beginning, but we availed of the opportunity and our economy has blossomed accordingly. The end will come when we start to reinvent the wheel and to intercept the natural course of the market. That is very dangerous, but it is about to happen. I hope this Bill has some positive impact, but I cannot see it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Ring for not having sufficient time to share with him, as he was anxious to contribute. I heard a startling statistic today from my county, where there are 1,500 people on the local authority waiting lists. This year Kerry County Council will probably build approximately 150 houses, so one can imagine the crisis people are facing. There are approximately 40,000 people on the waiting lists while there is a commitment to build approximately 5,000 houses. Those on the lists will experience a long wait, not to mention those who will be added to the lists soon. One must consider the asylum seekers and refugees who, once they receive their green books, will also be joining the waiting lists. We have a huge task ahead of us. If one looks at the number of houses built by the private sector, it has doubled since 1993, while the number of houses being built by local authorities has stayed the same. The local authority housing fund is under-resourced.</P>
      <P>There should be higher density housing available exclusively to first time buyers. That was suggested by the IHBA and should be adopted, as it would provide between 5,000 and 7,000 houses per annum. Public-private partnerships involving local authorities should also be considered. I mentioned the experience of Fingal County Council in this regard last week, where the public-private partnership was very successful. Only two local authorities do not own extensive land banks and establishing partnerships with builders would greatly accelerate the supply of houses on local authority lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan may have mentioned the need for the Government to invest more money in the shared ownership scheme, and I agree with him. With the amount of revenue coming from the building industry, this is an area in which the Government should invest. There is a need for intervention in the housing market. The Minister is doing so through taxation, but he must also use different schemes. The coalition Government of <Col N="203" /> the mid-1980s proved this when it opened up the housing market, although it did not have much resources. The Minister has the resources and creative and innovative schemes would help those with low incomes and on local authority housing lists in particular. This is a challenge to the Minister more than anyone else and I hope he measures up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell referred to the increases in house prices and the persistence of house price inflation in recent years. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, published figures for the first quarter of this year which show a reduction of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand houses in Dublin respectively. This moderation in prices is also reflected in new and second-hand house prices nationally. The document states that Deputy Molloy released:</P>
      <P>. . . his Department's latest house price data for the March quarter 2000 which shows that average house prices generally have stabilised and, in some cases, reduced since the last quarter of 1999. In fact the March quarter figures for Dublin show reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand houses respectively. This is the first quarter that average prices have dropped nationally and in Dublin since 1995. . . Year-on-year house price increases (March 2000 on March 1999 prices) are significantly lower than in previous quarters. Nationally, new and second-hand house prices rose by 13% and 14% on the same period last year, the lowest increases since 1996. In Dublin, annual increases of 13% and 17% have been recorded, also down on 12 month increases to December 1999.</P>
      <P>I can give the figures, but as Deputy Molloy said, this is the first time since 1995 that there has been a small drop in prices nationally and in Dublin. Prices have risen more than we would like, but we are getting the situation under control due to the action the Government is taking to confront the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed the first Bacon report and brought in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, I remember saying here and in the Seanad that the purpose of the Bill was to have a temporarily distorting effect on demand. The intention was to give a sharp jolt to the market in order to allow first time buyers to have some chance. The only way to get house prices under control is through supply and demand. As Deputy Noonan said on Second Stage, I am a believer in the market, that is no secret. I said that the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, was designed to have a temporarily distorting effect on demand, but the only medium or long-term solution to house prices is to bring supply into line with demand. We have expounded <Col N="204" /> on the reasons for the increase in demand in Ireland, but the main reason is our economic success. Due to economic growth there are more people in employment &ndash; approximately 1.7 million people are in employment in Ireland, while a few short years ago the figure was only one million. Instead of net emigration from Ireland we have people coming back and people are earning very good salaries. This is pushing up house prices because supply has not kept pace with demand.</P>
    <P>We can disagree about many economic theories. Many such theories have debunked themselves over the past 20 years and I played no small part in debunking others. However, we can all agree on one fundamental law of economics: when demand is greater than supply &ndash; of any product &ndash; the price goes up. That is what has been happening in the housing market for some time. Deputy Durkan referred to the situation in my county and I have seen that at first hand over a long period. Dublin, Wicklow and Meath are all part of the greater Dublin area and we have had to deal with the population overflow and the demand this has placed on housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made a valid point which I have made previously on Question Time. He talked about trying to line up &ndash; if I am quoting him correctly &ndash; national policy from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and what is happening in local authority areas. I see from where he is coming because I see local authorities getting directives about increasing densities for a period of time, but I do not see much of that in certain counties around Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have referred to another factor on a number of occasions here and we have experienced this in County Kildare as well. If Deputy Durkan was here, he would be able to attest to it, having had experience of it for the past five years. We recognise there is a housing supply problem but Deputies who give out about the price of houses going up, go along with every pressure group set up in their constituencies to stop houses being built. One cannot marry the two things. There should be a reasonable amount of development in areas with good planning and control. One cannot be against all development. Some Members want it both ways &ndash; they want to be able to give out about the price of houses while at the same time they want to be able to play to some constituents who do not want any extra housing built next nor near them. It just does not square. Local authorities are trying to grapple with this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said the Government had ignored the three Bacon reports and did not understand the dynamics of the housing market. I do not accept this proposition. Action was taken, and in a speedy manner, after each Bacon report. The Government understands the need to bring supply and demand into balance. Our policies are aimed at bringing forward substantial increases in supply by removing the speculative demand from the market. An enormous amount <Col N="205" /> of investment is going into infrastructural investment which will reap rewards and help to provide the homes and accommodation we all want to see. In relation to rented accommodation, our interest is to put the rented sector on a firm basis capable of providing long-term supply of residential units. We established the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and will act on its report as required.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will note from the Bill, there is a considerable number of outs where the anti-speculative tax will not apply. The first and third Bacon reports are not just centred on the tax measures in order to have an effect on demand. There are such items there, and that is what we are dealing with here, but the whole thrust of the Bacon report and Government policy for some time has been to increase supply. We have had the serviced land initiative. I acceded to nearly every reasonable request from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for more water and sewerage schemes to open up the prospect of more development land so more housing will be built. That is now coming on stream. One cannot simply make a decision today and houses will come on stream tomorrow. That is not the way the market operates. Deputies will see within a period of time how this is having an impact. That is the way one will get supply back in sync with demand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked if the Department had an estimate of the extent of the hoarding of development land in the Dublin region. Last year an official expounded the theory on the national airwaves that land was being held. I do not have the document with me at present but no less an authority than the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, took the opposite view in a recent article. He said it was now his opinion &ndash; this was before we published the third Bacon report &ndash; that there was an active supply of development land in the Dublin and greater Dublin areas and that, according to all the evidence he could find in the past year, it was being substantially traded.</P>
    <P>Bacon put forward suggestions in his report that people would be penalised if they did not put this land onto the housing market in time. I introduced a section in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, to encourage people to do that. We are seeing greater supply at present. I do not have evidence of the amount of land held but I believe trade in development land has been increasing at a rate of knots in the past 18 months or so. In regard to the person who made the submission last year that land was being hoarded, I have seen no concrete evidence of whether that is correct. It is my view that the balance lies more in what Dr. FitzGerald said about the matter, that is, that the problem is not as great as it might have been some time ago.</P>

      <P>In regard to the proposal in the Bacon report, which the Minister mentioned, obliging developers to act on a planning permission once it has been granted or face a fine of £3,000, is the Government committed to doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the suggestion Bacon makes in regard to the strategic development zones, SDZs. When that rapid planning permission process has been gone through and people get permission to build houses, there will be a levy of £3,000 per housing unit if they do not build. The Government is committed to that and it will be included in a subsequent Finance Bill or a local government Bill from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There are many tax matters surrounding this and this could be regarded as a levy or a tax matter. We will discuss all this in the context of the tax strategy group. With all the different suggestions going around, we had better not bring in something which would contradict another, otherwise we could end up with a bad situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell suggested housing supply is constrained by land hoarding. I have dealt with this matter. I am not sure of the evidence in this regard and I do not want to start a dispute about it. My view is similar to Dr. FitzGerald's, who said this may have been a problem, but that is was no longer a problem. That is my belief as well. That gentleman who spoke last year did not produce the evidence to show land was being hoarded, which I would have thought was necessary.</P>
      <P>The evidence would seem to be in the other direction. There has been a record output of over 10,000 housing units in Dublin 1999. Completions to date in 2000 point to a further record of output of housing in Dublin. An analysis undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in conjunction with the consultants indicate a three to four year supply of zoned serviced land and a similar level of development land at the various stages of the planning process.</P>
      <P>The Government measures set out in Action on Housing will remove infrastructure and planning constraints on housing supply. The use of strategic development zones for housing also involves the introduction of an annual levy of £3,000 per housing site unit in the event that the development site does not proceed as scheduled. This is a necessary <i>quid pro quo</i> for the fast-tracking of infrastructure provision and planning in the strategic development zones. Action on Housing also provides that the scope and implications for further tax measures designed to bring serviced zoned residential land into development will be examined urgently by the tax strategy group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> There has been a vast increase in the number of local authority housing starts. There is the multi-annual programme of 25,000 starts over four years. Local authorities are being given every encouragement to front-load their programmes. The local authority SDA loan limit doubled from £50,000 to £100,000 in Action on Housing. Income limits for SDA loans, shared ownership and affordable housing schemes increased from £20,000 to £25,000.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe in the free market and the way to control the price of houses is to increase supply. As a general principle, it is a tricky enough measure to interfere in the market. It is a measure whereby one cannot really predict the outcomes. I am saying so because it would be against all I ever stood for. I also said this at the time of the first Bacon report. When one interferes in the market one does not know what the effect will be. There were predictions at the time of the first Bacon report that it would happen in the case of the supply of rented accommodation. I agreed because it would take them out. Others said that no one would have rental accommodation. I stated that the price would go up in time as the market got into synch and people would get back into the market. When one interferes in a market as fluid as the housing market one can never be certain about what will happen. The Bacon report is trying to apply a shock to the demand side together with the supply side measures and things will work out over time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are grouped by the Bills Office in a manner which is somewhat difficult to follow. I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to do. For example, amendments Nos. 3 and 22 are grouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about first time purchasers who are buying a second hand house. These people will have paid a deposit and signed a contract with their solicitor which has not been countersigned by the vendor. As a result, they could be caught in a limbo between 15 and 16 June. I am proposing that an alternative proof of the bona fides of the purchaser would be inserted in the Bill which would amount to a receipt for the payment of the deposit and a written contract executed by the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for the purposes of proof of intent to purchase it would not be necessary that the contract in question was enforceable or unconditional. Many solicitors would have proceeded to the point where the deposit would have been paid and the contract would have been signed by one side. However, there are significant delays <Col N="211" /> because of the amount of business in the conveyancing sections of solicitors' offices. I urge the Minister to accept these amendments so people will not be caught simply because of a professional delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's comments. We are talking about people who have commenced the process of purchasing a property, have put down a booking or contract deposit and have indicated their bona fides in terms of seeking to purchase the property. We all live in the real world and know it is possible and, dare I say it, likely that some contracts will be back-dated to take advantage of the date prescribed by the Minister. It should not be necessary for people to behave in what is essentially a dishonest manner and I am sure people would not wish to do so.</P>
      <P>We have to examine situations where people have commenced the process of purchasing a property in good faith. The intention is to give the benefit to such people and Deputy Noonan's suggestion is reasonable in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 would appear to be to exclude investors from the 9% stamp duty in a case where the purchaser had already paid a deposit and signed a contract prior to the financial resolution of 15 June 2000, notwithstanding the fact that the vendor had not signed the contract prior to that date or that the contract was still conditional immediately prior to the date. Under the existing wording of the Bill it is unnecessary that a contract exists and that it is evidenced in writing prior to 15 June 2000. It is not necessary that the contract be signed or that it be unconditional. Deputy Noonan's concerns have, therefore, been addressed in the wording as drafted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 22 is to exclude certain contracts from the scope of section 5(5). Section 5(5) provides that for the purpose of deciding who is the person liable for the new tax in the case where the party in question is subject to a contract for a sale on the relevant valuation date, the existence of the contract is to be ignored. In the unlikely event that a property which was contractually sold before 15 June was still subject to that same contract on 6 April 2001 or some later valuation date, the wording of section 5(5) provides that such a contract be excluded from this provision. As I have already explained, the Deputy's concerns in this area are already addressed in the Bill as drafted. Under the existing wording, it is not necessary that the contract in question be signed or that it be unconditional. Accordingly, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have transposed to this Bill the transitional arrangements which applied to the change of circumstances in the 1998 Bill. This matter caused confusion before and there were some discussions with the Incorporated Law Society and the Revenue Commissioners who are satisfied with the arrangements. A contract regarding the sale of <Col N="212" /> property must be evidenced in writing. For example, if I made an arrangement with Deputy Noonan to buy his car, although I hope I will not have to buy a private car for quite a while&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is after the Minister's car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan cannot buy my car. He would be get it free from the State. If I made a private arrangement with Deputy Noonan to buy his car at a certain price, we would have agreed a contract which would be enforceable. If Deputy Noonan changed his mind and wanted a higher price, the arrangement would be enforceable because we had made an agreement. However, if one was to agree a price on property or land, it would have to be evidenced in writing. This matter is clearly stated in law.</P>
      <P>As it has been explained to me, evidence in writing does not necessarily mean a contract has to be drawn up and signed by Deputy Noonan as the vendor and me as the purchaser. However, there must be evidence in writing and there have been interesting cases in Irish conveyancing law in this regard. Evidence in writing means exactly that &ndash; something in writing. I hope I am not misleading the House. There is a well-known case relating to the sale of property and businesses. This matter has been clarified with the Incorporated Law Society. This amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan made a separate case which relates to deposits paid. As we discussed previously, a booking deposit, unless there is something in writing, is exactly as it implies, a booking deposit. It does not necessarily mean there is a contract. What we are doing here is exactly the same as we did in 1998 regarding the transitional arrangements. Deputy McDowell, a solicitor, might know a little more about this. I hope I have not said anything incorrect. That is my understanding regarding the 1998 and current arrangements about evidence in writing. If I am wrong, my learned officials will tell me. They believe I am right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence in writing proposed in the amendment would include a receipt for the payment of a booking deposit and a written contract executed by the purchaser. The amendment is not an either/or provision but both. I am left in the position where I have to accept learned counsel's legal opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>To disturb the consensus. As I understand it, the Bill as phrased only covers some of the instances we are talking about. The usual practice when a booking deposit is received by an estate agent is that they set out the details of the agreement but then include a rider that the contract is not enforceable and that memo is not <Col N="213" /> a memo for the purpose of the statute of frauds and is therefore not enforceable as such. As I understand it, the Bill when enacted will not allow that letter or the paying of a deposit to be evidence of the contract because usually it will specify it is not meant to imply the existence of a contract. One would need to progress to the stage of an unconditional contract.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the contract does not need to be executed, or at least not executed by both parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I understand existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract would not normally be enforceable if it was not executed. The Minister is informed by his officials that the existence of a written contract will be sufficient, notwithstanding the fact it is not executed. That progresses matters a little further. However, that being the case, there is no real reason one could not go back one stage and accept the booking deposit and the memo from the estate agent. This will be arbitrary one way or another. There will be a certain amount of &ldquo;readying-up&rdquo; no matter what happens. We might as well cast it in such a way to minimise the number of hard cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the way we have done it before and it has been accepted. If it is not done this way between now and next year's Finance Bill, I will look at the matter again. This did not cause difficulty in 1998 or any other time we have had transitional arrangements. We had no complaints and I do not anticipate any on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, there are also a number of hard cases. Young couples who were first time purchasers of second-hand homes were charged stamp duty a couple of weeks ago which they would not have to pay now. I know the changes took place on the strike of midnight on 15 June. However, to be human about it, people who had scrimped and saved a deposit to purchase a house, one would feel very sore if they had paid stamp duty on a starter home at £125,000 in the west of Dublin when now one does not have to pay any stamp duty. The amendment, which was ruled out of order, sought to backdate the provision, only in respect of first time purchasers of second-hand homes, to the start of the tax year, 6 April or the start of the year, 1 January. I know there is no legal case for this but we have all received representations. I have received half a dozen telephone calls from people asking if there is any chance that this can <Col N="214" /> be backdated as they had just signed a contract and are liable for stamp duty. If they could get it back, they could furnish the house. As a gesture of goodwill which would not cost very much, the Minister should backdate the provision to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might cost a great deal of money. Much as I would like to accede to the requests of the Deputy and his colleagues who have received representations and the Department of Finance who have also received representations, I would not like to create a precedent. It is traditional that taxation changes come into effect on the night of the budget or sometimes on the day an amendment to the Finance Bill is published or announced. We do not go beyond that date. For example, last year I made a significant change to capital acquisitions tax and applied it to inheritances arising on or after 1 December. I received many representations from deserving cases whose relatives had passed on in previous months. If I established such a precedent, there would not ever be a final date. It would haunt successive Ministers for Finance. Deputy Noonan proposed that the provision should be backdated to 1 January 2000 which is no better or worse a date than any other. What happens in the cases of those who signed a contract on 31 December? There are always cases where people are excluded. Much as I understand the Deputy's argument, I cannot accede to making a change.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the section. There are two changes I would like to make. First, I <Col N="215" /> would like the imposition of stamp duty at a nil rate to extend to second-hand homes up to the value of £200,000 rather than the £150,000 proposed by the Minister. That would be more in line with the Dublin market at the moment. I appreciate that the £150,000 limit will benefit purchasers of the average house around the country. However, the average second-hand house in Dublin costs significantly more than £150,000 now &ndash; probably around £170,000 or £175,000. That is the purpose of a series of amendments I have tabled.</P>
      <P>Also the rate of 9% is excessive and should be reversed to the <i>status quo</i>. I intervene now because I found this Bill technically difficult to deal with from the Opposition benches. Normally one would look at the Explanatory Memorandum and attempt to draft amendments to change the numbers in the Explanatory Memorandum. However, when one turns to the Bill, there are no such numbers in the text of the Bill. Cross-referencing to the Principal Act is great fun if one has research facilities like those in Congress in Washington, but not when one has only one full-time secretary who is working on constituency business all day. We simply do not have the facilities here, so the Minister will bear with me if the debate is a little ragged.</P>

      <P>This section, together with the Schedule to the Bill, imposes the new stamp duty rates on conveyances, transfers and leases of residential property. These are as follows: aggregate consideration, other than rent, not exceeding £100,000 is subject to a rate of 9%; amounts between £100,001 and £150,000 are subject to 9%, and so on. Section 3 amends Schedule 1 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999, to replace existing rates by the new rates and these are contained in the Schedule to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just think that stamp duty at 9% is a bad idea. It will drive investors out of the market. As the Minister argued earlier in respect of mortgage interest relief in relation to investment property, which he abolished previously, the market will reassert itself and find a new equilibrium. That is right. The market will reassert itself in this case and find a new equilibrium. Investors will not stay out permanently. Some will come back in, despite the 9%. However, rents will go up. The investor who re-enters the market paying stamp duty at 9% on £200,000 will need to recoup £18,000 and he has only one place to go for it. As well as that, once the investors are out of the market, given the state of the rental property market in Dublin at the moment, many people will be looking for houses and the rental market will be very tight.</P>
      <P>Much of what the Government is doing is contradictory. I am sure the Minister appreciates this. The Government is at loggerheads with itself. The Tánaiste, with Craig Barrett, announced a huge new extension to Intel in Leixlip last week. One thousand workers are supposedly going in. At the press conference, Intel announced that 50% of those workers would have to be brought in from continental Europe because the local labour market could not supply the demand. That means that of the 1,000 workers, 500 will be coming in immediately. Where are they going to live? Does the Minister think they are going to buy houses? They will be all over west Dublin looking for rental accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened before. Now we have students coming into Dublin and our own young people coming back from abroad. The population of Ireland is rising, particularly on the east coast. The population of young people in Dublin is increasing by the week. They will all need rental accommodation and this measure will put a block on the market. Investors will clear out. I agree totally with the Minister that a new equilibrium will occur. I am a free market adherent too, but in a different way. There will be a new equilibrium and rents will go up, and when the rents go up new investors will come back into the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be some merit in this if we were in a tight fiscal position and the Government needed the revenue. However, there is no suggestion that the Government needs revenue. This is purely a tool of management and it is a deliberate policy choice to put on 9%. Someone has a theory that if 9% is put on investment residential property the result will be to reduce the price of houses. That will not happen. Many of the people who are in rental accommodation paying <Col N="217" /> increased rents are young couples trying to put a deposit together to buy a new house. This is what I meant when I said on Second Stage that it is a seamless market. The supply cannot be reduced in one sector without causing knock-on effects on local authority housing lists and on the supply of new houses. I do not agree with the section. It is a very bad idea and the Minister probably does not agree with it himself. The net point is that if the Minister puts it to the House, I will call for a voice vote on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who has a little less faith in the free market than either of my two colleagues, allow me to intervene on this. I support the 9% rate. However, I do not disagree with most of what Deputy Noonan has said. It will take investors out of the market, probably for a period of two years, more or less. It is more than likely that they will come back in, and if they come back into the market in circumstances where supply has not increased in the meantime, rents will undoubtedly go up.</P>
      <P>What I assume this measure is intended to do &ndash; it is the reason I support it &ndash; is to give us the breathing space, the couple of years we need in order to bring supply on stream. That is the only reason I seek to reallocate the limited supply available at the moment so as to favour first-time buyers. To do that it is necessary to take investors out of the market. Nobody believes that taking investors out of the market is good in itself. It is not. We need investors in the market. We need people to invest with a view to renting out. The fact that we have to interrupt the normal flow of investment for the next two or three years is regrettable, but it is something that simply has to be done because of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, if the supply has not increased by the time the effects of which Deputy Noonan speaks come into play in two or three years' time, the whole thing will have been a miserable failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were the full picture, I would agree with Deputy McDowell. However, the other point, which I made on Second Stage, is that one cannot interfere with demand without affecting supply. Anybody who is in touch with planning offices around the country knows that already developers who intended building 20 apartments on a corner site are now inquiring from the planning officials about how a commercial application would be treated. It is not a question of investors being driven out of the market. Builders are being driven out as well. The supply of residential units is, therefore, being reduced because the developers who were going to build the 20 apartments on a corner site near a shop for the rental market now see it as a bad idea. They will say they cannot get people to buy them, given the combination of the 2% and the 9% stamp duty, and as a consequence they will think about a series of offices over a number of small shops. That is what is happening in planning <Col N="218" /> offices in the real world. I think the Minister well understands this, but the political people in the Department of the Environment and Local Government do not understand that supply adjusts as soon as demand is affected. While builders who are half way through a building project cannot adjust a development, resulting in a temporary favourable blip, supply and demand will find a new equilibrium in a very short period, given that builders are in the market for profit.</P>

      <P>I do not want to do the Minister's job for him, but the evidence in the third Bacon report is instructive in this regard and suggests there was a short-term slowing, particularly in the building of apartments. However, it was only short-term. Last year 44% of new house units were apartments, most of which were for rental, compared to 30% the previous year. This suggests that builders very quickly came back into the market because they realised money was to be made.</P>

      <P>The 9% is not a revenue raising measure, not that the Department of Finance is averse to revenue raising measures. I listened to the debate and there are merits on both sides of the argument. I know the theory behind the proposal which is to take out of the market for a period the investor and in the interim supply will increase. If supply does not increase, the investor will return to the market in the way Deputy Noonan suggested. Deputy Noonan also suggested that developers responding to the market will examine schemes to see if residential developments can be changed to commercial developments. However, as the economy comes back into line, that would not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theory is that the proposal will have a temporary distortionary effect, allowing supply to catch up with demand. As I said in an earlier contribution, all the consequences of making adjustments to the market cannot be predicted. Bacon refers to the reasonably well paid person &ndash; a Deputy, a Minister or a professional person &ndash; getting into the market in anticipation that prices will continue to rise. This could give the bubble effect. We want to take investors out of the market for a period, and we make no apologies for that. We want to give the market a chance of reaching equilibrium so that first time buyers will have a chance. That is the basis and <i>raison d'être</i> of these proposals. In terms of the first report, Mr. Bacon was correct in that it had an effect for <Col N="219" /> a short time, but the market returned to equilibrium, as I said it would on more than one occasion in the House. This is what normally happens in a market. The economy has continued to grow, as has the number of people returning. Deputy Noonan referred to the recent announcement of an additional 1,000 jobs at Intel in my county.</P>
    <P>Taking all the measures into account, including the supply side measures which make up the bulk of the three Bacon reports, and the other initiatives taken by the Government, supply should come into line with demand. Of course, if tens of thousands continue to come to Ireland over the coming years and economic growth continues, the market will remain out of sync. This is one of the down sides of economic growth, but nobody is suggesting we double unemployment to 10% or have between 40,000 to 60,000 leaving the country every year, as happened in the 1980s. I made this point during Question Time in the context of inflation and other matters. One cannot deal with one small segment of the economy. We could solve the tightening of the labour market, for example, if we doubled unemployment, but nobody is suggesting that.</P>
    <P>This proposal is an attempt by Bacon to introduce another distortionary effect for a period, namely, to take out the investor. I think it will work, definitely in the short-term. In the longer term if supply does not meet demand, the market will again find its own equilibrium. Stamp duty of 9% will affect people's thinking unless they are very wealthy. I know from friends in my county that people in the very recent past were buying blocks of six houses or eight apartments. People from Deputy Enright's and Deputy Noonan's counties were&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those in this market were not all solicitors, barristers or such people, but people I would consider to be of moderate income, the same as those going to Spain and Portugal to buy properties. They are very ordinary, not wealthy, people who could be regarded as having an ordinary standard of living. This is the result of people having more disposable income and people are entitled to so invest &ndash; I wish them the best of luck. Unfortunately, I am not in a financial position to do the same. The anticipation was that people could not lose, that the market would continue to grow, that the investment would <Col N="220" /> return good rents and that selling the houses or apartments would result in a reasonable capital gain. The temporary tax measures on the demand side are to discourage people from so investing. Discouraging people from buying three or four houses or apartments should bring the market back somewhat and stabilise prices to give some chance to first time buyers. Other downsides have been alluded to by myself and other Members, but the <i>raison d'être</i> of the Bacon reports is to give Joe Enright, for example, from Birr who is married or thinking of getting married the chance of buying a house. Hopefully, this aim will be achieved.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exempt houses up to a value of £200,000 from stamp duty. Under the Minister's proposal the Bill will apply to houses up to a value of £150,000. I would like to see this figure raised to £200,000. The £150,000 limit is reasonable in respect of houses outside Dublin but if the average house in the greater Dublin area is to be caught, the figure needs to be raised to a minimum of £175,000 or £180,000. The sum of £200,000 is a nice round figure which would allow for the increases in house prices which will inevitably occur as a consequence of the Bill in the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, would have the same effect of pushing up the exemption limit from £150,000 to £200,000. Deputy Noonan is right, the average figure outside Dublin is less than £150,000 whereas the average price of a new house in Dublin is £160,000 plus and of a second hand house, £175,000 plus. To put it in simple terms therefore the average house in Dublin will not be caught by the Bill which will not benefit sufficiently first time purchasers of average houses in the greater Dublin area. Setting the exemption limit at £150,000 was to be to their benefit but to do so effectively it has to be pushed out a little further.</P>

      <P>I fully support the amendment. To try to ease the problems presented by stamp duty, in his initial efforts the Minister raised the exemption limit in stages but they were of insufficient benefit. If he had been more generous he could have assisted many of those for whom stamp duty caused financial difficulties because of the value of their incomes and the house being purchased. House prices in towns such as Tullamore and Portlaoise are slightly above average. This is causing problems for purchasers. The figure of £200,000 is, therefore, reasonable and would be of benefit to many people who would otherwise be caught for onerous stamp duty.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to increase the first time buyer exemption limit from £150,000 to £200,000. Deputy Noonan has also proposed a revised scale of rates for first time buyers. In increasing the first time buyer limit from £60,000 to £150,000 and in giving a 25% reduction on other owner-occupier rates applying between £150,000 and £300,000 we are responding fully to the needs of first time buyers. In 1999 the average price paid by a first time buyer for a new house in the country as a whole was £100,000 and in Dublin, £126,000. It is likely that the figures for second hand houses vary significantly from these figures. I will keep the position under review and will consider an increased limit should this be necessary as time elapses. Accordingly, I must oppose the amendments.</P>

      <P>Yes. In the debate on the financial resolutions passed two weeks ago Fine Gael's able spokesperson on housing, Deputy Hayes, made an interesting contribution on stamp duty which was later repeated. Fine Gael has been proposing for some time that the limits should be raised. As Deputy Noonan rightly reminded me I was opposed to this. I had many good grounds for so doing. We have now taken account of the suggestions made by Mr. Bacon. I expressed the viewpoint previously that in increasing the thresholds in this way one will also push up prices by the same level as the stamp duty saving will be eaten into by the vendor. One either believes that the market will take care of itself or that it will not. Deputy Hayes inadvertently made this point for me in his contribution. I reminded him&mdash;</P>

      <P>The increase in the exemption limit should be of benefit to first time buyers but there is a view, with which I do not necessarily disagree, that the market reacts quickly. I have a feeling that in pushing the exemption limit to a higher level prices will move in the same direc<Col N="223" /> tion. The changes proposed by Mr. Bacon under which the exemption limit will be pushed from £60,000 to £150,000 are substantial. The figure is realistic and I hope I will not have to readjust it in years to come.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 3, to delete &ldquo;property.&rdquo;.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;property.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is a technical drafting change to facilitate the second amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the second amendment is twofold. First, the trustees of a trust, whose trust funds are established out of public subscriptions for the benefit of permanently incapacitated persons, will be entitled to first-time buyer relief in respect of the first house bought, following the establishment of the trust, for occupation by the beneficiary or where there is more than one beneficiary, for each of the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Second, a person, who has left the former marital home due to the marriage having been dissolved or the subject of a judicial separation and who buys a new house to live in, will be entitled to claim first-time purchaser relief provided that, at the time of the purchase, he or she does not retain an interest in that former marital home and that, at the time of the new purchase, the other spouse still occupies the former marital home which was occupied by both of them prior to the dissolution or judicial separation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy Noonan's amendment is to give first-time purchaser relief to both spouses where a marriage breaks up in various ways and the family home is sold. The amendment in my name already cover most situations which are the subject of Deputy Noonan's amendment, and I believe will deal with the main hardship situations involving marriage break-up.</P>
      <P>The question of nullity is more difficult as a decree of nullity effectively means that a couple were never legally married. Granting first-time buyer status in such cases would raise the question of equality of treatment with unmarried cohabiting couples. While this is a difficult area, I will keep the definition of &ldquo;firsttime buyer&rdquo; under review and, if necessary, bring forward amendments for the 2001 finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I must put forward my own amendments and in the meantime oppose the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure to what extent the second portion of the amendment meets my intent. I wanted to change the definition of the first-time purchaser to include persons who have to purchase a dwellinghouse after a marriage was broken up by one of the legal methods by which people separate, that is, divorce, nullity or separation; and where the settlement would involve the sale of the principle private residence, that parties to the marriage would be treated as if they were first-time purchasers, if either or both subsequently had to buy a home. Has the Minister met the intent of my amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that I have, except on the question of nullity. As I said, the question of nullity is quite complex in that a decree of nullity is a <i>de facto</i> decision by the court that a marriage never existed in the first place, but I dealt with all other aspects in my amendment or at least I think so. If anything has been left out, I must come back to it on the next finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The intention of my amendments was to ensure that where a marriage breaks up by a decree of divorce or by judicial separation, that person is not penalised as a result. The Deputy's amendment involved a similar idea. The only difference is that Deputy Noonan's amendment includes the provisions in my amendment but also mentions a decree of nullity.</P>

      <P>I agree that it states that a marriage did not exist in the first place, but a family home did exist. If it must be sold arising from nullity proceedings, the persons in the marriage which was annulled should be treated as first time purchasers when they have to find accommodation.</P>

      <P>Another problem exists with people who are co-habitees. How would I deal with such people when they break up? They were not married in the first place, which is the same as the decree of nullity. That adds further complications.</P>

      <P>Yes, but neither of us propose to deal with that. Ultimately the courts will decide on it because someone will take a person to court on the grounds that he or she was a common law spouse. A decision will then have to be made. The argument put forward by the Minister does not negative the argument that nullity should be included if separation and divorce are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter considered further in the finance Bill but, in the limited time available to us, I have decided it would be unwise for me to open up a vista at this stage regarding the question of co-habitees. Many people in relationships do not get married nowadays, and I would create other difficulties were I to deal with them in the Bill. However, I can consider it between now and 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>There are two other circumstances which the Minister should consider. One is the commonplace arrangement whereby people separate and it is a recognised separation done by agreement which does not require a decree in court. As the Minister doubtless knows, most people who obtain a judicial separation do so without the need to go to court and obtain a decree. It seems unreasonable to penalise people who are able to come to agreement without the intervention of the courts, and that could be dealt with by a relatively simple amendment.</P>
      <P>There is the slightly more complicated circumstances of people, who might come under the Family Law Act, 1981, who have bought a house in contemplation of marriage. The law already deals with those people and provides for the division of the property in circumstances where the marriage does not take place. If an engaged couple buy a house and break up before they get married &ndash; unfortunately this happens more often than we might think &ndash; at least one of the couple, if it is only one who is buying another house, should be entitled to the first time buyer's exemption and reduced rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the nullity question, we are speaking of the house in which the couple had been living and the fact that, if the house is sold because of nullity, they will not receive the benefit of exemptions when they each buy other houses. Nullity is similar to a divorce in that the couple initially purchased the house in the belief a marriage existed which it later transpired did not because a decree of nullity was obtained. That is very similar to the cases where the exemption is granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the two amendments I had tabled to section 4. One amendment sought to redefine the definition of &ldquo;first-time purchasers&rdquo; by including the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;. Essentially I am seeking clarification from the Minister and to cater for the position where people return from abroad. A person might have emigrated and purchased a house in Britain or on the Continent or wherever. Are those people treated as first time purchasers when they return?

      <P>There is a case for doing so. The Bacon report uses the figure of 200,000 which is taken from statements made recently by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It suggests the Government is seeking to encourage up to 200,000 people to come into the country. Many would have purchased properties abroad. Many people might have left Ireland when they were young, stayed in England or elsewhere for ten to 15 years and purchased a property. They are selling properties in a market which has much lower property prices than here and they find it difficult to return as a result. If it is our policy to encourage them to return and work, we need to give them additional assistance in getting into the housing market as well as the labour market. It could be effected by a relatively simple amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Deputy says, but the basic principle of the Bacon initiative is to try to get the first time buyer on to the first rung of the ladder. We are trying to help the Deputy's constituents who cannot get into the housing market at present to get their first foot on the housing ladder. I take the Deputy's point about people returning from abroad but the purpose of this range of measures in the third Bacon report is not aimed at such people but at people resident here who cannot get on the first step of the ladder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed on the substance of the amendment I tabled but I take it that the Minister is not inclined to accept it. It is Government policy to encourage people to return. State agencies in Britain, North America and in Germany are encouraging Irish people resident there to return home. One of the reasons they cannot do it is because they cannot get into the housing market. This would be a useful means of helping them do that. In any event, the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, so perhaps he will revisit the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 5, but in Part 1, too insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;Stamp duty shall be payable by first time purchasers (as defined in section 4) at the rate applicable only on that part of the consideration which exceeds the threshold at which that rate becomes payable.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the amendments to the resolutions which I proposed last week. We had a fascinating discussion about slabs and steps. The Minister argued for the step way of doing things as opposed to the slab method. Essentially, we are saying that, once a person becomes liable for stamp duty, he is liable on the entire property and the immediate impact is very heavy. There should be some means of mediating that impact to make it more gradual. This amendment is intended to apply only to first time purchasers as another way of assisting them enter the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often found that, because I have never had any disagreements in those discussions.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is a method of raising revenue for the State, and it takes a certain amount of money to provide health and educational services and social welfare payments. Stamp duty is an important revenue raising measure for the State. Deputy McDowell and others have proposed that there should be a threshold which would act as an exemption limit and above which the different rates would be paid. If that were to be done, the entire stamp duty code would have to be restructured. If there were an exemption of £150,000, for example, stamp duty rates of 30%, 40% or 50% would have to be applied not that much higher up the scale to achieve the same monetary returns. Therefore, even though there is a certain attractiveness to this at face value, if there was a £150,000 exemption limit, giving all first time buyers an opportunity to enter the market, we would, however, have to raise the same amount of money in stamp duty. The stamp duty rates would be colossal to raise the revenue accruing from stamp duty at present. That is why I oppose this.</P>
      <P>We never adopted such an approach to stamp duty in the past and it is not my intention to introduce it now. If Deputy McDowell becomes Minister for Finance after the next election, he can introduce such a proposition.</P>

      <P>The take from stamp duty has increased enormously in recent years, largely because the price of houses has increased enormously. We are now taking in a multiple of what we took in five years ago. The specific proposals in this amendment are geared only at first time buyers, not the rest of the system. It would, therefore, take in only a small number of the people paying stamp duty. It is not true to say that in order to maintain the high levels of take we have from stamp duty, we would need very high rates. The reduction in the total take would be sustainable in the current budgetary context.</P>

The cost of stamp duty changes as an estimated loss to what the figure would have been without the changes must be included as a caveat.

      <P>No Minister for Finance had the courage or ingenuity to introduce a system where <Col N="233" /> stamp duty is paid in a graded manner. Someone buying a house for £150,000 will pay a certain rate of stamp duty. Once the price rises to £150,001 the rate may rise from 3% to 4% just because of £1 extra. I accept that the State must provide ancillary services such as education, health and public transport, but the take in stamp duty on residential property has risen from £117 million in 1996 to £241 million this year. It is important to collect tax but it should not be so punitive. To penalise first time buyers or those buying homes for their sons or daughters is very harsh. There should be a graded system with exemptions at certain levels. Such a system should have been introduced long ago.</P>
      <P>We have not reached section 16 but the penalty clause for those who are late paying their penalties should be re-examined. A penalty of 1% per month for someone who is not in a position to pay the money there and then is excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Teresa's national school, Killflynn, Tralee, County Kerry, currently has four teachers. However, it is about to suffer the loss of one of those teachers because in September 1999 pupil numbers fell below the level required to retain a fourth teacher. Although pupil numbers fell below the required figure at that stage, it has since taken on additional pupils. The total number of pupils in the school is now 85, two more than the required level of 83.</P>
      <P>The school has appealed to the Department of Education and Science for permission to retain its fourth teacher but I understand that its efforts have been to no avail. The school authorities are concerned about the loss of the teacher and they believe it will be extremely detrimental to the children's education. Their concerns arise for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>Additional pressures will be placed on teachers who are already teaching two classes and who will now be obliged to take a third class, despite the fact that pupil numbers are above the level required for four teachers. The current classrooms are approximately half the recommended size for classrooms set out in the Department's guidelines for new buildings. The school authorities are already concerned about the number of children accommodated in these small rooms and they must now deal with a situation where a classroom will have to be closed. As a result, the additional children will have to be accommodated in already overcrowded rooms. There will also be a need to introduce a new curriculum in light of this position. The authorities are also concerned about the school's current lack of facilities &ndash; it has no sports hall, drama hall or arts area and there are few outside sheltered play areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For children to partake fully in the new curriculum to which I refer, an onus will be placed on <Col N="235" /> the school to transport them to outside facilities. This will probably not be possible if the school loses a teacher while retaining its current number of pupils. The safety of the children may also be jeopardised due to the physical layout of the school's play areas, which make it difficult for three teachers to provide adequate supervision during break times. The children already experience a certain level of disadvantage as a result of living in a rural area, where access to social amenities is restricted. The loss of a teacher will increase this disadvantage because it will be difficult for the remaining teachers to support extra-curricular activities.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to recognise the difficulties presented by the mixed age group vertical teaching model which is so common in rural schools. I urge him to review the teacher-pupil ratio in such circumstances. I understand there are a further 50 schools with problems similar to those which obtain at St. Teresa's. However, St. Teresa's now has 85 pupils, two above the requirement for a fourth teacher, and I believe its case should be given priority over other schools. The parents and teachers involved with St. Teresa's would welcome it if the Minister could respond positively.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House in relation to the staffing position in St. Teresa's primary school, Killflynn, Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is agreed between the Department of Education and Science and the relevant unions and has been the <i>status quo</i> for many years. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this particular school on 30 September 1998 was 86 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the current school year of a principal and three mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher. However, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 81 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2000-01 school year of a principal and two mainstream class teachers. The number of pupils required to retain the third mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is a minimum of 83. Unfortunately, the school will lose the third mainstream class teaching post at the end of the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the permanent teacher whose post is being suppressed has obtained redeploy<Col N="236" /> ment in another school for the 2000-01 school year. However, if the board of management of the school believes that the enrolment for September 2000 will increase substantially it may apply for a post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria. The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria for the 2000-01 school year are outlined in circular letter 11/2000, a copy of which was forwarded recently to the board of management of the school. The Deputy can rest assured that if the school qualifies under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria, the matter will receive favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>With each passing week, substantial sums of money are being lost to the Exchequer as a result of an ongoing dispute at the Ordnance Survey Office. A further £170,000 in taxpayers' money has been spent on hardship payments to the four workers at the centre of the dispute. The longer this dispute goes on, the more will be spent. In total, the failure of management at Ordnance Survey Ireland to reinstate four workers, has cost the state in the region of £250,000. The remaining staff there, who yesterday staged strike action, have warned that unless the four workers are reinstated they will take further action.</P>
      <P>Such additional and prolonged action will not only cost the Exchequer more money, it will result in difficulties for those who depend on the work carried out by this agency. At a time when the demand for housing has never been so high, a reduced service by the Ordnance Survey Office will be damaging to the agencies and industries involved in housing provision such as planning, legal and construction services.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the problems obtaining at this office has been an internal report at the OSI which alleged that the four staff working in the retail section were engaged in financial and accountancy irregularities. On foot of the report, the four staff concerned were suspended, and over three years later they have yet to be reinstated. Although the staff in question have been vindicated by the Circuit Criminal Court, the management at the OSI has insisted that there is currently an internal investigation taking place into the matter and, therefore, it is not in a position to lift the suspension of the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot comprehend why this dispute is being allowed to continue and why the workers are still under suspension. The time has come for the Minister to intervene. He should examine the precise rationale for the continued suspension of the staff while an investigation takes place. In addition, he should examine the statements which were made at the individual sittings of the Circuit Criminal Court which cleared the staff of any wrongdoing. The Minister will be aware that a <Col N="237" /> Circuit Court judge described the management system at Ordnance Survey Ireland as a &ldquo;shambles&rdquo;. In addition, the internal audit which precipitated the suspension of the workers also found the management and administration to be inefficient, to say the least.</P>
    <P>It appears from the evidence in the public domain, that the four workers who have been cleared of any wrongdoing by the courts are paying the cost for ineffective administrative and management procedures at the office. Indeed, one judge said that if one of the cases he dealt with had been of a civil nature, he would not have hesitated to throw the claim out, award full costs and seek areas where punitive damages could be awarded.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is in the public interest and in the interests of the legal system, the construction industry and other agencies which depend on Ordnance Survey Ireland for the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency to avert any further action by the 200 staff at the Ordnance Survey Office and that the four workers, who have been under suspension for four years now and who have been cleared of any wrongdoing, are allowed to return to their place of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Deputy's contribution and, although it may not be his fault, some of what he said was inaccurate. I propose to outline the full facts of the case. The industrial action in Ordnance Survey Ireland is being taken by IMPACT members in support of four members of staff who are currently suspended from their duties. The Minister for Finance understands that the action consists mainly of withdrawal of co-operation with management and &ldquo;working to grade&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, a one day work stoppage also took place yesterday. This industrial action is in clear breach of normal procedures and the Minister has asked me to strongly urge IMPACT to call off the action at this stage to avoid further inconvenience to the organisation's customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies who have sought this debate may be aware, the staff at the heart of this dispute were suspended from their duties in February 1997 arising from an internal audit which brought to light certain irregularities in the handling of cash and cheques in the organisation. Following a subsequent Garda inquiry, criminal legal proceedings were initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a total of five staff members. I understand that one member of staff pleaded guilty to certain charges of fraud and larceny and was summarily tried and convicted in the District Court in January 1999. The remaining cases were before the criminal courts earlier this year. Two <Col N="238" /> of the cases were dismissed on the direction of the judge and the Director of Public Prosecutions entered a plea of <i>nolle prosequi</i> in the remaining two cases.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the criminal legal proceedings, three of the officers involved challenged the validity of their suspensions in the civil courts. However, the Supreme Court found in favour of Ordnance Survey Ireland. Following the completion of the criminal legal proceedings and acting on strong legal advice, the human resources manager of Ordnance Survey Ireland initiated an investigation under the Civil Service disciplinary code. On the basis of earlier legal advice, the disciplinary inquiry was not carried out at the time the officers were suspended in February 1997. The main reason for this was the concern at the time that the inquiry could have had the effect of prejudicing the outcome of the Garda investigation and possible criminal trials. The officers concerned have remained suspended from duty on two-thirds pay in mitigation of hardship since 21 February 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has asked me to point out that an investigation under the Civil Service disciplinary code is entirely separate from criminal legal proceedings. The relevant arrangements are set out in Department of Finance Circular 1/92 on procedures for dealing with grievance and disciplinary problems. These procedures have been agreed between representatives of the Department of Finance and all Civil Service unions, including IMPACT, under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service. They apply to all Departments and offices, including Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
    <P>The procedures provide that &ldquo;all matters of discipline shall be dealt with by management in a manner that protects the dignity of the employee and shall not be administered by management in the presence of other officers or the general public&rdquo; and &ldquo;all officers shall co-operate fully in the investigation of allegations&rdquo;. There are also considerable checks and balances in the procedures, including a right of appeal to an independent third party body, the disciplinary appeals board. This board comprises an independent chairperson and a representative of the Department of Finance and the Civil Service staff side.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has asked me to say that it is most unhelpful to have ongoing industrial action taking place because OSI management are fulfilling their obligation to carry out an investigation under the Civil Service disciplinary code. This dispute is not helping the process. Accordingly, I would urge the Deputies who sought the debate to use their good offices to persuade IMPACT to put their faith in the agreed procedures for dealing with the issues involved instead of adding to the difficulties through industrial action. The Minister for Finance has asked me to say that the OSI management remains <Col N="239" /> available for further discussions and he appeals to IMPACT to suspend the action immediately in order to allow such discussions to take place in an atmosphere which would be more conducive to finding a resolution to this dispute. I wholeheartedly endorse that request.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently being prepared to establish Ordnance Survey Ireland as a State body with a strong commercial focus. This is necessary because the organisation is facing an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment. Ordnance Survey Ireland will have to cope with many new challenges if it is to remain a key player in the rapidly evolving geographic information industry. Clearly, the management and staff of the organisation need to work very closely together to meet these challenges. The Minister feels that the current industrial action will not be conducive to the creation of the climate of co-operation and trust required to develop a flexible, dynamic and responsive organisation to meet existing and future business challenges.</P>
    <P>In light of this, the Minister has asked me to strongly urge IMPACT to take a longer term view of how the organisation might progress in the future, to suspend their industrial action and to put their faith in the agreed procedures for dealing with the cases of the four staff members who are currently suspended from duty. A continuation of the current industrial action is manifestly not in the interests of anybody associated with the organisation and the Minister strongly urges IMPACT to reflect carefully on the potential adverse consequences of the industrial action being undertaken by their members.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister has asked me to say that he hopes good sense will prevail and that this dispute can be resolved in order that Ordnance Survey Ireland can move on and develop strategies to meet the challenges awaiting the organisation in its new legislative and increasingly competitive environment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this debate tonight. While I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment, I feel it should not be necessary in our current economic climate to come into the Dáil to speak about an aspect of our health services which is effectively in a shambles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current state of our orthodontic service is beyond a disgrace. Our orthodontic services are <Col N="240" /> among the worst in Europe; in fact, from what I can see they hardly exist. It appears that amid the crisis in our health services, the state of our orthodontic services has worsened. As orthodontic treatments are not a life or death issue, they are simply not an issue for this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all parties will know that one of the most frequent representations by parents on behalf of their children concerns orthodontic services. In County Kerry alone, a total of 960 patients seeking fixed appliance treatment are now on waiting lists in Cork. So extensive is the waiting list in Cork that they are now only dealing with referrals made in January 1997. A further 546 children under the age of 12 years are awaiting assessment in Tralee. If they ever get an assessment in their childhood years, they will need to join a new waiting list for treatment because most of them will have reached their teenage years.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the consultants and nursing staff who are working flat out to deliver orthodontic treatments. However, the guidelines and criteria which govern the delivery of their services are outdated and simply no longer reflect demands. The Department of Health and Children guidelines on orthodontic services have not changed for 15 years. In spite of one of the key recommendations of the Moran report to use a more internationally accepted index for the delivery of these services, this Government has sat on its hands. As far as the treatment providers and those in need of treatment are concerned, the Moran report has sat gathering dust for too long. The report has been with the Minister and the Department for almost two years.</P>
    <P>The disgrace of our orthodontic services is a damning indictment of our tiger economy. Throughout Europe, even in countries less prosperous than ours, children do not have to queue for essential dental treatments but receive them as a right. Is this Government satisfied that Irish children must wait until their teenage years before they can wear a brace to rectify a problem which was clearly identifiable at the age of eight or nine years? Is this Government satisfied that hundreds of people are forced to live in major discomfort because they require new appliances for their teeth? Is this Government satisfied that the right to a healthy set of teeth is only available to those who can pay for such a service? I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question in the recent past. I am not satisfied that enough is being done to update the delivery of orthodontic services. It is crucial that the Minister takes responsibility for its delivery. Where is the Moran report in his Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Both Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and I have raised this matter, partic<Col N="241" /> ularly the current state of our orthodontic services, on a number of occasions. It is worsening despite the purported economic affluence we are supposed to enjoy. It is incredulous and mind-boggling to say that the severity of a child's orthodontic problems must conform with the Department's guidelines first introduced in 1985 which are clearly outdated and outmoded. If a young girl's dental outcrop is only eight instead of nine millimetres, she falls below the Department's guidelines for eligibility for treatment through the health board. Such young people in their formative years are desperately in need of treatment. There is an old adage, a stitch in time saves nine. Surely if the condition is not treated in time it worsens and young people, particularly girls, are acutely embarrassed at having pronounced outcrops. Parents, many of whom may be unemployed or in receipt of social welfare payments, borrow up to £2,000 from their local credit union in order to get appropriate appliances or other essential dental treatment. Otherwise their children remain in discomfort.</P>
      <P>Why has the recommendation to update these guidelines using a more internationally accepted index and the Moran report on the future of orthodontic services lain idle in the Department for over 18 months? I understand the senior chief executive officers of the health boards reported on all aspects of the matter so there is no further excuse for delay. I concur with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin that the orthodontic staff in the health boards are working flat out. The Midland Health Board is in crisis as far as orthodontic treatment and waiting lists are concerned. I appeal to the Minister to implement the recommendations of the Moran report without further delay and give hope to the young people on the waiting lists and their parents who must borrow to meet the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and allowing me an opportunity to discuss orthodontic services. This is not an issue of funding. It is simplistic to put forward such a view. Significant organisational changes must take place within the orthodontic service. I am concerned about the matter. The position is unacceptable and I intend to make changes and ensure services are in place.</P>
      <P>We will continue to develop orthodontic treatment services in accordance with the dental health action plan. My Department continues to provide funding to health boards for the development of the service. This year my Department made an additional £1,450,000 available to health boards for such development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand for orthodontics is much greater than can be provided in any developed country. The provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is expensive. It is important, therefore, <Col N="242" /> that resources be used efficiently. In that context, health boards must assess patients for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and, where appropriate, place individuals on waiting lists. The dental health action plan provides for the development of a consultant led orthodontic service by each health board which ensures a high level of high quality service. Seven of the boards have now established a consultant led service and the Midland Health Board avails of the services of orthodontists in private practice.</P>
    <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists assembled to prepare a report on orthodontic services. The objective of this review of the orthodontic services is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the provision of additional resources provided under the dental health action plan. The report was made to the chief executive officers of the health boards. Recommendations in the report include the following: that all boards use the same severity index to determine need, the internationally recognised index of treatment need, that resources be provided in this context and that provision of orthodontic treatment should be on the basis of priority need; that regional orthodontic units provide courses of continuing education to maintain and upgrade skills and standards; that dental schools continue to be involved in service provision as part of their training programmes in collaboration with the relevant health boards; that a standard model for costing orthodontic treatment be developed and implemented for each regional orthodontic unit; that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service; that regional orthodontic units be involved with the dental schools in the training of specialists on a rotational basis; that hygienists-auxiliaries be employed in the regional orthodontic units to complement the role of the specialists, provided that appropriate training and registration is facilitated; that existing dentists in the regional orthodontic units be provided with an opportunity of achieving specialised orthodontic qualifications and that a system of outcome measurement and audit be implemented in the orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>One of the main contributory factors that service targets are not being met in health board orthodontic units is that the majority of support staff available to consultants have been trainees and are, therefore, not capable of meeting the target levels appropriate to fully trained staff. Health boards are fully supportive of dentists who wish to pursue a specialist qualification in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> Specialist training programmes in orthodontics within the State are currently provided by the Dublin Dental Hospital and School. I have recently approved funding of £100,000 per annum to support the appointment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork Dental School so that priority can be given by the school to the provision of specialist training in orthodontics for health board dentists in the orthodontic units. It is essential that both schools have specialist training programmes available to dentists working with the orthodontic units. Full co-operation between the units and the schools will be required. Regrettably this co-operation has not always been achieved in times past. On the setting up of a specialist register it will ultimately be a matter for the Dental Council to satisfy itself as to the adequacy of training programmes for specialist registration.</P>
    <P>As yet there is no recognised grade of specialist orthodontist in the public health sector. Health boards experience a high turnover of staff in the units who reach specialist level owing to the attractiveness of private practice. However, in line with the recommendations of the Moran report, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, gave consent to the Dental Council for the speciality of orthodontics to be recognised for registration purposes. I am confident that with the setting up of a specialist register in orthodontics and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health service, a substantial improvement will be made in the recruitment and retention issues and, consequently, in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. The issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being progressed through the Health Services Employers Agency.</P>
    <P>The waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. We know that a delay does not mean there is a negative impact on a successful clinical outcome. Heath boards are committed to reducing waiting times over the next few years. I have asked the dental council to consider the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. This grade would act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have met all the chief executive officers of the health boards and asked them about their plans for cutting the waiting lists for orthodontics. I recently had two further meetings with the chief executive officer of the ERHA and his team in relation to orthodontics and the management team of the Southern Health Board, two regions that are particularly bad with regard to unacceptably long waiting lists. I put it to them in no uncertain terms that I want plans brought for<Col N="244" /> ward that will dramatically reduce waiting lists. In terms of the index, that will come into being shortly. It has gone on too long. It is time for reform and change, and that will happen.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I thank the Chair for choosing this matter for the Adjournment. The death by hanging last Thursday of a 31 year old man in his cell at Wheatfield prison is a tragedy. It is a tragedy for the individual who, at 31 years, should have a long, natural life and for the young man's grieving family in their loss of a loved one.</P>
      <P>The tragedy is put into proper perspective when one considers that while his offences, road traffic offences, must be taken seriously, they could not be classified in the serious criminal category. Yet the individual in question was so under pressure and emotionally disturbed that he felt compelled to make a calculated decision that there was nothing left to live for, that he could no longer cope with life, particularly prison life, and decided to end it.</P>
      <P>There are questions to be asked and answered. Was the prisoner medically and psychiatrically examined when he was committed to prison? Was he categorised in the at risk category? Was he in receipt of medical psychiatric treatment? How often was the prisoner checked in his cell? At what time was he last checked on Thursday when he died? How long after the last check-up in his cell was it before the deceased was discovered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental and core question and it is an essential one as regards the prison system. Should this individual have been serving a custodial sentence in the first place? Were his offences so serious in their nature that he could not have repaid whatever debt he owed society in a more productive and positive way. For example, could he have been, or should he not have been the subject of a community service order? Why do we not have a range of imaginative alternatives, particularly for non-serious custodial offences? We have the most expensive prison system in the world; it costs an average of £54,000 to keep a prisoner in jail for one year and we have more staff than prisoners. Yet we do not have a mission statement for what the prison system is supposed to achieve or deliver. The result is that the prison system is in chaos and it neither rehabilitates nor deters. Some prisoners get their first exposure to drugs in prison. Many prisons are infested with drugs and turn petty offenders into qualified criminals. It is a huge cesspool of hopelessness which drives individuals such as this unfortunate to ultimate despair and there seems to be no coherent strategy of rehabilitation to come to terms with the situation. The long promised Prisons Service Bill to establish a properly planned <Col N="245" /> Prisons Service on a statutory basis has been put on the long finger again. Last year was a record year for prison suicide, as six inmates, including a woman prisoner, took their own lives, while already this year there have been three prison suicides. On 21 April an inmate was stabbed to death in Mountjoy Prison, while earlier in the year a prison officer was seriously injured when he was set upon and stabbed by inmates in Limerick Prison.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there are major questions to answer about the management of Irish prisons. That has been evident for a long period, but those concerns have not been addressed adequately. The result is that people who should not die will continue to die.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every death in custody is a tragedy for the family, relatives and friends of the deceased and for the Prisons Service. Many people are traumatised by such events but none more so than the immediate family. I extend my sincere sympathy and condolences to them at the outset.</P>
      <P>The director general of the Irish prison service, who is responsible for all operational matters in relation to places of custody, has reported to me in this matter and provided the following details of this tragic death. The death occurred in Wheatfield Place of Detention last Thursday, 22 June 2000, at approximately 10 p.m. The person concerned had been sentenced on charges of assault and criminal damage to a motor vehicle to two terms of six months imprisonment in Mountjoy Prison, the sentences to run concurrently. He was transferred to Wheatfield Place of Detention on 12 April 2000 and was due for release with remission on the 18 August 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man was placed under special observation in Wheatfield; he was checked in his cell every 15 minutes from the beginning of his sentence. His medical history included psychiatric illnesses and he was seen by the psychiatric services in the prison at regular intervals since his arrival in Wheatfield, the last occasion being the day before his death. On the evening of 22 June, an officer spoke with him at 9.35 p.m. and he requested to speak to an assistant chief officer. The officer returned to him at 9.50 p.m. and informed him that the assistant chief officer would be with him soon. The assistant chief officer and a medical orderly reached the landing at 10 p.m. on routine rounds. They went to the man's cell at 10.05 p.m. When they opened the door to speak with him they found him slumped, in a seated position, at the window of the cell. His shoelaces were tied to the window catch and fashioned into a running noose. The officers immediately requested an ambulance and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They continued the resuscitation attempts until the arrival of the ambulance at 10.15 p.m. <Col N="246" /> He was taken to Tallaght Hospital at 10.25 p.m. where he was pronounced dead at 10.45 p.m.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal practice, the Garda was informed and its inquiry began immediately. As is usual, this death will be the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest. The circumstances of the death will also be examined by the suicide awareness group in Wheatfield. Members will be aware that there are long-standing procedures in place to prevent suicides in prison and many possible fatalities are prevented as a result of these procedures. Vigilance and care on the part of prison staff plays a vital role in preventing such deaths. In spite of our best efforts, we cannot escape the fact that where a person is determined to take his or her life the scope for prevention is limited. Suicide is not a completely preventable act in a free society or in a prison system which accords basic respect to the personal dignity of prisoners, for instance when using toilet or other facilities. The problem of suicide among troubled young men is well known and, sadly, this group are heavily represented in the offender and prison inmate population.</P>
    <P>The National Steering Group on Deaths in Prison will examine the circumstances of this case and will advise both me and the director general of the prison service of any additional measures which it considers appropriate to prevent further deaths in custody. I recently agreed to implementing the recommendation of the steering group that in-cell televisions should be available to all categories of offenders to counteract boredom during long lock-up periods. Governors of all prisons where televisions have been put in cells are reporting much reduced incidents of prisoner self-harm as a direct result of this.</P>
    <P>The director general has told me that he is fully committed to ensuring that all possible measures are in place to prevent deaths in our prisons. High support facilities are to be included in the new prisons and the provision of such facilities will also be examined in the context of the refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison. The establishment a pilot listening scheme in our prisons is also under examination. The Irish prison service has also established a national steering group on drug treatment for prisoners which the prisons' director general is chairing. Recruitment of extra staff for the probation and welfare and psychology services is also taking place. The psychiatric service for prisoners is being examined as part of the multi-disciplinary review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. The preventative measures in place to deter suicides are under continuous review. A research project on self harm and suicide in the Irish prison system has been recently drawn up which will result in further proposals for preventive strategies in relation to both self harm and suicide in custodial settings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> I assure the House that the Irish prison service will continue to refine its existing policies and to improve its procedures aimed at suicide prevention. I am committed to the risk reduction approach and staff at every level of the organis<Col N="248" /> ation will continue to do everything they can to prevent the occurrence of another tragic death in Wheatfield.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.08 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 June 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that these questions arose from recent remarks, which were partially reported in the media, made by the Information Commissioner at the press conference to launch the publication of his second annual report.</P>
      <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, the Minister for Finance has power to make regulations for the management and maintenance of records held by public bodies, following consultation with the Information Commissioner and the Director of the National Archives. I have no evidence that the standard of record keeping in public bodies overall has deteriorated. I will, however, be keeping the matter under review and I intend to arrange for the staff in my Department dealing with freedom of information to consult widely with public bodies in this regard. This process has already started.</P>
      <P>I should mention that prior to the introduction of the FOI Act in April 1998, a training course in best practice in records management was organised for all Departments by the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, in my Department, and a number of Departments took important initiatives to improve their record keeping systems. In addition, the importance of records management and the need for public bodies to keep adequate records is continually stressed to staff of public bodies attending FOI training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to make any staffing changes in my Department following publication of the second annual report of the Information Commissioner. However, a chapter entitled &ldquo;Some Lessons Learned&rdquo;, in which the Information Commissioner identifies areas where the handling of requests by some public bodies could be improved, has been circulated to all decision makers in my Department so as to inform their decision making practices under the FOI Act. I have also ensured that the key elements of the Information Commissioner's annual report have been brought to the attention of the interdepartmental working group and the public service users network, which exist to co-ordinate FOI implementation and share information and experience among public bodies. I am satisfied <Col N="251" /> that no specific staffing or organisational changes are warranted in my Department on foot of the Information Commissioner's annual report for 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 42 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland which relate to May show a year-on-year increase of 5.2 % in the Consumer Price Index, CPI. Inflation is 5.1 % on the basis of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP. This compares with 1.9 % for the Euro-11.</P>
      <P>The inflation rate is now much higher than had been expected, and represents a disappointment to the Government. I expect a further uptake in inflation in the short-term because of recent energy price developments and the recent increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank. However, as once-off and external factors become less important inflation will begin to fall, although the timing of this decline will depend, to a large extent, on developments in our exchange rate and the price of oil.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, I am confident that this period of higher than expected inflation will prove to be temporary and that improvements in public service provision envisaged over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will not be compromised.</P>
      <P>In order to sustain our competitiveness and economic prospects it is essential that Irish costs do not rise at a faster rate than our main trading partners unless matched by faster productivity growth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has mandated the Department of the Environment and Local Government to prepare a national spatial strategy which will translate the broad approach to regional development in the national development plan into a more detailed framework for spatial development in the longer term. Direct responsibility for the national spatial strategy, therefore, resides with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In the document entitled &ldquo;National Spatial Strategy: Scope and Delivery&rdquo; which was recently published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and distributed to Members of this House, that Department indicated that the national spatial strategy will identify broad spatial development patterns for all areas of the country and set down indicative policies in relation to the location of industrial development, residential development, services, rural development, tourism and heritage. It will also develop and present a dynamic conception of the Irish urban system, together with its links to rural areas, which recognises and utilises their economic and social interdependence. The strategy will be completed by the end of 2001 and will have a 20 year time horizon.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental steering committee comprising representation from all relevant Departments, including my own Department, has been established to lead and oversee the development of the strategy at policy level. My Department has a major interest in the formulation of the national spatial strategy because of the interaction between it and the evolution of the economy over the longer-term and, in particular, over the period of the national development plan. The national spatial strategy cannot be developed in a vacuum but will need to take account of current and likely future trends in the economy generally. Moreover, the strategy itself will also influence the nature and location of economic activity, a factor which will have implications for economic and budgetary management.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the role of my Department in relation to the national spatial strategy will include advising the steering committee on the longer term macroeconomic framework within which the strategy will be articulated and representing to the committee the Department's views on the various issues that are likely to arise as the development of the strategy progresses.</P>
      <P>I look forward to my Department actively contributing to the formulation of the national spatial strategy.</P>

However, my Department is already engaged in discussions with the public service unions with a view to establishing the body early, before the autumn, and asking it to report by autumn 2002. This acceleration of the process reflects the complexity of the task which the body is being asked to undertake and the need to allow time for the implementation of its recommendations to be considered by the parties and discussed in the context of any successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>When the end-march Exchequer figures were published, I indicated that, based on trends to that point, tax revenue for the year as a whole could exceed the budget target by as much as £500 million. The expenditure figures at that time appeared low, but that was due mainly to timing factors. The first quarter figures indicated that the public finances were well on target for the year.</P>

      <P>The monitoring of growth of private sector credit in Ireland and prudential regulation of credit institutions in general is a matter for the Central Bank and I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in such regulation.</P>
      <P>The 1999 annual report of the bank states, at page 10, that in the light of the continuing high level of growth in lending to the private sector and the unprecedented scale of increase in asset prices, the primary focus of banking supervision remains on credit risk. The report adds that the Central Bank is monitoring lending practices carefully and that particular attention is being given to the ability of credit institutions to adjust to changes in market conditions.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in the past, the growth in credit reflects Ireland's economic and employment growth which has been a multiple of that in our EU partners &ndash; over the last five years real growth in the Irish economy has averaged 9% per annum compared with 2.2% in the Euro 11 area. In the same period, Irish employment grew by an average of almost 4.8% per annum compared with 0.8% in the Euro 11 area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Heritage Council's submission and its expression of support for the Government in successfully achieving the objectives of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>A basic objective of the strategy and investment proposals set out in the national development plan is to secure sustainable economic and social development while striking the correct balance between protecting and preserving the environment, promoting economic and employment growth, improving competitiveness and addressing social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan itself contains an analysis of the environmental situation in Ireland and, in line with Government's policy to introduce eco-auditing of policies in specific sectoral areas and of <Col N="256" /> national development plans, the plan was the subject of a pilot eco-audit. Details of this pilot ECO audit are set out in appendix 4 of the plan. The chapters in the plan dealing with the various operational programmes contain a summary of how they will impact on the environment as well as on equal opportunity, poverty and rural development.</P>
    <P>At an operational level, the plan provides that the environment and these other horizontal concerns will, where feasible, be included in the development of all project selection criteria, performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Furthermore, pilot eco-audits will be included in each of the operational programmes and the views of Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, have also been sought on the operational programmes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Following a number of meetings of both the ECOFIN Council and the European Council in Feira on 18 to 20 June 2000, an agreement was reached on how to progress matters in relation to the draft savings directive. It has been agreed that, as set out in the Helsinki European Council Conclusions, all citizens resident in a member state should pay the tax due on all their savings income and that in order to achieve that outcome, exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible shall be the ultimate objective of the EU in line with international developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the immediate future, all member states have committed to achieving agreement during the French Presidency, which runs for six months from July, on the substantial content of the directive. During 2001 and 2002 the issue of the adoption of equivalent measures by the US and key <Col N="257" /> third countries will be pursued by the Presidency and the Commission and member states will promote the adoption of the same measures in all relevant dependent or associated territories.</P>
    <P>Once sufficient reassurances with regard to the application of the same measures in dependent or associated territories and of equivalent measures in the US and key third countries have been obtained, and on the basis of a report, the Council will decide on the adoption and implementation of the directive no later than 31 December 2002, and do so by unanimity.</P>
    <P>When the directive is adopted, member states may operate a withholding tax for a transitional period but must agree to implement exchange of information as soon as conditions permit and in any case no later than seven years after the entry into force of the directive. Those countries that opt to operate a withholding tax regime agree to transfer an appropriate share of their revenue to the investor's state of residence. This provision is to accommodate a minority of member states which will be unable to move immediately at that time to an exchange of information. Ireland, along with the majority of member states had indicated that it will not need to avail of this transitional option.</P>
    <P>While the outcome of the discussion at Feira on the savings tax is to be welcomed, it is important to note that the detailed work on the various substantial outstanding issues will have to be pursued during the coming months. This work will be pursued in parallel with the other elements of the tax package, i.e. the code of conduct, business taxation, and the draft directive on interest and royalties.</P>

It is not possible at this stage to make any reliable estimation as to when the investigations will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the investigations cover events from the 1970s onwards. In the present phase of the work all available information is being collated. The investigations cover not only the names identified in the report of the authorised officer but also associated persons and trusts. In the course of their work, the Revenue investigators are using, where appropriate, all available powers including new powers included in the 1999 Finance Act. As part of this, infor<Col N="258" /> mation is being obtained from financial institutions and others under High Court orders.</P>

    <P>Since June 1997, there has been a substantial improvement in the representation of women at principal level. As of 31 March 2000, there were six women principals in my Department, representing 12% of the officers in that grade. The percentage of women serving as assistant principal had also risen by 31 March 2000, to 24%. To facilitate the balancing of career and family commitments, the Department has granted job-sharing to all who have requested it at principal and assistant principal levels; as of 31 March 2000, there were four principals, three women and one man, and five assistant principals, all women, job-sharing.</P>
    <P>In relation to family friendly initiatives, my Department is participating for the first time this year in a pilot scheme of term time working for summer 2000, which enables staff with young families or dependent relatives to be given unpaid leave for up to 13 weeks in the summer months. Eleven applications were received, two from assistant principals, both women, and all applications were granted.</P>
    <P>The setting of further specific goals and targets is being considered in the context of this year's review of my Department's strategy statement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are several factors behind the increase in inflation. These include the weakness of the euro, the upward trend in oil prices, the increase in excise duties on tobacco, higher inflation in the services sector and the ongoing increases in alcohol prices.</P>
      <P>There is realisation that within EMU cyclical differences between member states may emerge leading to temporary differences in inflation rates. However, national governments remain responsible for other economic policy matters, such as budgetary and structural policies which can affect price developments. In this respect we are taking the necessary steps to tackle inflation, most notably in relation to measures which aim to boost competition.</P>
      <P>I am confident that over time inflation will begin to converge towards the EU average. This is essential if we are maintain our competitiveness and sustain economic growth.</P>

      <P>Mr O'Flaherty has informed me in writing that it is his intention, on his appointment, to forego his judicial pension for the duration of the appointment in question.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it would be appropriate to &ldquo;gift&rdquo;  the pension to the Minister for Finance, that is, to the Exchequer. From a procedural point it would be appropriate for him to sign a mandate addressed to the Paymaster General sanctioning the surrender of the pension until further notice. The Revenue Commissioners would also have to be contacted and the appropriate forms completed to enable a PAYE exclusion order be issued.</P>
      <P>Section 483 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act provides a relief from income tax or corporation tax in respect of gifts of money accepted by the Minister for Finance for use by the Minister for any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided.</P>
      <P>Where the Minister accepts a gift for the purposes of section 483, then tax relief is given on the gift by deducting the amount of the gift from the individual's total income before calculating the tax due. If the gift consisted of the return of a state pension, the individual's chargeable income for the tax year, including the pension, would be reduced by the amount of the gift. In effect, from an income tax point of view, the person would be in the same position as if they had not received the income.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 20 June last the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts carried out a full review of the progress made to date in relation to the recommendations contained in their report into DIRT. The sub-committee is to have a further meeting on 11 July next in relation to a number of specific issues. A specially established group in my Department is pursuing on an ongoing basis the progress of the full range of recommendations, in so far as my Department has direct responsibility. I will outline for the Deputy, the up to date position of the main recommendations contained in this report which my Department has direct responsibility for.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 2000, implemented a number of recommendations made by the sub-committee in relation to the audit powers of the Revenue Commissioners, the reporting by Revenue to the Public Accounts Committee on the results of the DIRT look-back audit currently under way and the appointment by Revenue of outside auditors. In addition, the Act provides for the enhancement of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to publish settlements.</P>
      <P>A small number of the recommendations of the report could not be implemented in the Finance Act for legal reasons. The Attorney General advised that there would be difficulties in making provision to implement a limited number of the recommendations of the sub-committee where this would involve the retrospective introduction of penalties. This advice is founded on Article 15.5 of the Constitution which prohibits retroactive penal legislation. The Attorney General also advised that there would be difficulties in introducing a provision which would affect a narrow class of taxpayer, that is, DIRT inquiry financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee also recommended that the public service management and development division of the Department of Finance carry out a general review of the Revenue Commissioners which should address the issues of independence and accountability, organisation, structures and practices and the desirability or otherwise of executive and non-executive commissioners on the board of revenue and report back to the Public Accounts Committee within six months.</P>
      <P>The centre for management and organisation development of my Department is currently carrying out the review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners within the terms of reference as recommended by the sub-committee. The review is being overseen by a high-level steering group which includes two external experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Good progress has been made on the review and my Department worked to complete it within the specified six month period. However given the very wide scope of the review and the complexity of some of the issues being addressed, it has not been possible to meet that timetable. A target date of end July is now envisaged for completing the review.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of financial regulation and the role of the Central Bank, the sub-committee made a number of recommendations which are designed to promote the highest standards of corporate governance, probity and transparency in the financial services industry. Both I and the Central Bank have welcomed these proposals. It is my intention, when bringing forward proposals for the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector, that the legislation will incorporate appropriate provisions based upon these recommendations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Central Bank has requested all credit institutions to submit their internal codes of ethical practice so that an assessment can be made as to whether further action is required. The bank has also recently been proactive by amending its licensing and supervision requirements and standards by requesting that a report be provided to the boards of credit institutions at least annually on compliance with national and EU laws and international regulations.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee also recommended that, as soon as is feasible, legislation be prepared so that the resource represented by funds in dormant accounts may be used for specified purposes of societal and community benefit. As the Deputy will be aware from replies to other questions on this topic today, this issue is being addressed.</P>
    <P>A recommendation was also made by the sub-committee concerning the possible conflict of interest where civil servants resign in order to take up employment elsewhere. The draft code of standards and behaviour for civil servants was recently finalised by the implementation group of secretaries general of the SMI and I am currently considering it.</P>
    <P>A draft memorandum for Government on the code is being prepared by my Department and will issue to Departments for their observations in the near future. The draft code will then be brought before the Government for approval, following which the consultative process with the Civil Service unions will commence.</P>
    <P>Last June in response to a parliamentary question from Deputy John Bruton, I also gave a commitment in this House that the draft code would be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service for its consideration.</P>
    <P>Following these consultation processes any changes to the code will be resubmitted to the Government for approval prior to the promulgation of the code in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The majority of the recommendations concerning parliamentary issues are matters for decision by the Government. Other recommendations are <Col N="265" /> for the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves. Some of these recommendations have constitutional and legal implications and the Attorney General provided advice as appropriate in the past week. The Department is currently preparing a composite response to these particular recommendations for my consideration. The intention is that the composite response will be completed in the early autumn and will be submitted to Government for approval.</P>

      <P>Following the abandonment of the ACC-TSB merger-flotation, I indicated to the TSB that existing ownership arrangements would not be sustainable in the long run and that a change in the ownership structure was necessary to secure the long-term future of the bank. In that context, my Department informed the TSB that any process leading to a change in ownership has to be carried out in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. It was also suggested that the bank should make arrangements to ensure that the public interest in the process be addressed.</P>
      <P>The trustees of TSB bank, with my full support, announced on the 28 March that they were inviting proposals in relation to the future of the bank. When this process is completed, I would expect to receive a formal request from the trustees to approve new arrangements. I will give any formal request to approve new arrangements my full consideration upon receipt and then bring it to Government. An order under section 57 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, which would have to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas, would be required to authorise any reorganisation of the TSB.</P>

      <P>I am happy to make a statement on the substantial progress that has been made in implementing the pilot PPP process since I announced, on 1 June 1999, the list of pathfinder projects selected to pilot the PPP process in Ireland. The relevant Departments and the National Roads Authority are bringing these projects to the delivery stage on schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made on the ambitious programme set for the delivery of the <Col N="266" /> pilot PPP roads projects. The National Roads Authority has engaged legal consultants and is in the process of engaging financial and technical consultants to assist in the procurement of the pilot projects. The NRA is aiming to seek tenders for the Waterford scheme in late 2000 and the Limerick scheme in mid 2001. In the case of the M50-West Link second bridge scheme, I am informed that negotiations between National Toll Roads, NTR, and the National Roads Authority on a design, build, finance and operate scheme have concluded. Construction is due to commence in early 2001. In relation to the potential Kilcock-Kinnegad project under a DBFO scheme, I have been informed that a route selection report is nearing completion and that it is intended to seek tenders in late 2000.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has also made significant progress in relation to its pilot projects. The redevelopment of the Cork School of Music, was announced by the Minister for Education and Science on 18 October 1999 and a package of five pilot second level schools has also been selected. The Department of Education and Science has engaged advisors to assist in the delivery of these projects. I understand that an invitation to tender for these projects is imminent.</P>
    <P>In relation to water supply, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has given approval to two local authorities to appoint client representatives for the development of two water supply pilot projects at Ballymore Eustace and Clareville in Limerick on a design, build, operate and finance basis. The appointment process is at an advanced stage. Also, work is continuing on PPP projects in the water supply area which do not involve private finance such as waste water treatment facilities in Dublin and Cork. In the solid waste area a thermal treatment plant in Dublin has recently been selected as a pilot design, build, operate and finance scheme. Client representatives for the project are being sought. More generally, consultants appointed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to look at legal, financial, technical and other issues on their specific pilot project areas finalised their report in May 2000. This report includes detailed guidance and advice which local authorities and the National Roads Authority can use in the selection of projects, the management of the process and other actions to facilitate the implementation of PPP projects. This is another important stage in the development of the PPP process in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin light rail project, initial preparatory construction work for the Tallaght line has begun. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, has obtained Government approval for a PPP approach to the operation of the project. The Department of Public Enterprise is in the process of appointing consultants to conduct a competition for the award of the operating franchise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> As well as bringing pilot projects to market, further projects are being identified for possible implementation as PPPs. The relocation of the Dublin Institute of Technology to the Grangegorman site is being examined as a potential PPP project. In addition an announcement of a further tranche of PPP roads projects by the National Roads Authority is imminent. A PPP approach is to be adopted for the National Maritime College and there is a commitment in principle to examining the feasibility of using a PPP approach for suitable facilities in the health sector. The use of PPP in other areas is also being considered.</P>
    <P>Finally, the structures put in place to forward the process are working well. Departments are developing their skills and knowledge base in the PPP area. The importance of training is also recognised and a programme to increase awareness in and the skills available to the public service is being developed. Within the public sector, progress is being made on key issues, both within individual Departments and under the aegis of the interdepartmental PPP group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, section 478 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act, formerly section 5 of the 1996 Finance Act, introduced a tax relief in respect of the purchase and-or installation of house alarm systems for persons aged 65 years and over and living alone. The legislation provided specifically that the tax relief would only be available for the period 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998. The tax relief was allowed to lapse in part because of the small numbers of claims being submitted and I have no plans to reintroduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the scheme of social community support for older people has been in operation since 1996. The scheme, run by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, provides funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have under<Col N="269" /> taken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand that a total of £17 million has been allocated to this scheme and 70,000 people have benefited since the scheme began in 1996. This year £5 million pounds has been provided in the Estimates volume for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the cost of small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm which is operated<i> via</i> the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>

      <P>My Department is in continuing contact with the administrator of Icarom plc, formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, with regard to the repayment of the loan of £100 million, which was made to the administrator in 1985 and which is due for repayment in September 2000. As I have previously indicated to the House, this repayable advance was provided by way of a loan to the Minister for Finance from the Central Bank which was funded in turn by a deposit of £70 million placed by AIB with the Central Bank and £30 million of the Central Bank's own resources. When the administrator repays the £100 million loan in September 2000 to the insurance compensation fund, the fund will in turn repay the Exchequer, which will in turn repay the Central Bank. The Central Bank will then repay Allied Irish Banks the £70 million deposit which AIB placed with the Central Bank in 1985 for a period of 15 years. There are no other payments to any other company or body in respect of the £100 million loan.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the administrator will be in a position to meet the £100 million repayment in September 2000 without any further recourse to the Exchequer. The repayment of the £100 million loan in September 2000 will effectively end the arrangements which were put in place in 1985 for the funding of the High Court administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. It does not affect the additional funding arrangements which were put in place in 1992 and which provided for an interest-free loan of £32 million from the Exchequer, which is repayable not later than 2012 and for an annual contribution of £8.8 million from Allied Irish Banks for each of the 20 years up to 2012.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 37 of 23 May 2000, I said that one of the factors behind the recent increase in inflation is an increase in underlying domestic inflation. Domestic inflation can be defined as price increases in areas such as services and related expenditure and alcoholic drinks where external influences such as import prices are not significant.</P>
      <P>In the year to May 2000 alcohol prices increased by 5% while prices in the services sector rose by 6.4%. These price increases reflect either higher profit margins or higher input costs such as the cost of labour. Current information on the importance of these factors is not available. Our best assessment is that wages costs are increasing due to the tightness of the labour market and that these increases are adding to domestic inflation. Excessive profit margins in some sectors is also a contributing factor.</P>
      <P>A full breakdown of the different components of the CPI follows, for information.</P>
      <P>As regards the policy response, the best way to tackle domestic inflation is to improve competition where possible. Imbalances in the labour market which are fuelling wage increases must also be addressed.</P>
      <P>Food prices rose by 1.3% in May, bringing the annual percentage change in the year to May to 3.2%. Price increases were recorded for lamb, poultry, potatoes and fresh vegetables, soft drinks, sweets and chocolates while the price of tomatoes and yoghurt fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcoholic drink prices rose by 1.2% in the month with increases across the board. The annual percentage increase fell marginally to 5.0%, contributing +0.65% to the overall annual <Col N="272" /> consumer price index in the twelve months to May.</P>
    <P>Cigarettes and related tobacco prices rose by 1.4% in May following the introduction of a general trade price increase. The annual increase in the 12 months to May was 17.1%.</P>
    <P>Clothing and Footwear prices remained stable in May.</P>
    <P>Fuel and light costs fell in May following a reduction in the cost of home heating oil. The annual percentage increase in the year to May has dropped significantly to 38% having reached a high of 62% in March.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing increased by 2.2% in May. This was due to an increase in the cost of private rented accommodation and increases in mortgage interest repayments.</P>
    <P>Durable goods prices rose marginally in May by 0.2%. There were increases in the cost of furniture and soft furnishings while the prices of crockery and glassware, cutlery and acoustic appliances fell.</P>
    <P>Other goods increased by 0.5% in May following increases in the prices of comics, magazines and books, paper products such as toilet paper and kitchen paper, detergents and cleaning equipment, cosmetics and hair applications.</P>
    <P>Transport costs fell by 0.5% in May following a fall in the price of motor fuels and air and boat fares, while the cost of motor insurance rose marginally. The annual percentage increase in the year to May was 8.3% down from 9.9% in the previous month.</P>
    <P>Services and related expenditure rose marginally in May by 0.4% with increases in doctors and dentists fees, hairdressing charges, entertainment, education and training while telephone charges fell.</P>
    <P>Consumer prices increased by 0.7% in May to bring the overall CPI to 110.1. This compares to an increase of 0.5% in May 1999. As a result, annual inflation in the twelve months to May was 5.2% compared to 4.9% in April 2000. The main factors causing the monthly increase were increased mortgage payments, higher private rental costs and increases in food, tobacco and alcohol prices.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="276" /> Deputy will be aware that the schemes to which he refers are constituent elements of the national development plan under which the agriculture, food and rural development areas have been allocated substantial Exchequer and EU funding over the seven year period 2000-06. The funding relates essentially to measures for farmers and the food processing sector. The following table gives full details, including specific figures for the schemes mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> As regards progress under the NDP, the position is that negotiations with the European Commission on the Community Support Framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds have recently been completed and the various operational programmes required have been finalised and submitted to the European Commission. As commission approval is required before funding can be drawn down, the allocations listed below can not be spent until such approval has been given. There is therefore no question of my Department withholding the necessary finance for the updating and implementation of the new schemes &ndash; the funding has been agreed, is in place, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are in a position to spend it as soon as European Commission approval is received.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give the projected percentage pay increases for public sector workers and private sector workers for 2000, exclusive of any tax changes; the way in which these compare with the current rate of inflation; his views on warnings from trade union leaders that the current level of inflation was threatening social partnership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>For 2000 the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provides for an increase of 5.5% in basic pay in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Taking account of pay drift, my Department estimates that overall <i>per capita </i>private sector earnings are likely to increase by about 6.5% in 2000 &ndash; higher than the recently published inflation rate of 5.2%. When reductions in taxes are included increases in nominal take-home pay may range up to 14% depending on income levels.</P>
      <P>The projected pay rate increases in the public service in 2000 are 1% from 1 April, the final phase of Partnership 2000, 5.5 % from 1 October being the first phase of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and 3% for certain groups who qualify for the early settlers deal. These pre-tax increases also exceed the current rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The Government is concerned about the possible impact of higher inflation on social partnership and economic progress. Wide ranging measures in relation to housing have been announced. Significant resources have been committed to the Competition Authority, to enable it to tackle evidence of anti-competitive activity and profiteering in sheltered sectors of the economy. Further measures will be announced shortly.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether only a small number of disabled drivers are able to take advantage of the disabled drivers tax concession scheme; when the interdepartmental group reviewing the scheme was established; when it is expected to report; and if he will extend the scheme to cover the very many disabled people who cannot avail of the current scheme.</Quest>

      <P>The number of beneficiaries under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme is in the region of 5,400. The cost of relief in 1999 was £17 million, as compared to £4 million in 1994, which shows that the scheme is being used extensively by those who qualify. There are up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Not all of these would wish to drive or be able to drive.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group was established in April 1998 under the chair of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope to receive their report later in the year. Pending receipt of the report, I do not consider it prudent to make further comment on the scheme.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to a somewhat similar question on 23 May last, the Government at its meeting on 11 April 2000 approved my proposals to engage in consultations with the financial services industry in relation to the dormant accounts issue and, in this regard, the following bodies have been consulted: Irish Bankers' Federation, IBF; Irish Insurance Federation, IIF; Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, IMSA; Irish Association of Investment Managers, IAIM; Financial Services Industry Association, FSIA; An Post; NTMA and the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>These consultations have now concluded and my officials have presented a report of their findings to me. The position now is that, following consultation with relevant Departments, a memorandum for Government together with the draft heads of a Bill will be submitted to Government for approval.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year costs to the Exchequer, by reference to the income tax year 2000-01, of the changes mentioned by the Deputy, are estimated as follows.</P>
      <P>From April 2001, with the move to a full tax credits system, the standard rated personal and PAYE allowances will be converted into tax credits. If the personal allowances for single and widowed persons were increased so that the combined total of the single allowance and PAYE allowance was equal to the level of the minimum wage, based on earnings of £4.40 per hour over an assumed standard 39 hour week and with a pro rata increase of double that amount for married persons, the cost would be of the order of £1,050 million. If the PAYE allowance alone was increased to this level, the cost would be in the region of £730 million; this is less costly as self-employed persons and their spouses are not entitled to avail of this allowance and, in addition, the allowance is not doubled for a married one earner couple. The objective of exempting the minimum wage from taxation could also be achieved by increasing the general income tax exemption limit at an estimated cost of approximately £305 million. However, as I stated during Private Members' time in the Seanad on 12 April 2000, &ldquo;this would put an enormous number of people back into the marginal relief system where the marginal tax rate is 40% and would exacerbate the problems of poverty and employment traps for those wishing to return to work or earn more income . . . We do not want to go down that route again&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Reduction of the standard rate of income tax from 22% to 21% would cost approximately £115 million in a full year and a reduction of the 44% rate of income tax to 43% would cost approximately £70 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The cost of the second phase of the programme to individualise the standard rate bands will depend on the precise increases in the bands which are announced in the next budget. For illustration purposes, if the band for single persons is increased from £17,000 to £22,000 and from £34,000 to £44,000 for two income married couples, subject to transferability of individual bands between spouses up to a maximum band of £28,000 for either spouse, the cost to the Exchequer in a full year is currently estimated at £310 million.</P>
      <P>These figures are provisional and are likely to be revised.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the number of tax audits have fallen from 1 in 80 in 1995 to 1 in 153 in 2000; the plans he has to provide additional staff or resources for the audit section of the Revenue Commissioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the ratios quoted seem to be based on the most intensive type of audit, referred to as comprehensive audit. Revenue consider that it is more appropriate to look at the totality of the audit programmes comprising all forms of audit activity.</P>
      <P>On this basis, there has been a reduction in the total number of tax audits, excluding capital tax audits, from about 23,000 in 1995 to about 17,000 in 1999. Taking a ratio of the number of audits completed in comparison with the number of self-assessed taxpayers, the figures show a reduction from a ratio of about one in 14 to about one in 22.</P>
      <P>Reasons for the reduction in the actual numbers of audits carried out include the following: there has been a change in the variety of audits carried out. Fewer VAT and PAYE audits were carried out in 1999 as compared with 1995; training was provided in 1998 and 1999 for 160 auditors as part of a restructuring agreement finalised in 1998 and this reduced availability for audit work and auditors were transferred at various times during 1999 to special project work connected with the various tribunals of inquiry, the DIRT look-back audits and the Ansbacher investigation.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the significant increase in the number of taxpayers registered for tax, I have authorised a very substantial increase in the number of Revenue staff. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have in mind to allocate 155 extra staff for audit and investigative work but implementation of this has been delayed because of issues raised by the trade union representing staff, which are the subject of discussion.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria determining eligibility for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme are set out in Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994, copies of which are available in the Library. Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. Visual disability is not one of the qualifying disabilities. The scheme targets, what are very generous tax reliefs, at those persons who are severely and permanently handicapped with regard to physical mobility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy is well aware, the scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group under the chair of an official <Col N="282" /> of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria, and I hope to receive their report later in the year.</P>

      <P>In consideration of the commitments given in Partnership 2000, paragraph 5.11, a pilot time use survey was carried out by the CSO in June 1997. A full time use survey is needed to provide information on the quantum of unpaid work undertaken. A report on the outcome of the pilot survey was published in July 1999. This showed that conducting a full survey would be feasible but that it would be a major undertaking requiring considerable financing. In addition, a number of technical issues were raised that would require further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, section 2.1.10, NESC will be requested to consider the development of a framework by June 2001 to bring into operation national progress indicators to measure economic, social and environmental development. This will encompass the availability and use of new forms of data sources, including time <Col N="286" /> use surveys, national household accounts and national satellite accounts.</P>

      <Quest> the reason Statutory Instrument 146 of 2000 has not been implemented during the recent train strike; the reason she signed this instrument if its provisions are not being implemented; the meaning of registered trade union as defined in this instrument; if the breakaway union, Irish Locomotive Drivers Association, is a registered union; the reason dialogue over these individual grievances has not been entered into in accordance with the code of practice; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The new code of practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedure &ndash; SI No. 146 of 2000 &ndash; updated and replaced a previous Code of Practice on Disciplinary Procedures SI No. 117 of 1996.</P>
      <P>This new code was prepared by the Labour Relations Commission following the report of the high level group. This group was established under paragraph 9.22 of Partnership 2000 to consider detailed proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain. The report clearly outlined that its recommendations on this new code were in the context of individual representation.</P>
      <P>The new code is not meant to deal with collective disputes which are covered by the code of practice on dispute procedures.</P>
      <P>In a recent High Court case between Irish Rail and the ILDA and named members of that association, Mr. Justice O'Neill concluded that it is not lawful for the ILDA to negotiate on the fixing of rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service of locomotive drivers. There are two trade unions recognised by Irish Rail to represent locomotive drivers, SIPTU and NBRU.</P>
      <P>A trade union is defined in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, as a trade union which is the holder of a negotiation licence under Part II of the Trade Union Act, 1941.</P>
      <P>Registration of a trade union can be made with the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Trade Union Act, 1871, but registration does not confer negotiating rights. The ILDA has registered as a trade union but does not have a negotiating licence.</P>
      <P>The ILDA referred a number of issues to the LRC which were all collective issues. None of them could be regarded as appropriate to the code of practice of grievance and disciplinary procedures which was designed in the context of individual representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, made a statement on this dispute in the House on 20 June. In that statement she referred to the significant benefits of the new agreement which has been accepted by a majority of drivers of the two recognised trade unions, SIPTU and NBRU. I support her call to those drivers who have not co-operated with the new rosters to reconsider the substantial benefits <Col N="301" /> of the total package which was negotiated on their behalf.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> if she will make a statement on the latest figures published by the International Labour Organisation contained in the world labour report and, in particular, the participation rates of the 15 to 24 age bracket </Quest>
      <QRef>[18190/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Labour Organisation publication entitled Key Indicators of the Labour Market 1999 highlights,<i> inter alia, </i>participation rates for the working age population. In the case of 15 to 24 year olds for Ireland, it shows that the labour force participation rate has declined for this group from 60.0% in 1980, to 50.4% in 1990, and 45.5% in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased educational participation has been a key factor which has influenced labour market trends in youth participation rates. The significant increase in total numbers of young persons engaged in education is an extremely positive outcome given the strong correlation between educational attainment and labour market success. Research confirms, as do the annual second-level school leavers' surveys published by my Department, that employment increases with higher educational attainment. In addition, as shown by the most recent 1998 school leaver survey, the unemployment rate of those with no qualifications are five to seven times higher than school leavers who have attained the leaving certificate. On a further positive note, the survey charts the substantial increase in the proportion of school leavers opting to delay their entry into the labour market and continue further studies. This proportion has progressively increased over <Col N="316" /> the period since the 1980s, rising from 21% in 1980 to approximately 39% in 1998.</P>
    <P>Thus, in line with greater educational retention, labour market participation rates have declined. This is a very positive aspect for the individuals concerned and for the Irish labour market given the need for a highly educated workforce to meet the needs of a modern well-developed economy.</P>

      <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC, has made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, including one on the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
      <P>In the report, a majority of the review group recommended that the groceries order be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am considering the report and I am also aware of the strong views on each side of the argument held by various groups, commercial and other on this matter. In my deliberations, I will be considering among other matters, whether there is sufficient competition in the market and what measures would prevent any one player, or group of players acting in concert, achieving a <Col N="317" /> dominant position that would leave consumers or suppliers open to exploitation. I intend to consult all interested parties and when I have heard their views I will make my decision.</P>
    <P>In the interim, the order remains in force.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the widespread concern of people in the south-east region regarding the inadequate manufacturing business in the region and the failure to implement the policy of regional dispersal of inward investment to locations especially in County Kilkenny; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities throughout the country. The industrial development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this focus.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has carried out an extensive analysis to determine the needs of the different regions and to identify the industrial sectors most likely to deliver quality jobs. The main aim of the agency's activity is to try to increase the share of new greenfield projects locating in the regions in order to achieve its regional impact.</P>
      <P>However, it is not merely a question of jobs dispersal, the agency is seeking to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of the modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,255 new jobs in four IDA Ireland supported companies were announced during 1999 for this region. These jobs have already started to come on stream and are adding significantly to the base of employment in the 81 IDA Ireland supported companies which already employ nearly 10,000 companies. IDA Ireland's marketing focus for new greenfield projects for the region is on the key sectors of information and communications technology, ICT, pharmaceuticals and internationally traded services.</P>
      <P>A key element of IDA Ireland's strategy is to ensure the provision of high quality office and business parks and buildings in all the larger towns by working closely with the local authorities and private sector investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kilkenny city, this strategy is showing results in that a new 43 acre prestigious business and technology park has been developed by the agency with two advance buildings completed which are being actively promoted. The industrial development agencies are also promoting the for<Col N="318" /> mer envelopes factory in Thomastown for industrial development.</P>
    <P>New properties have also been provided in other counties in the region. A new technology park has been developed in Waterford city in addition to the ongoing provision of quality offices and manufacturing buildings on the existing IDA Ireland industrial park. The Belview strategic site is also being promoted for industrial development. The availability of such facilities are deemed essential to the attraction of industry to an area.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also committed to assisting industrial development in the region. In addition to working with its core client base, the agency works closely with all development organisations and other industry in the area. This facilitates an integrated approach to development in the region.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will also help to underpin IDA Ireland's regional strategy since it will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, through its industrial development agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities throughout the country. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In this regard, the Border region, including Cavan, is a particular priority location for promotional purposes by the agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> The EU Commission has recognised the needs of the Border region in that it forms part of the Objective One region for development purposes and will also benefit from a relatively higher level of permitted State aid under the new EU Regional Aid Guidelines 2000-06. This facilitates the agencies in ensuring that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the regions.</P>
    <P>The last couple of years have resulted in a significant change and focus for IDA Ireland activities in the Border region. This has resulted in the establishment of IDA Ireland's new area office in Cavan to supplement the existing offices in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Sligo; an increase in staff resources by one third in the area; setting the target that 50% of all new jobs from greenfield investment locate in Objective One regions over the coming years; the roll out of a planned property programme for the region, to provide a balanced mix between offices and factory buildings by working closely with the local authorities and private sector investors; the selection of specific sectors targeted for each location, such as international services, electronics, etc.; and an intensive and focused marketing programme, integrating IDA Ireland's regional offices, headquarters and overseas offices, for targeted locations.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also working closely with companies in the Border region, helping them to build up their capability and competitiveness and to increase growth and employment.</P>
    <P>The improvement of business support services, such as the new Derry-Dublin air service to commence immediately between Dublin and City of Derry Airports, to be run by Aer Arann, will be a major boost for the work programme of the industrial development agencies. It is expected that this service will lead to an increase in the flow of business to the region.</P>
    <P>These initiatives, coupled with the implementation of the Government's agenda on infrastructure contained in the national development plan, will act as key building blocks underpinning the future industrial development of the Border region.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the ongoing co-ordinated job creation efforts by the industrial development agencies in the Border region will bring positive results to the region.</P>

      <Quest> if, in view of the changes in financial values which have taken place since it was set, she will increase the maximum weekly wage of £300 set for the purpose of payment of lump sum payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ceiling on pay, which applies to the calculation of benefit under the Redundancy Payments Acts, was first introduced in 1974 by means of the Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments and Lump Sum) Order, 1974 (SI No. 82 of 1974). This set the ceiling at £2,500 per annum. The Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, raised this ceiling to £5,000 per annum and provided for its variation by regulation. When so doing, account had to be taken of average earnings in the transportable goods industries as recorded by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the relationship between the ceiling and the average earnings of this class of worker was established because, historically, this group has been the highest paid on average in industry. However, while the statutes do not impose a legal obligation on me to change the benefit ceiling, there is clearly an expectation that the ceiling would be raised in relation to average earnings. The benefit ceiling was last raised in May 1994 from £13,000 per annum, that is, £250 per week, to its current level of £15,600 per annum, that is, £300 per week.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the level of the ceiling is kept under review.</P>

      <P>The £560 million technology foresight fund was established in response to the increasingly important link between technological development and the future competitiveness of Irish-based industry. The new fund will be used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas within information and communications technologies and biotechnology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A dedicated foundation, operating under the aegis of Forfás, is being established to manage, allocate, disburse and evaluate expenditure from the fund. A high level implementation group has also been established to advise on the arrangements and decisions required to ensure the smooth launch of the foundation. The implementation group is expected to report to the Tánaiste <Col N="321" /> and myself when it has completed its deliberations and work in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware that Forfás, with the assistance of the implementation group to which I have referred, is making appropriate arrangements for a first call for proposals from the fund. These arrangements will be in accordance with accepted best international practice. Researchers will compete for funding on the basis of research excellence which will be assessed by an international peer review involving panels of independent experts. The call will provide details of the scale of funding available and the areas to be funded within biotechnology and information and communication technologies. It is envisaged that the first call for proposals will be announced during the summer. There will then be a period of at least two months for submissions of proposals during which, the call will be promoted both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the fund is to ensure world class research excellence in the selected niche areas and only proposals which meet the criteria set down by the foundation will be funded. The implementation group is also expected to advise on the evaluation process for foundation funded research. I should point out also, that continuation of support for any project funded by the foundation will be dependent on a continuing high quality research output again assessed by international peer review.</P>
    <P>Clearly the way forward for developing Ireland as a knowledge-based society depends on the proactive initiatives by a variety of organisations including the universities. The foundation will add a new dynamism by developing the reputation of Ireland as a location for research and for knowledge-based enterprise.</P>

      <P>Irish and EU regulations relating to technical conservation specify, among other things, the maximum permitted length of net and <Col N="326" /> minimum mesh sizes for fixed and towed gear. The requirements vary depending on the nature of the fishing activity and the species of fish being targeted. For example, drift nets used for tuna fishing cannot exceed 2.5 km. in length, while a minimum mesh size of 120 mm. applies when fishing for hake with gill nets.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined to Commissioner Fischler the need for enhanced EU conservation measures over and above those already in place. Greater protection for undersized and juvenile fish stocks is required. With the support of the Irish fishing industry and backed up by the work of the CFP strategy group on technical conservation, I will continue to press the case in the coming months. In the meantime, ensuring and enforcing compliance with existing conservation measures will continue to be a key priority for the Irish fishery protection service.</P>

      <P>The Irish Coastguard of my Department is responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of all maritime SAR measures and operations within the internationally designated Irish search and rescue region. I have no plans at the moment to introduce penalties on boat owners and or users who are responsible for having the emergency services called out without good reason. Each request for assistance is treated seriously. I know that boats and ships can be dangerous workplaces and all boat and ship owners and users should realise that they are responsible for their own safety. I have, however, asked the Department to look into practice in other countries and to advice on the scope for introducing charges in the circumstances mentioned. We must bear in mind that air and sea rescue services in this country are provided through a mix of State and voluntary organisations and that our structures may not be comparable to those in other countries.</P>
      <P>Regarding hoax calls, it is a matter for the director of telecommunications regulation to determine the nature of any investigation into hoax calls. Hoax calls are referred to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and/or the Garda.</P>
      <P>Regarding hoax calls, I am satisfied with the level of penalties under the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1988, for abusing the marine-band radio which is £1,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. On conviction on indictment in a higher court, this fine can be as high as £20,000 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment. The penalty under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Acts, 1951 and 1983, for abusing the telephone 999 or 112 emergency system is £800 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment. On conviction on indictment in a higher court this figure can be as high as £50,000 and/or up to five years imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, the Taoiseach's representative at the convention, the body charged with formulating a draft charter of fundamental rights, submitted a number of proposed amendments to a list of draft civil and political rights produced by the praesidium of the convention. One of the proposed amendments related to the draft article on children's rights, Article 23 of the draft.</P>
      <P>The article as originally drafted appeared to be based on Article 12.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and reflected just one of several provisions setting out detailed rights in the convention. In this case, the right of the child to express views and have those views taken into account in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. It made no reference to the best interests of the child. Deputy O'Kennedy who is advised by a support group comprising representatives of a number of Government Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Health and Children, submitted a proposed amendment. The proposed amendment suggested that Article 23 as drafted should be deleted and replaced with language from Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The amendment proposed reflects more appropriately the general principle of the predominance of the best interests of the child, a principle which is at the core of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <P>A number of other proposed amendments were made which were similar to that proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> A revised list of articles, based on the amendments received, will be debated at a meeting of the convention this week. At the meeting, the Taoiseach's representative will seek to ensure that the concept of the best interests of the child is inserted in the revised Article 23 in accordance with, and quoting from, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a related question on 15 June, I fully favour a voluntary approach to returns. Kosovars wishing to return home now will be assisted financially by the Government to do so. The intention is to help them start the process of rebuilding their homes and their lives. I recognise that some of the Kosovars who were evacuated here last year may not feel able to return to Kosovo at the present time and I believe that it would be appropriate to allow them remain in Ireland for a further period. When the refugees came here last year, it was indicated to them that, if they wished, they could apply to extend their permission to remain beyond the initial period of one year granted to them. The particular circumstances of individual refugees or families will be given careful consideration in this regard. Proposals regarding the Kosovar programme are currently being elaborated and will be circulated to refugees when they become available.</P>

      <Quest>if Ireland has been asked to provide security here, under the witness protection pro gramme, for people who give evidence to the international war crimes tribunal regarding atrocities committed during the war in Bosnia; if the Government has responded to any such request; if not, when a decision will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I informed the Dáil in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on this subject on 10 May last, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, has been in touch with a number of Governments, including Ireland, concerning participation in a witness relocation programme. The purpose of this programme is to relocate temporarily the small number of witnesses in cases before the ICTY for whom the risk of returning to their former home is very great, to a country outside the former Yugoslavia, as a means of protection.</P>
      <P>I am looking at the possibility of Ireland responding positively to the request of ICTY. Participation in the programme raises a number of issues which involve other Departments. Consultations with them are currently in progress and it is hoped to make a positive decision in the near future. The ICTY has been kept informed of our intentions in relation to the programme via our Embassy in The Hague. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to the safety of the witnesses involved, I would not wish to reveal publicly the details of our participation in the programme beyond to confirm the fact of our participation.</P>

      <P>Officials from the Department met with Ms Nusretta Sivac, a Bosnian human rights campaigner, during her visit to Ireland earlier this year. At this meeting Ms Sivac was assured that the Irish Government, in common with its EU partners and the broader donor community, appreciates the importance of encouraging the return of all refugees and internally displaced people to whatever part of Bosnia they regard as home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Dayton Agreement in 1995, Ireland Aid has supported rehabilitation programmes in Bosnia that see minority return as a key objective. Programmes to rehabilitate houses and factories have been funded, creating the social and economic environment in which people can return to their place of origin knowing that they can have somewhere to live and that there exists <Col N="333" /> a possibility of employment. Mine action programmes have also been supported by Ireland Aid, enabling people to return to areas that had previously been considered unsafe. In addition, in the last three years, a total of IR £550,000 has been disbursed to the Commission for Real Property Claims in Bosnia. This organisation was established by the Dayton Agreement and continues to enjoy substantial success in processing property claims that allow displaced people to return to their rightful homes.</P>
    <P>As such, Ireland Aid has been, and will continue to be, consistently supportive of agencies carrying out rehabilitation work in Bosnia that encourages the return of refugees and other displaced people.</P>

      <P>Galway Airport is a privately owned facility and any proposal to relocate that airport is entirely a matter for the airport authority and its shareholders.</P>
      <P>I am of course aware of recent public comment regarding a proposal to relocate the airport to a site at Oranmore. The chairman and general manager of Galway Airport met with me last November to brief me on the matter. I have not, however, received any formal proposal regarding a new airport for Galway at Oranmore.</P>
      <P>The long-standing policy of my Department as regards the development of aviation facilities is that private interests may provide and develop airports in whatever location they wish, provided the requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority are met and planning permission is secured. It is, of course, for the promoters to satisfy themselves that an airport can function as a viable commercial entity.</P>

      <P>The supply of electricity and the adequacy of such supply to any particular county including the west Waterford area is currently a day-to-day operational matter for ESB and one in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>The existence and quality of the transmission and distribution network is what determines the quality of the supply of electricity.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by ESB that since 1997 they have invested £4 million in upgrading the medium and low voltage networks in the greater Waterford area.</P>
      <P>ESB have plans under way to put in place a 220kV development in west Waterford to reinforce the high voltage networks in the area. This investment is necessary to maintain adequate supplies to farming, commercial and industrial customers and to permit continued growth in the area. The budget is currently being finalised and it is expected that it will be a multi-million pound investment in west Waterford.</P>
      <P>The proposed investment is part of the ESB capital programme for the next five years involving an overall investment in the region of £2 billion, the bulk of which will be dedicated to the enhancement of the electricity network generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This investment will ensure the ongoing provision of a high quality electricity infrastructure <Col N="339" /> in the State to underpin continuing economic development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 to 128, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I received an advance copy of the press statement and a letter from the chairman of Fortum about their intention to divest of their power generation assets in Ireland and the UK. I am informed that following an indepth review of their corporate strategy Fortum are now refocusing their activities in the Nordic and Baltic Rim countries.</P>
      <P>Clearly the divestment as announced will take some time to arrange. In the meantime, Fortum intend to complete construction and commence commercial operation; it is currently five months ahead of schedule. The project is being carried out by Edenderry Power Limited, a subsidiary of Fortum, and the 15 year peat supply contract is with that company and is thus directly linked to the power station. Fortum intend to continue to operate and maintain the plant after divestment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, 1994-1999, EIOP, grant aid up to a maximum level of 26 million ECU has been made available towards the cost of the construction of the new peat station. The grant will pay for up to 23% of the capital expenditure on the plant and is payable on achievement of construction milestones. To date, the company has drawn down £8.8 million of the grant. The company confirmed that they are not in receipt of any other grant assistance for the construction of the station.</P>
    <P>I have read the recent press reports quoting a valuation for the Edenderry plant. Fortum have not released any information relating to the value of the Edenderry plant. Consequently, the figure published in the press must be viewed as speculative.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the Government entering into a joint venture to purchase the Edenderry plant, this is not under consideration. The indications are that Fortum intend to find a single buyer of its UK and Irish assets. My current approach is to continue to stay in touch with developments.</P>
    <P>Based on the assurances of Fortum, I am confident that the station will come on stream ahead of schedule and that the peat purchasing contract will be honoured. The station is supported by a power purchasing agreement with the ESB. Therefore, this is a state-of-the-art project with the necessary fuel supply, technology and an assured market for its output. It would appear, therefore, to be an attractive investment opportunity for a commercial buyer.</P>

    <P>In the context of the re-organisation of the Defence Forces, I approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall numbers of musicians within the School of Music as already provided for within the Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by the previous Government. Under the previous organisation of the Defence Forces, each Army Command &ndash; of which there were four, namely the Eastern, Curragh, Southern and Western Commands &ndash; had a military band. In the new organisational structure, these four Commands were replaced by three brigades. Each of these three brigades, Eastern, Southern and Western, has a band as part of its organisation, with the band of the former Curragh Command being now amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade.</P>
    <P>The military authorities are of the opinion that this new organisation of the School of Music will allow all of the Army bands to function to their full potential.</P>
    <P>The eventual deployment of personnel of the <Col N="343" /> Army School of Music as envisaged under the revised structure will be as follows: </P>

      <P>Ireland's CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06 was submitted to the European Commission at the end of December last. This plan covers early retirement along with REPS, compensatory allowances and forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations with the Commission are taking place on the plan as a whole, and the entire plan will have to be approved before any of the four individual measures can commence. These negotiations are now in their final stage. However once they are complete, there is a standard formal procedure for approval of all plans that has <Col N="347" /> to take place and by its nature this exercise involves a considerable amount of detail and documentation. It is my objective to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time but it is too early at this stage to give any concrete dates for the likely commencement of the new early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The existing early retirement scheme was closed to new applicants on 31 December last. I am aware that a number of farmers have transferred their holdings since then and have not had an opportunity to apply for the scheme. I have proposed to the Commission that those who retired since 31 December will be eligible to apply for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>While I am hopeful that this and the other proposals in the rural development plan will get the approval of the Commission, until the Commission's final decision is available I cannot say categorically what the terms and conditions will be.</P>

It is my objective to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time but it is too early at this stage to give any concrete dates for the likely commencement of the new REPS and early retirement schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, a provision of £180.9 million has been made for a scheme of farm waste management and £65.6 million has been allocated for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and installation aid schemes. These measures will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. The programmes have been submitted to the European Commission for approval. The negotiation process with the European Commission is expected to take a number of months and consequently the measures are unlikely to come on stream until later in the year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it is intended that the national scheme for the control of farm pollution will remain in operation and open to applicants.</P>

      <P>Under the new rules on the milk quota regime which I introduced on 1 April this year, the main instrument for the transfer of milk quotas will be a milk quota restructuring scheme operated at milk purchaser level. The detailed rules for the milk quota restructuring scheme 2000 were published in notices nos. 94/1 and 94/3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's milk quota restructuring scheme will cater, as a matter of priority, for those producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. Of the total pool available for sale under the restructuring scheme, 85% will be allocated to these categories. It is clear that these producers are the ones who would have been most affected in the current year as a result of the transition from one quota regime to another and it was, therefore, essential that they be given priority status. In arriving at <Col N="356" /> this decision I took full account of the views of the milk quota review group. The rules for this year's restructuring scheme were tailored to deal with the particular situation which obtains in the current year and should not be regarded as a blueprint for future years.</P>
    <P>The remaining 15% of the pool, plus any quota remaining unallocated after the entitlements of the special priority producers have been satisfied, will be allocated to all producers who applied for quota under the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme. These allocations will be weighted in favour of producers in the small and medium size categories.</P>
    <P>A milk quota temporary leasing scheme will also operate and the detailed rules on this will be announced later. The milk quota appeals tribunal will continue to examine applications for quota from the national reserve, including the special reserve of 0.5 million gallons set aside from the 20.5 million gallons allocated under Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the milk quota appeals tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the introduction of the milk quota system. The tribunal has not as yet commenced examining applications for the 2000-01 milk quota year.</P>

      <P>At present, overpayments are being recovered from the early retirement pensions of 26 persons in County Galway. In all of these cases the overpayments arose from the offsetting of the old age pensions that they or their spouses receive from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs against their pensions under the early retirement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of the scheme that participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for either the contributory and non-contributory old-age pension. This condition also applies to participants partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are made aware of this condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners <Col N="358" /> in joint management are awarded an old-age pension.</P>
    <P>However, I should say that every effort is made to minimise any hardship to the participants where an overpayment is being recovered.</P>

      <P>The position is that a new area based compensatory allowance scheme is to be introduced with effect from 2001 as part of the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations and in particular to protect the future of these payments in the context of WTO. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate proposals for a new scheme and to ensure an orderly transition. Having considered a range of options the group recommended a scheme which would involve a payment per hectare linked to the type of livestock on the holding. The proposals envisaged a one hectare payment for each livestock unit. I announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. I also announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments for the period 2001-06. The allocation for sheep headage would almost double to £40 million annually.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with officials of my Department the European Commission were not satisfied with aspects of the scheme being proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The fact that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment was seen as continuing the link to production.</P>
      <P>The task now is to devise a scheme which is best suited to our requirements and which meets with Commission approval. I have personally raised the issue with Commissioner Fischler. My officials are in continuing contact with the Commission with a view to devising an alternative proposal. Further consultation is also taking place with the farming bodies with a view to formulating such a scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development plan 2000-2006, provision is made for a new scheme of installation aid for young farmers and an amount of £29.8 million has been allocated for this programme.</P>
      <P>This on-farm investment measure will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region. The operational programmes have been finalised and submitted to the Commission. The requisite negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow. There is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. By definition, and having regard to the very significant financial proposals for spending of both EU and Exchequer moneys in the period to 2006, the procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail. Having regard to the timeframes associated with clearance of past operational programmes, the process is likely to continue over a number of months. Accordingly, it in not possible to indicate at this stage when the schemes involved will commence. However, I will be doing everything possible to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time. Pending the introduction of the new scheme, the current national scheme of installation aid will remain in place and applications made under this latter scheme will continue to be accepted.</P>
      <P>The new scheme of early retirement from farming and the new rural environment protection scheme are included in Ireland's CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-2006. This plan was submitted to the European Commission at the end of December 1999.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with the European Commission began in March and have reached the concluding stage. Following this, a formal EU Commission approval procedure for all plans has to take place. The objective is to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time but it is too early at this stage to give any concrete dates for the likely commencement of the new early retirement and REP schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, the Government has undertaken to adopt, in consultation with the farming and veterinary organisations, a number of measures with the objective of reducing the current incidence of bovine TB by 50% within the next four years.</P>
      <P>These measures include the introduction of an on-farm market valuation system and the assignment of resources in each District Veterinary Office, DVO, to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdowns by taking a pro-active approach to the removal of all sources of infection in each DVO area. This approach will involve the engagement of 75 dedicated departmental and farm relief service personnel who will concentrate their efforts in the 20% of the country which yields 50% of current reactors.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently involved in negotiations with farming and veterinary bodies, in the animal health forum, on the implementation of the foregoing and on other aspects of the disease eradication programme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance is being consulted with regard to the cost implications of the proposed new arrangements.</P>

      <P>The draft guidelines for the Leader+ programme have been adopted and published by the European Commission. The guidelines set down the template for the drafting by member states of operational programmes to be submitted to the Commission for approval and clearance.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of preparing the operational programmes for the implementation of both the Leader+ and the national Leader programmes for submission to the European Commission. It is intended to place advertisements shortly inviting expressions of interest from local groups on the application and implementation of the programmes in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation with relevant parties is required by the European Commission in the preparation of the draft operational programmes and a significant degree of consultation has already taken place. The consultative process is ongoing and a number of advisory seminars have been arranged <Col N="361" /> for July on a regional basis to provide information to prospective participants in the new Leader arrangements.</P>
    <P>Now that the guidelines for Leader+ are in place, I am ensuring that the draft operational programmes for Leader+, together with the mainstream Leader programme proposed under the national development plan, are completed and forwarded to the Commission with a view to obtaining clearance and the prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006. While the European Commission procedure provides for a period of months for formal negotiation and clearance of programmes, I will be pressing for acceptance of our programmes at the earliest time possible.</P>

      <Quest>the policy position which he adopted at the EU Agriculture Council meeting in December 1998 when the continuance of the social butter scheme was discussed; and if the Government has reviewed the possibility of continuing this scheme from Exchequer funding.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had made a request to the EU Commission in 1998 that the scheme for the sale of butter at reduced prices to persons receiving social assistance which was to end on 31 December 1998 should be continued. I therefore welcomed the Commission's proposal to extend it for a further year, even though the level of aid was being further reduced. It was clear to me, however, that no further extension beyond that would be proposed and a number of delegations were prepared to go along with the one year extension only on the basis that it was the final one.</P>
      <P>The new Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products agreed under Agenda 2000 did not provide for the scheme beyond January 2000. There was, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to fund such a scheme from the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, as part of a steering group which I established to draw up specific works packages for alleviating flooding problems in the south Galway area, is currently working with Dúchas, the local authority and local farming organisations in the south Galway area to investigate the feasibility of developing a flood relief scheme to alleviate the <Col N="364" /> excessive flooding in the Termon area of south Galway, which also adversely affects the home of the individuals concerned in County Clare.</P>
      <P>As the Termon scheme will require the transfer of waters from the south Galway area into the adjacent Fergus river catchment, Clare County Council will also be involved in the decision making process for the scheme. Any scheme being considered which would involve the transfer of water into the Fergus river catchment or would be likely to adversely impact on that area would have an assessment of its implications as a prime requirement.</P>
      <P>The Termon scheme is only at the feasibility stage, so it is not possible at present to indicate precisely what the final extent of the scheme proposals for the area might be, or to say if it is possible to have a scheme at all having regard to all the various factors to be determined, including environmental impacts and mitigation measures, costs, benefits, etc.</P>

      <P>The question of innovative financial reward systems is essentially a matter to be developed at enterprise level through the partnership structures. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in paragraph 16 of section 1.3, &lsquo;Workplace relations and work environment' of framework 1, acknowledges that forms of financial involvement will be one of the topics for discussion and in paragraph 19 it is stated that:</P>
      <P>ICTU and IBEC recognise the part which a link between the financial performance of the company and the individual employee plays in developing and deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness. The schemes in operation include ESOTs, ESOPs, gainsharing, profit sharing and other financial employee incentives. IBEC and ICTU will work together to produce guidelines to support, facilitate and encourage this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 8 of section 1.1, Taxation of framework 1, the Government and the social partners acknowledged the role of the above mentioned <Col N="365" /> financial employee incentives and it was agreed that a consultative committee, involving ICTU, IBEC and appropriate Government Departments and agencies, would be established to prepare proposals for consideration in the context of budget 2001. The committee has had three meetings to date and is due to meet again in July 2000.</P>

      <P>Oil prices have risen from about $16 per barrel in June 1999 to the current level of around $30 per barrel, an increase that was magnified by the intervening decline in the euro/dollar parity. The resulting increase in the price of motor fuel, motor oil and home heating oil contributed 1.1% to the 5.2% increase in headline inflation in the year to May last.</P>
      <P>Regarding the inflation forecast for this year, I revised upwards our average inflation forecast last month. A new set of macro-economic forecasts, including inflation, will be published as usual by my Department in the economic review and outlook in July-August.</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm the VAT to be levied upon a self-employed person (details supplied) in County Dublin earning less than £20,000 per annum.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a self employed person supplying services does not have to register or account for VAT if the turnover from the supply of those services does not exceed, or is not likely to exceed, £20,000 in any continuous period of 12 months. If the threshold is not exceeded the self employed person may, subject to certain conditions, elect to register and account for VAT. A business with a turnover of less than £20,000 does not have to charge VAT to its customers but it cannot reclaim VAT charged to it by its suppliers.</P>
      <P>Further information is available in the Revenue information leaflet &ldquo;VAT for Small Business &ndash; A Revenue Guide&rdquo;, a copy of which has been sent to the Deputy. If the taxpayer has a specific problem, the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes, VAT technical services unit, Setanta Centre, Nassau Street, will be happy to assist further in the matter. The telephone number is: 6716777, ext: 70777.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a large number of service companies in the construction sector have difficulties in their understanding of their obligations in respect of taxation for employees who are hired on a contract basis given that there seems to be a lack of clarity in the application of existing taxation legislation, specifically in relation to the obligation of a European worker, just arrived in Ireland, to pay tax; whether such workers have a tax free holiday; the obligation of the same worker to pay VAT; the steps an employer should take to ensure that he is not held liable for the payment of tax of these persons at a future Revenue audit; if he will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with his Department issue a tax guidance bulletin that would outline the precise position in relation to these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17950/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxation regime for individuals, whether or not they are hired on a contract basis, depends on whether the individuals are employed or self-employed. The terms &ldquo;employed&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-employed&rdquo; are not defined in law. The question of which category a worker is in depends on what the individual does and the terms and conditions, be they written, verbal or implied, under which he or she is engaged. In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. However, it is recognised that in some <Col N="371" /> cases it may be difficult to determine where the dividing line falls. To assist this process Revenue, in conjunction with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, have published guidelines and issued a joint information leaflet on factors to be taken into account in determining whether an individual is to be treated as employed or self-employed for tax and social insurance purposes. Guidelines have also been devised with specific reference to the factors relevant to the construction industry sector. These guidelines are included in Revenue information leaflet IT 25.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's specific example of a European construction worker working in Ireland, the tax legislation covering the residence of individuals and the provisions of double taxation agreements would have a bearing on the taxation position. In general individuals are liable to income tax in Ireland in respect of income from a trade or employment exercised in the State.</P>
      <P>There is no general entitlement to a &ldquo;tax holiday&rdquo; and no such concept exists in Irish tax law. Instead the tax treatment depends on the circumstances of each case as governed by national tax law and international double taxation treaties.</P>
      <P>Where an individual is self employed and is a resident of a country with which Ireland has a double taxation convention (a treaty country), he or she would be liable to income tax only where he or she trades through a permanent establishment situated in the State. A building site would be regarded as a permanent establishment if the individual is present on the site for a period of time, typically six months. Relevant contracts tax (RCT) would apply to any payments made to that person by a builder. Tax should be deducted by the builder at 35% unless the person has a C2 certificate and the builder has been authorised by the inspector of taxes to make payments without deduction of RCT. There are procedures in place for the person to reclaim this RCT if no liability arises. The obligations of principal contractors and sub-contractors are set out in Revenue information leaflets IT63 and IT64.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the individual is an employee then the person who is contractually obliged to make the payment to the worker would in general be the employer for the purposes of collecting income tax and PRSI levies through the PAYE system. In certain circumstances there is provision within the PAYE regulations for a person to have more than one employer &ndash; a paying employer, such as a service company, and an employer under whose control the employee works &ndash; and for interaction between both employers to ensure that PAYE and PRSI is operated by one of them. An employer resident outside the State and not trading in the State through a permanent establishment would not be required to operate PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employee who is a resident of a treaty country is working for an employer who is <Col N="372" /> resident outside the State and the employer is not trading in the State through a permanent establishment, then provided the employee is present in the State for less than 183 days he or she would not be liable to income tax. An employee who is not a resident of a treaty country is liable to income tax in respect of an employment exercised in the State, irrespective of how long the employee is in the State or whether the employer has a permanent establishment in the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on VAT a person established in the State who, otherwise than as an employee of another person, engages in the supply within the State, of taxable goods or services in the course or furtherance of business, is a taxable person for VAT purposes where their turnover from such supply exceeds set thresholds. Currently these thresholds are, in general, £40,000 for persons supplying goods and £20,000 for persons supplying services. An unestablished person supplying goods or services in the State is not entitled to any turnover threshold and is a taxable person in respect of all such supplies. All taxable persons are liable to register and account for VAT on their supplies of goods and/or services.</P>
    <P>Where an invoice charging Irish VAT is received from a supplier the validity of any of the details shown on it may be verified by contacting the tax district dealing with the business. It is recommended that this be done if there is any reason to doubt the authenticity of such invoice details. This is the best way to protect the position of the Irish business in the event of a subsequent tax audit.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they will undertake a review of the information leaflets currently available for the construction industry in light of the Deputy's question and will consider what further material should be made available. In the meantime, companies in doubt as to their obligations are advised to contact their local tax office for advice.</P>

    <P>The provisions mainly relate to prudential regulation of credit institutions, i.e. ensuring that they follow sound business practices, particularly in relation to valuation of mortgages and other balance sheet items, so as to avoid the collapse of credit institutions.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has completed consultations with the financial services industry and will shortly issue the administrative orders to implement the provisions of these directives.</P>

It is expected that the Commissioners of Public Works and the developer, M/s Sisk,will sign a contract in August 2000. Work is programmed to start on site in September 2000. The construction period is approximately 17 months. The building will be occupied early in 2002 mainly by staff from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Dundalk Garda Station project will involve the conversion of the attic of the Garda station to accommodate a radio/CCTV room. This project is currently at sketch scheme stage. The cost estimate is £200,000.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works will carry out the following arterial drainage work in County Louth in the next one to two years:</P>
      <P>Arterial drainage maintenance; Glyde and Dee drainage scheme; maintenance of approximately 50 km of scheme channels per annum; maintenance of a significant number of accommodation bridges and maintenance of coastal embankments in Annagassan.</P>
      <P>On the Asbestos Management programme there are a total of 89 schools in County Louth &ndash; 73 primary and 16 post-primary. To date surveys have been carried out in four, namely, Donacarney NS Drogheda; Bush post-primary, Riverstown; St Laurence's Community College, Drogheda and St. Oliver Plunkett NS Blackrock. All asbestos removal works, which are necessary in three only, are in the course of being commissioned or are in progress. The main County Louth schools survey will be carried out in autumn 2000 with a view to having works carried out in 2001. Surveys of Office of Public Works owned buildings will take place in 2002.</P>
      <P>On the driving test centre/Revenue (Custom Office) the commissioners plan to develop a State owned site at Newry Road, Dundalk, for use by Revenue (customs), who currently occupy a small part of it, and as a new driving test centre. It is hoped to complete the project by early 2002. This will supplement the main development adjacent to the civic offices. The commissioners will then be in a position to dispose of a number of leased premised in Dundalk.</P>

      <P>Given that I am still engaged in a process of consultation with my Government colleagues before presenting proposals to Government with a view to decisions being taken on the new programme of decentralisation by the end of next month, I am not in a position to comment on the likelihood of any centre or region featuring in the forthcoming programme, other than to say that I am aware of the very many cases for inclusion in the programme, all of which will be fully considered before decisions are taken.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the review group is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I did not issue instructions to the group as to how it should proceed with its work. Prior to the setting up of the group, I, along with my colleague, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, together with officials from both our Departments met with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace and her officials to discuss the scheme. We agreed that a review of the scheme should be conducted by officials of the three Departments and of the <Col N="378" /> Revenue Commissioners, who operate the scheme on a day to day basis. No submissions have been made to the group by my Department but officials in the Department are members of the group.</P>

      <P>However, a formal Government decision has not been taken to introduce any form of landfill tax or levy at present. This issue is likely to be considered as part of the group's deliberations for the 2001 budget preparations.</P>

      <P>On 2 December 1999 the European Commission formally confirmed the national development plan complied with all the relevant provisions of the Structural Funds regulations. They indicated that they would proceed to appraise the plan with the aim of approving a community support framework for Ireland on the EU cofinanced elements of the plan.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31 January 2000 the Commission forwarded a negotiating mandate which formed the basis of the negotiations on the CSF. The negotiating mandate sought clarification of environmental issues in relation to the <i>ex ante </i>assessment of the plan's impact, indicators and project selection. It also sought a firm commitment that Ireland would comply with the requirements of Natura 2000. In the negotiations which followed in February and March there were exchanges of papers and of an oral nature in relation to this and the other non-environmental issues. Negotiations on the issue of environmental sustainability culminated in the Commission proposing a standard text on compliance with Natura 2000 for all member states' CSFs. The standard text was to include a deadline for compliance which would be specific to each member state. This standard text was <Col N="379" /> accepted by Ireland with a compliance deadline of six months from the date of the Commission's decision on Ireland's CSF.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the CSF have been concluded. We understand from the Commission that the agreement in principle of the Commission to the CSF will be forthcoming on 26 June and that they will formally approve the CSF in early July upon conclusion of the consultation process with the various standing committees provided for under the Structural Funds regulations.</P>

Accordingly, for a given interest rate, higher house prices &ndash; if based on higher borrowings &ndash; will add to inflation as measured by the CPI. My Department accepts that higher house prices will also have an indirect effect through the extent to which they may prompt demands for higher pay increases. However my Department has not sought to establish the extent of this relationship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1999 budget the Minister for Finance announced that a respite care grant of £200 was being introduced for recipients of carer's allow<Col N="383" /> ance as a contribution towards respite care. Payment of the grant issued in June 1999. In August 1999 carer's allowance was extended to recipients of domiciliary care allowance who met the necessary criteria. The decision to increase the respite care grant to £300 and extend it to certain beneficiaries of domiciliary care allowance was announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2000 on 1 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for paying the respite care grant to recipients of domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance or recipients of carer's allowance only. The health boards are responsible for paying the respite care grant to those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance only. The health board respite care grant is aligned with the criteria used by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which allow for one respite care grant per carer.</P>
      <P>My officials wrote to health boards on 16 March 2000 explaining the nature of the payment. In this correspondence health boards were asked to include an explanatory note with the respite care grant payment in June 2000, so that recipients did not confuse the respite care grant payment with any other health board payment. I hope this information clarifies the position.</P>

      <P>I understand the problems raised by the Deputies are confined to the personal assistance service in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. I am aware that problems in recruiting and retaining personal assistants to maintain the current level of service provision have recently arisen in the personal assistance service provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, on behalf of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am pleased to advise the Deputies that, given the exceptional circumstances involved, I have approved the provision of additional funding to the authority this year to resolve the matter.</P>

      <P>There is only one level of general nurse in Ireland, that of registered general nurse, RGN. This is equivalent to the United Kingdom qualification of registered general nurse. The minimum <Col N="393" /> training required to achieve this qualification or its equivalent throughout the European Union is laid down in EU directives. The state enrolled nurse, SEN, qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised in Ireland. However, a number of holders of that qualification are employed in the health services in other capacities, such as ward attendants and care assistants.</P>
      <P>The issue of the provision of conversion courses in this country for SENs was considered by the Commission on Nursing. The commission noted that there is no tradition in Ireland of a registerable nursing qualification other than registered nurse. It also found that there is no precedent in Ireland for the provision of courses of the type provided for SENs in the United Kingdom. The commission did not recommend any change in the rules of An Bord Altranais in relation to the recognition of the SEN qualification or the provision of conversion courses in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to provide financial assistance for holders of the SEN qualification wishing to undertake conversion courses in the United Kingdom. My priority is the continued implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing, and all available funding is being directed towards achieving the objectives set out in the priority action plan agreed between my Department and the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike last October.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, dealt almost entirely with the recognition of foreign adoption orders and procedures to be followed by Irish adopters. It provided that the Adoption Board would approve prospective adopters of foreign children and issue declarations of eligibility and suitability in advance of their adopting overseas. Assessments may only be carried out by a health board or registered adoption society. When an eligibility-suitability assessment report has been prepared by a health board or registered adoption society, the proposed adopters may request the agency to forward their application to the Adoption Board for a declaration of their eligibility and suitability. Where the Adoption Board makes a declaration in favour of the proposed adopters, it will forward a copy of the declaration of eligibility and suitability and the assessment report to the applicants through the assessing agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment is based on a national standardised framework which has been developed for inter-country adoption assessment procedures. The standardised framework was developed in 1999 following a detailed study of inter-country adoption assessment procedures countrywide. While all elements are not yet fully <Col N="396" /> implemented in all health boards, the key principles which guide a good assessment should be firmly established at this stage.</P>
    <P>All social workers will shortly be working from a standard set of resource materials and all prospective adoptive couples will receive a standard workbook to help them reflect on the issues which arise in the inter-country adoption process outside of formal sessions or interviews. The process pre-adoption is divided into five stages as follows:</P>

This can be done via the Adoption Board for certain countries, through native foundations-agencies of the foreign countries or other intermediary agencies.</P>
    <P>The current procedures for the advance assessment of couples are in line with those set out in the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. Adoption is a service for children. When health boards carry out an assessment of eligibility-suitability of a couple they do it on behalf of the adoptive child. It is internationally accepted best practice that the adoptive family should be recognised as being suitable, in <Col N="397" /> advance of the placement of the child; and the adoptive family should have access to systematic and thorough preparation for adoption.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new framework has established an appropriate set of standards for inter-country adoption procedures in line with best international practice. As a result of the increased interest in inter-country adoption among couples, waiting times are long in many boards. Every effort is being made to reduce these waiting times as well as the time taken to complete an assessment. Additional funding in 1999 and 2000 has effectively doubled the budget for this service area. All boards are moving towards implementation of the framework model and the other recommendations contained in the report on the standardised framework. Initiatives include recruitment of additional social work and clerical-administrative staff; training for social work staff to assist in the implementation of the new framework; the improvement of IT resources and the provision of additional office space. These initiatives are aimed at building up social work staffing and maximising social work time spent on the actual assessment of applicants. While progress varies between boards, I am satisfied that efficiencies are being achieved in all boards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that the continuing rapid increase in demand is affecting the ability of boards to reduce waiting times dramatically. In addition, as I have already noted in the House, the recruitment and retention of social work staff is an ongoing difficulty in a number of board areas.</P>
    <P>An implementation group was established to plan, prioritise and cost the implementation of the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures. This group has nearly finished its work and advised that a report on progress will be made available to me this week. I understand this report will contain, <i>inter alia</i>, a comprehensive outline of developments arising from the implementation of the standardised framework as well as findings and recommendations on the future of the inter-country adoption service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years my Department has allocated significant additional funding to hospitals providing accident and emergency services, particularly in the eastern region. I have provided additional funding of £2 million in the current year to enable hospitals to continue to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing difficulties experienced in their accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware responsibility for the provision of health and social services, which includes accident and emergency services, in the eastern region now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I understand that the authority has established a dedicated team to examine in detail the existing accident and emergency services in the eastern region as a whole, including paediatric accident and emergency services, and to bring forward a comprehensive policy on the development of accident and emergency services in the region generally.</P>
      <P>The team will review issues affecting accident and emergency services in terms of the principles of access, timeliness, appropriateness and quality. It will seek to ensure patients presenting at accident and emergency departments within the eastern region have access to an appropriate service that deals with their needs in a timely and comprehensive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review will address a variety of issues to include the examination of services within accident and emergency departments, and the examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It is expected that examination of these areas will generate solutions for current problems occurring in some hospital acci<Col N="400" /> dent and emergency departments such as long waiting times for diagnosis and treatment; long waiting times on trolleys for patients awaiting admission; and overcrowding in accident and emergency departments arising in part from delays in admission of patients.</P>
    <P>A review of alternative options for care will also be conducted. These options will include development of out of hours GP services at community centres or in a hospital setting; and development of satellite and community based units for minor injury and illnesses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's specific question in relation to the accident and emergency services at Beaumont and the Mater, I understand from the authority that the position is as follows. A new accident and emergency consultant has been appointed at Beaumont Hospital which will ease the pressures in the accident and emergency department. The hospital has also identified a number of key initiatives for implementation over the next three years. These include reorganisation within the accident and emergency department; the introduction of emergency nurse practitioners who can deal with patients with minor injuries; consideration of a primary care centre on the Beaumont Hospital site; the upgrading of links between Beaumont Hospital and local GPs; the establishment of a chest pain and respiratory clinic; improved links between the accident and emergency department and other specialities; and the opening of a new unit for stroke sufferers.</P>
    <P>During the past three years Beaumont Hospital has spent £640,000 upgrading the accident and emergency department and in replacing obsolete equipment. Further refurbishment of the department and the purchase of more new equipment is planned.</P>
    <P>This year also saw the provision of a new computerised system to more accurately track and prioritise patients attending the accident and emergency department at the hospital.</P>
    <P>Efforts to improve services in the accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital are ongoing. These include the introduction of a nurse practitioner in September; the creation of a GP liaison nurse post; the recent refurbishment of the accident and emergency treatment area; refurbishment of the accident and emergency waiting area; and the introduction of an accident and emergency observation ward consisting of six beds.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the initiative of the authority in this vital area of health services provision will result in a much improved service for patients presenting at accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>Significant revenue funding has been allocated this year to support the development of additional services to persons with an intellectual disability and autism with an annual cost of £35 million. Because of the timeframe involved in bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001. It is anticipated that this additional revenue funding will provide 555 new residential places, 185 new respite places, 700 new day places, health related support services for persons with autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements, and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides a new framework within which unprecedented capital investment will be made in the health services in the period from 2000-06. In the area of intellectual disability services, this investment focuses on three main areas, the provision of new facilities from which a broad range of support services, including residential, respite and day services, can be delivered, the renovation of existing facilities, and the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements.</P>
      <P>Additional capital funding of £30 million is being made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and £10 million in 2002. This is a total of £80 million over the next three years, to support these developments.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided in 2000 brings the total revenue and capital funding provided by this Government to date for these services to £121.7 million, with a full year cost of £128.7 million in 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to be definitive as to the total <Col N="402" /> nursing complement required to provide adequate staffing for hospitals. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a working group representative of nursing unions and health service employers. This working group held its first meeting on 15 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The results of the most recent survey of nursing vacancies carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, confirmed again that there is not a nation-wide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
      <P>There were 3,236 temporary whole time equivalent nursing posts at 31 December 1998 according to the Department's health service personnel census. This figure represented 12.1% of the total number. While the 1999 census is not yet to hand, I can inform the Deputy that a significant number of temporary posts were converted to permanent positions during 1999 under phase two of the conversion process outlined in the 1997 nurses' pay agreement. Under this process temporary nurses who had one year's continuous wholetime service with their employer at 1 June 1998 or who had worked a minimum of 4,000 hours in the six years prior to 1 June 1998 and were available for work on a full-time or part-time basis were eligible to compete.</P>
      <P>Where the number of eligible applicants exceeded the number of vacancies-posts which could be filled-converted, applicants were issued with letters of comfort and offered permanent appointments as vacancies-opportunities arise. Health services management and unions are in agreement that the volume of temporary employment should be reduced to a minimum consistent with operational requirements.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These initiatives include the following. New arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad. A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working <Col N="403" /> in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Some 11 hospitals around the country provided back to nursing courses in 1999 for nurses wishing to return to the workforce. A total of 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is aimed at maximising the available nursing workforce. During 1999-00, 16 new post-registration programmes have been developed. This year there will be 660 places on post-registration courses in specialised areas of clinical practice. In response to an identified need, 11 of the 16 new programmes will be located outside the Dublin area. An anti-bullying policy document, prepared by the HSEA and agreed with the nursing unions, was published in December 1999 and has been widely promoted within the service.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. Up to 1,250 clinical nurse-midwife specialist positions are being introduced for nurses who have recognised expertise in particular areas. These posts attract clinical nurse manager two salary. Nurses are also benefiting from an agreement to upgrade 1,100 staff nurse posts to clinical nurse manager one grade which is being implemented. A study of the nursing and midwifery resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. As part of this project, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health Research Board and awarded to the Department of Nursing Studies, University College Cork. Agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicate that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here.</P>
    <P>Employers have stepped up their recruitment from abroad with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, for example, in addition to ongoing recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <P>Swift progress is being made on the implementation of the agenda for change mapped out by the Commission on Nursing. A priority action plan was agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. Additional funding of £10 million has been provided this year for initiatives in the action plan.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees <Col N="404" /> paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in the public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005 and will act as an incentive to newly-qualified nurses to enter the workforce immediately following registration and to remain in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The number of nursing training places is being increased to 300 over last year. This year there are a total of 1,500 training places available &ndash; 1,000 general nursing, 300 psychiatric nursing and 200 mental handicap nursing. Further funding totalling £400,000 was made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country late last year to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns aimed at promoting nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>This year there were more than three applicants for every available training place. This is most encouraging bearing in mind that the total number of training places is being increased by 25% over last year and the reduction in the volume of applicants for public service positions generally. The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify. In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms have also been increased.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

The question of health and safety provisions is essentially one for the individual agencies to deal with on a day to day basis within their annual determination, service planning process and legal requirements under the health and safety Acts.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has constantly highlighted &ndash; for example, annual reports, advisory committee on the health services sector &ndash; the risks involved in heavy lifting. They have been working with the health services employers to identify the hazards, and minimise the risks involved in patient handling. For example, they have produced a guide intended to assist those involved with, and responsible for, patient handling in the health care sector, Caring with Minimal Lifting. In addition, employers carry out a programme of training in this area.</P>
      <P>As part of the annual allocation of funding to health agencies I have made resources available to supplement health and safety initiatives which are being undertaken at local level by health boards, hospitals and mental handicap homes. A proportion of this health and safety funding is used to provide training and equipment in the area of safe manual handling. While there is no specific compensation scheme for health care workers in the case outlined by the Deputy, as you can see from the above every effort is made by health service employers to minimise the development of injuries through training, the provision of appropriate equipment and the availability of an occupational health service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the development of health services for older people in County Mayo is a matter for the Western Health Board. The question of proceeding with development of a community nursing unit in Ballinrobe will depend on the priority attached to the scheme by the board <i>vis-à-vis</i> its other capital proposals in the <Col N="406" /> context of funding available under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that, according to the 1996 census of population, there were 1,805 people over 65 years residing in the Ballinrobe area and that there are six older people from the area on the waiting list for admission to residential care. The board further reports that it does not have information on the number of older people who would avail of a day care service if it was available in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.</P>
      <P>A framework already exists for the regulation of many products which are derived from human tissue which originates in Ireland or elsewhere. For example, the most widely transfused human tissue in use here is human blood or its components such as plasma, red cells or platelets and these must comply with the following before they are used in the Irish health sector: council recommendation on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood in the European Community, 29 June 1998; European Community Guide to good manufacturing practice for medicinal products (vol. IV of the rules governing medicinal products in the European Community); and guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components (fifth edition, 1999) &ndash; Council of Europe. There is also a substantial regulatory framework for the use of medicines and medical devices in Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) was established under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, to licence the manufacture, preparation, importation, distribution and sale of medicinal products in Ireland. This volume of work provides for the regulation of human and veterinary medicinal products used in Ireland, whether they are manufactured in Ireland or abroad.</P>
      <P>The use of medical devices in Ireland is governed by the European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, S.I. 252 of 1994, and the European Communities (Active Implantable Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, S.I. 253 of 1994. These regulations transposed the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive 90/385/EEC into Irish law respectively. Directive 98/79/EC on <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices is due to be transposed shortly and it is hoped that a further directive on medical devices incorporating derivatives of human blood or plasma will be adopted in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In addition to the statutory framework in place, individual hospitals have their own protocols and auditing systems in place whereby human tissues and products which incorporate them are subject to inspection procedures before they are used. I recognise that despite the regulatory framework in place that there are wider issues which need attention concerning the harvesting and use of human tissues which originate in Ireland or elsewhere. I am currently planning the establishment of a specialist group to consider these issues and to advise me as to the updating of legislation and legalities in this area.</P>

      <P>The Irish health care system is structured to <Col N="410" /> ensure that a high quality health care system is available to people based on need rather than ability to pay. This commitment to the principle of equity was reinforced in the national health strategy &ndash; shaping a healthier future. In the context of this underlying principle of equity, it is considered that public funds can be utilised to best effect when those who have the means to do so fund their own care or contribute to the cost of that care. The OECD publication Economic Survey of Ireland (1997) concluded that the system based on a mixture of public and private care had &ldquo;resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the tax payer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still <Col N="411" /> be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.

In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, with the establishment of additional clinics in the near future I understand that the authority expect that the current waiting list will be eliminated.</P>

      <P>The numbers of deaths registered by the national sudden infant death register for the years referred to by the Deputy are: 1996 &ndash; 38; 1997 &ndash; 54; 1998 &ndash; 40; 1999 &ndash; 46 (provisional); 2000 &ndash; (not yet available).</P>
      <P>My Department has provided funding to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association &ndash; ISIDA &ndash; for the operation of the national sudden infant death register, which has been in existence since 1991, and has provided much valuable information in relation to the incidence of sudden infant death in Ireland. The amounts provided towards research into this area are as follows: 1996 &ndash; £40,000 towards the cost of the national sudden infant death register; 1997 &ndash; £103,231 towards the cost of the national sudden infant death register; £15,000 was also provided to the ISIDA towards the cost of an international conference on sudden infant death syndrome involving eminent researchers, professionals and bereaved families; £5,000 was also provided by the health promotion unit of my Department to the ISIDA to facilitate the printing of information booklets and posters alerting parents to the factors which may contribute to sudden infant deaths; 1998 &ndash; £80,287 was provided to the ISIDA towards the cost of the sudden infant death register and in order to initiate a bereavement counselling service; a sum of £3,600 was also provided to the ISIDA in respect of the finalisation of their study into the role of toxic chemicals in sudden infant death syndrome; 1999 &ndash; from 1999 a sum of £160,000 was allocated on an ongoing basis to the ISIDA towards the cost of the national sudden infant death register and its related research and service budgets. My Department will continue to support the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association, both in its efforts to identify the causes of sudden infant death and in its work in supporting affected families.</P>

      <P>The medical staffing of public hospitals is being considered by the Medical Manpower Forum at present. The forum is due to finalise its first report shortly. One of the key principles of the forum is to ensure that the highest quality of medical care is provided for those who require the services of hospitals. This will require an increase in the present number of hospital con<Col N="413" /> sultant posts and a number of other linked changes.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the forum's first report, it is proposed that the next steps should be an assessment of the effect of the changes recommended in a representative number of hospitals. This assessment will take into account the changes in medical staffing required to give effect to the recommendations of the forum. It is envisaged that the assessment should be completed in six months.</P>

      <P>No formal request for funding for staffing and training to operate an MRI scanner has been received in my Department, although my officials have been aware that The Children's Hospital, Temple Street has fundraised for the capital costs involved in purchasing an MRI scanner. However, any decision in relation to the funding of new services within the Eastern Regional Health Authority region will have to take account of objective assessment of need and competing priorities for capital and revenue funding.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority task force, at the request of my Department, commissioned an external review of the need for dedicated paediatric MRI services in the eastern region. I have been informed that a final draft report has now been received by the ERHA and the authority has recently sought a meeting with my Department to discuss the findings of this report.</P>

      <P>Health boards are responsible for the provision of health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities within their functional area. The health boards decide, in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services on priorities for allocation of the additional funding available for development of services, including hearing impairment services, for the sector. The co-ordinating committees are representative of the health boards, the voluntary sector service providers and the service users. I understand the Irish Deaf Society's main area of concern is the promotion, support and development of Irish sign language, rather than actual service provision. However, I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of officials in my Department and the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to put in place a compensation scheme such as the Deputy suggests.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that, in common with other vaccines and therapeutic substances, adverse reactions to three-in-one vaccine can occur. It has been considered in this country, as in all other countries using this vaccine, that the benefits to children far outweigh the potential risks and help to protect them from the serious consequences of a previously prevalent disease. The great majority of adverse reactions to vaccination are non-serious and temporary in nature. The identification and use of contraindications to particular vaccines helps further to reduce any potential risk.</P>
      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in my reply to question number 290 on 11 April 2000, an adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system is operated by the Irish Medicines Board and information collected through this system is an important method of monitoring drug safety in normal clinical practice, by increasing knowledge about known adverse drug reactions and also by acting as an early warning system for the identification of previously unrecognised adverse reactions.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about a third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played and, I am sure, will continue to play a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure that all medical trainees, both EU and non-EU nationals, are of the highest standard. The matter of revising the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is under active consideration. I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals this year. In addition, I intend to bring forward legislation this week which will enable me to extend the period of temporary registration from the present five years to seven years in an effort to alleviate recruitment difficulties which hospitals are encountering from 1 July 2000. I will be looking for the co-operation of the House in this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority of my Department in recent years. A draft policy document for the further development of mental health services for children and adolescents, including the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was prepared some time ago and circulated to all health boards and the Royal College of Psychiatrists for their views. The observations of the health boards and the college raised a number of matters which require some further analysis and review before a policy document can be finalised. In order to prepare this document a working group has been established to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The terms of reference of this group are: to examine the current state of child and adolescent services in the country; to carry out a needs analysis of the population under 18 years for such services and to identify shortcomings in meeting these needs; and to make recommendations on how child and adolescent services might be developed both in terms of facilities and manpower in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs.</P>
      <P>The working group held its first meeting on 15 June 2000. It was agreed at that meeting that one of its priorities would be to consider the organisation of services for the treatment of ADD-ADHD. The working group hopes to produce an interim report later this year.</P>

    <P>In view of the current primary immunisation uptake levels generally, my Department wrote earlier this year to all of the health boards, requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year, and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. Among the issues which boards were asked to address were the need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches, if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>
    <P>On 31 May, at a meeting between officials of my Department and senior health board management, the importance of addressing the unsatisfactory uptake of MMR and other primary immunisations was again emphasised and all boards were asked to take the necessary measures to maximise uptake levels.</P>
    <P>The Office for Health Gain has developed a new campaign to heighten public awareness about the importance of MMR immunisation and this was launched on 20 June.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to strongly urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella for individual children and the population generally.</P>

      <P>I received a copy of Cáirde's report &ldquo;HIV/AIDS &ndash; A Fresh Approach&rdquo; which was launched earlier this month and I am aware of the comments made by Cáirde regarding the national AIDS strategy. Cáirde is represented on the national AIDS strategy committee and its care and management sub-committee. Membership of NASC also includes representatives from the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, health boards and voluntary organisations. Cáirde has requested that the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism, Sport and Recreation should also be involved in formulating strategy.</P>
      <P>The committee comprises 28 members at present and efforts are being made to streamline the work of the committee and its sub-committees to ensure that members' valuable time is not spent dealing with issues which do not relate to their area of expertise. I understand that the issue of membership of the committee is being discussed at present and the proposal to broaden it to include the Departments suggested by Cáirde will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that my Department's representative on NASC, who is chairman of the national drugs strategy team, has close links with the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A number of common issues emerge in that forum in the context of social exclusion, poverty and family supports. In addition, my Department is represented on the interdepartmental group <Col N="422" /> which reports to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and through this group there are ongoing links with all other relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>The main substances used for the induction of labour in maternity hospitals in Ireland are oxytocin and prostaglandins. Dinoprostone is also used. Ergometrine is used during labour, primarily to stimulate uterine contraction, after delivery and to prevent post-partum bleeding. Misoprostol may also be used to induce labour and to prevent post-partum bleeding but is not used routinely.</P>
      <P>Infant jaundice, as a result of oxytocin administration, although uncommon, has been documented in the medical literature. Cases of neonatal liver damage have been reported to result from rapid, high doses of oxytocin, administered during labour. Careful monitoring of the mother and the foetus is routinely carried out when these medications are being administered during labour.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has received no reports of suspected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of these substances.</P>

      <P>Some concerns have been expressed regarding a possible link between cancer and exposure to non-ionising radiation emissions from mobile phone masts. A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally on this matter. It has not been proven that such exposure might cause the development of cancer.</P>
      <P>Approval for the erection of mobile phone masts in a particular area is a function of the local planning authority. The monitoring of the levels of emissions from mobile phone masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. That office publishes an audit report of licensed operators each year. The audit is carried out by Enterprise Ireland for the office. The most recent report published in February 2000 focuses on compliance with the general public exposure limits specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection in 1998. The report shows that all the companies audited have procedures and arrangements in place to ensure compliance with the general public exposure limits.</P>

      <P>The community warden service is to be piloted in five local authorities &ndash; Galway city, Galway, Leitrim and Wexford county councils and Naas UDC. Local task forces are being established in each of the pilot authorities to develop detailed, appropriate implementation proposals with a view to the pilots starting in early 2001. The pilots will run for three years whereupon there will be a full evaluation before deciding on wider implementation of the new service. I am satisfied with the progress to date and I am confident the pilots will deliver hard facts upon which to base future decisions regarding the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288, 294 and 314 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; S.I. No. 181 of 2000 &ndash; on 22 July 2000. The new regulations increase, subject to certain conditions, the size of extensions to the rear of houses which are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, from 23 square metres to 40 square metres, where the house has not been extended previously. The regulations set out a number of conditions designed to ensure that the changes in relation to exempted development extensions do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties. Where the house is either terraced or semi-detached, the floor area of the first floor extension, if any, shall not exceed 12 square metres. Therefore, any extension to a terraced or semi-detached house, which would result in a floor area at first floor level of greater than 12 square metres will require planning permission; where the house is detached, the floor area of the first floor extension, if any, shall not exceed 20 square metres. Therefore, any extension to a detached house which would involve a first floor area of more than 20 square metres, will require planning permission. Where the house has been previously extended, the floor area of any such extension, taken together with the floor area of any previous extension or extensions, including those for which planning permission has been obtained, shall not exceed 40 square metres. In other words, any extension which would increase the extended area of the house in excess of 40 <Col N="428" /> square metres, will require planning permission. In the case of a semi-detached or terraced house which has been extended previously, the floor area of any first floor extension should not exceed either the floor area of the first floor of the existing extension or 12 square metres, whichever is the greater. In the case of a detached house which has been previously extended, the floor area of the first floor extension should not exceed the floor area of the first floor of the existing extension or 20 square metres, whichever is the greater. The regulation also sets out the required distances between windows in domestic extensions and the facing boundary of an adjoining property. The regulation also specifies that the roof of any such extension should not be used as a balcony or roof garden.</P>
    <P>The new regulations have immediate effect. Copies of the regulations have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 &ndash; Second Schedule, Part 1, Class 6 &ndash; already provide that the development to the front or side of a dwelling house of a hard surface for the parking of not more than two motor vehicles used for a purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house is exempted development.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a local authority will not refund motor tax unless there is a minimum of three months unexpired tax, in view of the fact there is responsibility on car owners to back tax vehicles to the beginning of the month when purchasing a tax disc; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Refunds of motor tax can be made in circumstances where: the vehicle has been scrapped or destroyed or sent permanently out of the State; the vehicle has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner; a vehicle in respect of which a tax disc has been taken out has not been used in a public place at any time since the issue of the disc; the owner of the vehicle has ceased because of illness, injury or other physical disability to use the vehicle; or the owner of the vehicle has ceased because of absence from the State for business or educational purposes to use the vehicle or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of the service overseas with the Defence Forces, to use the vehicle. In addition, the regulations require, for administrative reasons, that not less than a three month unexpired period remains on the disc from the date of refund. The question of reducing this period will be considered at the next revision of the regulations.</P>

      <Quest>if it is his policy to abolish the city-county planning officer in the Dublin and Cork local authorities and to replace the post by a director of services - planning and development - position which does not require a professional qualification; if so, the rationale of this approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals are being finalised for the creation of strengthened local authority management structures to meet the demands of the introduction of a programme based system of administration and the abolition of the dual structure. Under these proposals, the posts of assistant county manager and county engineer will cease to exist. A new grade of director of services will be created at assistant county manager level and a number of these new posts will be filled by designation of the serving assistant managers and county engineers as directors of services. Each director of services will have responsibility for the management of all of the <Col N="434" /> staff, both technical and administrative, dealing with the functions assigned to him or her. The position regarding all other posts will be a matter for consideration by individual managers in consultation with their own staff during local discussions on the implementation of the new structures. However, I understand that proposals currently under discussion in the Dublin county councils and Cork corporation involve the suppression of the county and city planning officer posts in favour of the creation of director of services posts with the wider management remit. The new structures proposed will not result in any diminution in the level or quality of the planning advice available to local authorities. Under the new arrangements, the planning function will be headed up by a director of service at management level who will oversee both the technical and administrative staff. The new structures will have adequate numbers of senior planning staff to deal with technical matters.</P>

      <P>There is no scheme currently available specifically to house emigrants from Ireland who wish to return home. Many who wish to return home are in a position to provide housing from their own resources. Others, however, may need to apply to a local authority or approved voluntary housing organisation for assistance in meeting their housing needs. Applications or inquiries about eligibility for local authority housing should be directed by the individual to the local authority in whose functional area they wish to reside. Information on accommodation provided by approved voluntary housing organisations may be obtained from the Irish Council for Social Housing, 84 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, which is the representative organisation for the voluntary and non-profit housing sector.</P>

      <P>The law governing the planning system is set out in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1999, and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 to 2000. Article 34 of these regulations provides that any person or body may make submissions or observations in writing to a planning authority in relation to a planning application.</P>
      <P>Article 36 provides that an individual is entitled to view, free of charge, all documents submitted with a planning application at the planning authority's office during office hours from the date of receipt of the application until the decision made on it. These documents include a copy of the planning application concerned and of any drawings, maps, particulars, evidence, environmental impact statement, other written study or further information received or obtained by them from the applicant. Internal reports on the application, prepared by or on behalf of the planning authority, are available for inspection or for copying once the planning authority decision has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full file on any planning decision, including any report submitted to the manager, is available for public inspection for the life of the permission, usually five years, unless extended. Many planning authorities keep older files available but charge a fee for retrieving them from their <Col N="438" /> archives. Copies of documents from any planning file can be purchased for a reasonable fee related to copying costs.</P>

      <P>One of the key objectives of the Government's housing strategy is to moderate house price increases and restore balance to the housing market. To this end, the Government has implemented a wide range of measures to boost housing output, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development and improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households. Earlier this year, I commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review developments in the housing market and to make recommendations for action required to bring supply more in line with demand and improve housing affordability, especially for first-time buyers. In parallel with this study, my Department reviewed the range of social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Following consideration of the consultants' findings and the review, the Government approved a comprehensive package of measures &ndash; Action on Housing &ndash; which was launched on 15 June, copies of which have been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>My Department's latest house price data for the March quarter 2000 were published on 26 June. Nationally, new house prices rose by 1.6% on the December 1999 quarter average, while second-hand house prices were down 0.3% over the same period. The March quarter figures for Dublin are showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand homes respectively.</P>
    <P>As the measures undertaken to maximise supply increasingly take effect and reinforce the progress made to date, there are good prospects that house price trends will moderate further in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1996 my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines specifically recommend that only as a last resort and if all alternatives were unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools. Given the concern expressed during the public consultation process on the guidelines, a statement on health and safety aspects which the Departments of Health and Children and Public Enterprise agreed with my Department, was included as an appendix to the guidelines. Health aspects are dealt with by requiring operators, as part of their planning application, to furnish to the planning authority a statement of compliance with international radiation protection association guidelines.</P>
      <P>The health effects of masts and base stations are a matter for the Department of Health and Children while the monitoring of emissions from masts and base stations is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>

    <P>Comhairle</P>
    <P>Comhairle was established on 12 June, 2000 under the Comhairle Act, 2000. This new organisation has responsibility for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for all citizens throughout the country, including people with disabilities. It combined the National Social Service Board, NSSB, with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board, NRB. Most, 18 of the 20 members, had been serving as members of the NSSB board which was expanded in anticipation of Comhairle to accommodate five additional members nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to represent the interests of people with disabilities. It was necessary to finally reappoint them to the board of Comhairle on its establishment so they all fall into the category of members appointed in 2000. The Comhairle Act, 2000, provides that the membership of the board must comprise at least eight men and eight women. Twelve members are male and eight members are female. This represents a 60:40 gender balance.</P>
    <P>The number of appointments made to the former National Social Services Board &ndash; and its successor the Comhairle Board &ndash; and the male-female ratio for the years 1997-2000 is as follows:&ndash;</P>

      <P>There is one directive relating to my Department which remains to be transposed into Irish law. This is Council Directive 98/49/EC on the safeguarding of the supplementary pension rights of employed and self employed persons moving within the European Community, which was adopted on 29 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The directive primarily deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative arrangements necessary to comply with the directive not later than 25 July 2001.</P>
      <P>In order to comply with the terms of the directive, an amendment to the Pensions Act is necessary. This amendment will be incorporated into the new Pensions Bill, which I expect to</P>
      <P>publish later this summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
      <P>The latest ESRI figures from the living in Ireland survey show that the percentage of children experiencing consistent poverty fell from 18-23% in 1994 to 15-17% in 1997, while the numbers living in households below the 50% relative income line fell from 29% in 1994 to 24% in 1997. While figures from the living in Ireland survey in respect of 1998 are expected to be available from the ESRI shortly, it should be noted that much of the data available on child poverty in Ireland relates to the early to mid-1990s and the rate of child poverty has fallen in the late 1990s, as recognised in the Combat Poverty Agency's submission to the National Children's Strategy. For example, while the Combat Poverty Agency submission stated that in 1994, Ireland had the highest share of children, under 16, in households below half average income at 30%, substantially ahead of the EU average of 19%, increases in employment in recent years have had a significant impact on this figure. Having said that, this Government recognises that much still needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The PPF provides an opportunity to progress a number of policies in relation to the needs of children. Under the terms of framework III of the programme, new targets will be considered in consultation with the social partners under the National Anti-poverty Strategy framework, including child poverty. The programme also provides for the strengthening of child protection services.</P>
      <P>This Government shares the view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2000 budget provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates of child benefit, resulting in a full year increase of some £106 million, bringing the total provision in 2000 to a record £504.6 million. In addition, the PPF contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children. The PPF also provides for the establishment a working group on the benchmarking and indexation of adult and child social <Col N="453" /> welfare rates and this group is due to be established shortly.</P>
    <P>The best way out of poverty, for both adults and children, is employment. It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. The unemployment rate is now well below the EU average and the live register has fallen by over 93,000 since we took up office in June 1997.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than the live register as a whole and employment opportunities have increased. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Government Departments are poverty proofed to ensure that the needs of children, among other target groups, are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>

      <P>There was a total of 78,627 people in receipt of an old age contributory pension at the end of May 2000. In addition, there were 78,937 recipients of a retirement pension.</P>
      <P>Old age contributory pension and retirement pension are social insurance payments made to people reaching the age of 66 and 65 respectively. These pensions are not means tested and therefore entitlement is not affected by other income including income from employment. Accordingly, this Department does not hold data on the current employment status of recipients of these pensions. It should be noted that entitlement to retirement pension from the age of 65 is based on the claimant being retired from employment. This retirement condition no longer applies on reaching age 66.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of community development support <Col N="454" /> programmes, namely, a community development programme; a family and community services resource centre programme; and a programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these programmes is to provide seed money to enable locally based community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging needs. The programmes are concerned with promoting positive change in society in favour of those who benefit least from economic development and are focused primarily on enhancing the capacity of those experiencing poverty and disadvantage to participate more effectively in society.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work.</P>
      <P>The once-off grants are: a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations; a community development education and training grants scheme; and a scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are some 50 money advice and budgeting service projects supported by my Department around the country at present. These projects provide an advice and budget management service to people in difficulty with moneylending and over indebtedness.</P>
      <P>Details of all grants made under the various schemes-programmes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year to 1999 for the information of members. Details of the 2000 grants will likewise be made available early in 2001.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 330 and 334 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of May 2000, there were 15,380 carer's allowances in payment. When this Government came to office three years ago, there were approximately 9,200 people in receipt of carer's allowance. This represents an increase of 67% in the number of carers receiving the allow<Col N="455" /> ance during that period. Again when this Government came to office in 1997, expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, an increase of 115%.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published by my Department in October 1998, a range of measures have been introduced in the last two budgets to improve and develop the position of carers, as follows:</P>
    <P>April 1999 &ndash; extension of the free travel scheme to carers caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance; credited contributions to be awarded to eligible carers and to carers caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance.</P>
    <P>June 1999 &ndash; rate increase; annual payment of £200 towards respite care.</P>
    <P>August 1999 &ndash; extension of carer's allowance to carers of those between 16 and 65 years and to those caring for recipients of domiciliary care allowance; extension of free telephone rental allowance to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance; application of £75 means disregard to the income of a single carer and £150 to the joint income of a married carer; relaxation of residency rule; relaxation of full-time care and attention rule to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid employment for up to ten hours per week.</P>
    <P>April 2000 &ndash; carers getting carer's allowance or caring for people getting constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance no longer required to satisfy 13 paid contribution rule when claiming disability benefit.</P>
    <P>May 2000 &ndash; rate increase.</P>
    <P>June 2000 &ndash; annual respite care grant to be increased by £100 to £300.</P>
    <P>September 2000 &ndash; back to education allowance scheme to be extended to carers after ceasing caring responsibilities.</P>
    <P>October 2000 &ndash; introduction of carer's benefit scheme; free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes to be extended to carers in receipt of a carer's allowance and to those caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. These extensions ensure that carers will qualify for all free schemes from October.</P>
    <P>The review considered that the objectives of the carer's allowance scheme are designed for full-time carers and that part-time caring situations envisaged by the Deputy were not, therefore, covered by these objectives.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the many improvements which have been made in recent budgets, the position of carers is being kept under review. Further changes will be considered in the context of our</P>
    <P>key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for participation in the students summer jobs scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test which applies to applicants for unemployment assistance. In assessing means, account is taken of the parent's gross income less income tax, PRSI, superannuation, private health insurance, union fees, rent or mortgage payments and some travel costs. The weekly means of the student are then assessed at 17% of the net family income calculated on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 335 together.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, to provide a mechanism to allow women who take time out from the paid workforce for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes. This recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home can face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
      <P>Certain measures have already been introduced to address this issue. Under the homemakers scheme, introduced in 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
      <P>The pro-rata pensions which I introduced in November 1997 and the new arrangements to take account of pre-1953 contributions, which came into effect from 5 May this year, will also benefit many women who have gaps in their PRSI records because of time spent working full-time in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in this area and, as I have previously indicated, I have ordered a review of the arrangements which are already in place. Accordingly, an examination of the homemakers scheme will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pen<Col N="458" /> sions. I have asked that proposals be brought forward which can be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme operates this year from 1 June to 30 September during which approved students will be allowed undertake 200 hours work in community based projects at £3 per hour, giving a total maximum payment of £600.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation and therefore the minimum wage will not apply. The work carried out by students under the scheme is of a community nature and it cannot be compared with normal commercial type activity. It is not my intention to increase the hourly rate of pay this year.</P>

      <P>She was interviewed by a local officer on 14 March 2000 in connection with her application. On 24 May 2000 she was asked to forward her birth and marriage certificates and also, to supply evidence of her efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse, within 21 days.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned failed to forward the necessary documentation, her application for one-parent family payment was disallowed on 19 June 2000.

      <P>The person concerned, who is currently in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension at the rate of £79.50 per week, informed the Department on 4 January, 2000 that she won a car and £17,000 in the winning streak lottery show. She accepted £10,000 cash in lieu of the car and therefore received a total of £27,000 in cash. Having purchased a car and carried out house improvements, etc., the person concerned was assessed with means of £10.09 per week from <Col N="461" /> the £9,000 balance retained. This resulted in a reduction of £6 per week in her rate of old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Old age non-contributory pension is a means tested payment and all sources of income are assessed as means. However, the actual income received, £27,000 in this case, was not assessed.</P>
      <P>Instead, the balance retained, £9,000, was treated as capital and assessed under a standard formula. Under the current formula used to calculate means from capital, the first £2,000, single or widowed, is disregarded and the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5%.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements will be introduced shortly to the manner in which means from capital is assessed. With effect from 13 October 2000, the first £10,000 of capital will be disregarded in the case of single or widowed pensioners, £20,000 in the case of a couple.</P>
      <P>The claim of the person concerned will be reviewed in advance of 13 October, 2000 and she will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>During the period 21 April, 1998 to 18 June, 2000 my Department has received a total of 1,148 requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. In addition to this 87 requests were received by the social welfare appeals office.</P>

    <P>The majority of these requests were for personal records. A small percentage, 8% in 1998 rising to 12% in this year, were for information of a non-personal nature.</P>
    <P>The volume of requests received, and the proportion of requests that relate to personal information, is in line with what was expected. Over the above period, the average number of requests received weekly has risen from 8.5 to 13.3.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> Many of the requests are time-consuming, both in the process of search and retrieval and in examination of the records requested. The requests for information of a non-personal nature in particular have caused additional pressures on staff in the relevant sections, but I am pleased with the way my Department has responded to the responsibilities imposed by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of any request for assistance or advice in respect of this property and, as a consequence, I have no information on the future plans for it.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in 1998 the Government decided on a new framework to protect the architectural heritage of the State that placed the primary responsibility in this regard on planning authorities. Funding was subsequently made available for the planning authorities to recruit conservation officers. A scheme of grants for the conservation of protected structures was also introduced. The new system was given legislative effect through the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. A number of seminars were held for planning authorities last year to outline the revised arrangements and their enhanced role in the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities and that my role is mainly to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. With effect from 1 January, 2000, any buildings that had been listed for preservation or protection in Dublin Corporation's development plan, including Cullenswood House, were deemed to be included on the new record of protected structures. It is, accordingly, a matter for Dublin Corporation, in the first instance, to take whatever action it considers appropriate, consistent with its new powers, to protect the architectural integrity of this building.</P>
      <P>The new Act also places a responsibility on the owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure that the structure or any part of it, which contributes to its special interest, is not endangered in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for implementation of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives. These directives were transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Conservation of Wild Birds) Regulations, 1985 (S.I. No. 291 of 1985), and the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97).</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has instituted legal proceedings against Ireland for the non-transmission of the full list of special areas of conservation required under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office, 197 proposed candidate special areas of conservation had been publicly advertised, but no sites were formally transmitted to the EU Commission. I came to the conclusion that inadequate consultation with landowners had taken place and that sites should not be transmitted until this was remedied. I established an appeals advisory board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and consisting of equal representation from landowner and conservation organisations. I also encouraged the setting up of landowners' liaison committees.</P>
      <P>I have since publicly advertised an additional 168 sites and formally transmitted 267 sites to the EU Commission. I anticipate that outstanding sites will be formally transmitted to the EU Commission by the end of the year. All sites receive full protection under national legislation once publicly advertised.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has also instituted legal proceedings against Ireland, arising from the terms of the birds directive, in respect of overgrazing, particularly in regard to the Owenduff/Nephin Beg site and the decline in the red grouse population. These proceedings are being vigorously defended.</P>

      <P>The position in this case is that Dúchas waterways referred the matter last year to the Chief State Solicitor's office for advice and appropriate action. However, the developer subsequently submitted for planning permission a proposal for a housing development on the site. Dúchas waterways section objected to the proposed development. A meeting was held with the developer's architect and agreement was reached on the items to be resolved. This included his agreement to contact the neighbour's solicitor to address her concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy may be aware, Dúchas waterways section, is no longer within the direct <Col N="469" /> remit of my Department as it now comes under the aegis of Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, which was established on 2 December, 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement. Accordingly, I have to advise the Deputy that the matter raised by him is one for consideration by Waterways Ireland who have advised me that the legal issues to which he refers have not yet been resolved.</P>

      <P>I should point out, at the outset, that following detailed discussions between officials of my Department, the Department of Environment and Local Government and the relevant local authorities I was recently in a position to announce the grant allocations in respect of the improvement of strategic Gaeltacht roads for this year. This year is the first year of a seven year plan, the objective of which, when completed, is having one good road of suitable standard into every Gaeltacht area. I have personally indicated this policy objective in my meetings with the relevant local authorities earlier this year, and have also explained to them that the additional funding, which I have secured for this purpose during the duration of the national development plan, is in addition to the funding which would normally be available to the relevant local authorities for the improvement of the roads in question. In this context, officials from my Department will be in contact with the relevant local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the near future in order to prepare a plan for next year and subsequent years as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I have responded to a number of similar questions on this issue already and the position remains broadly unchanged from that outlined in my response to the most recent one, Question No. 460 dated 10 May 2000.</P>
      <P>Two of the three local authorities concerned have yet to complete the legal transfer documents but I am pleased to confirm that all of the Local Authorities have now confirmed acceptance of the conditions governing development funding secured by my Department over the next five years for the demesne. A principal condition is that the demesne be opened to the public as early as possible.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware the proposals do not provide for a footbridge over the Lucan by-pass.</P>
      <P>The question of implementing the development proposals and the time scale for public access is primarily a matter for the three local authorities concerned. Consequently these issues are best addressed by those local authorities <i>viz</i>. Fingal, Kildare and South Dublin.</P>

      <P>The planning authority notified my Department in November 1999 about this planning application for outline planning permission. This is a statutory obligation placed on them by Section 32 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 to 1999. A departmental archaeologist assessed the proposed development and a report/recommendations was submitted to the planning authority in January 2000. The report advised that, subject to certain archaeological mitigation measures, the Department had no objection to the proposed development. The planning authority subsequently sought confirmation of the report-recommendations and this was given to them in February 2000. I understand the planning authority recently decided to refuse to grant permission for the proposed development. Such decision is a matter solely for the planning authority under the local government planning and development code and neither my Department nor I are parties to such decision making process other than to offer advice and make recommendations to them. I am arranging to have a copy of the Department's reports-recommendations to be forwarded for the information of the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360, 386 and 387 together.</P>
      <P>Any student who is a national of an European economic area state, comprising the 15 EU member states together with Iceland, Liechenstein and Norway, is entitled to work in the State without a work permit. In so far as the employment of non-EEA students is concerned, it has been the long-standing position that they are not entitled to take up employment while pursuing a course of studies here, with the exception of any work experience required as an integral part of their course of studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure whereby non-EEA students may renew their permission to remain in the State <Col N="475" /> is a relatively straightforward one. Provided such persons have not entered the State on a visa which is restricted to a 90 day maximum stay, a &lsquo;C' type visa, they may obtain permission to remain as a student from their local Garda registration office. They will be required to show that they are enrolled in a full time course of study, that they have paid the fees in full for the course and that they have sufficient funds to support themselves for the duration of their stay.</P>
    <P>Information regarding these matters is widely available, including in an information note issued by my Department. I am not aware that any lack of information is exposing students to abuse but I would be concerned if this was the case and if the Deputy has more specific information in this regard I would certainly be anxious to review it</P>
    <P>I am aware that such students could, potentially, provide a further pool of people for part-time and seasonal work. My concern is that to permit such students to take up employment when they would not otherwise be entitled to do so without a work permit might exacerbate whatever level of abuse already exists in the system and perhaps encourage the illegitimate trade in student visas to which the Deputy refers. There would clearly be an unwelcome incentive for a person whose real objective is to access the labour market to enrol in a course or to prolong their attendance at a course, simply to be able to remain in employment here.</P>
    <P>In general, the arrangements relating to the residence of non-EEA students in the State work well and facilitate genuine persons who wish to study here. There is, however, a certain amount of abuse of these procedures by persons who primary intention is to obtain employment rather than to study. While the Garda have statutory powers to enforce compliance with immigration law generally, I am arranging for the introduction of an additional requirement in the registration process whereby students must be in a position to show that their attendance to date has been satisfactory. Persons not in a position to do so will be asked to justify any continued extension of their permission to remain. It is my intention, at any rate, to keep this matter under review, in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The selection criteria for the recruitment of Garda trainees are prescribed by regulation and are reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department. With regard to the requirement for leaving certificate Irish, this element of the minimum educational qualifications was last reviewed and revised in 1997 following a significant restructuring of the leaving certificate programme and the introduction of Irish at foundation level for leaving certificate students. There are no plans to abolish Irish or make it an optional requirement for Garda recruitment. Members of the Garda Síochána are required to provide a broad and increasing range of services to all sections of society and may be called upon at any time to communicate with the public in Irish, either orally or in writing.</P>
      <P>Persons originally from Northern Ireland are not precluded from sitting the leaving certificate. Furthermore, qualifications in Irish in an examination other than the leaving certificate may be recognised where such other examination is of a standard not lower than the standard of the leaving certificate examinations of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 Garda recruitment competition two applicants requested the Irish version of the application form and in the 1998 competition four applicants requested the Irish version. I have been advised by the Garda authorities that as they do not record the religion of applicants, the number of Protestant members in the Garda Síochána is not available.</P>

      <P>The law on domestic violence has been the subject of a comprehensive review which took into account detailed consultations on the legal and constitutional issues involved. That review led to the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 which updated and re-enacted, with substantial amendments, the legislation of 1981. Operation of the law in this area is being closely monitored by my Department in consultation with, among others, the national steering committee on violence against women. Where changes in the law are found to be feasible and warranted I shall include them in the proposed family law Bill, which is in the Government's legislation programme.</P>
      <P>The following is the most up to date information sought on applications to the District Court under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 as supplied by District Court offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 400 together.</P>
      <P>The recent tragic events in Dover where 58 people lost their lives have drawn further attention to the necessity for international co-operation in the context of illegal immigration generally. Because the vast majority of asylum seekers arrive in the State via the United Kingdom or France, the Government recognises that a strengthening of international liaison with those countries is important in identifying immigration trends and flows and co-ordinating immigration related activities both at a policy level and at a day to day operational level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agreed on 8 May 2000 as part of a number of measures agreed in relation to asylum, refugees and immigration matters, approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by the placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement <Col N="479" /> authorities on immigration matters and in that regard, with particular emphasis on combating trafficking activity and on departures from major embarkation points to Ireland. I met the UK Home Secretary on 12 June 2000 and the French Interior Minister on 19 June 2000, the latter meeting taking place just as the tragic events in Dover were unfolding. I secured the agreement of both Ministers to the proposed placement of the officers in question and to their interaction on a pro-active basis with the relevant French and UK authorities on immigration matters generally, with particular emphasis on combating trafficking activity. The officers in question will have a critical role to play in maintaining liaison between our immigration and police services on issues concerning illegal immigration and in particular on liaison between police and immigration services at ports and airports.</P>
    <P>I Intend that this type of liaison will continue and be developed. A further meeting at official level has been arranged with the United Kingdom and is in the course of being arranged with the French authorities. In so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, consideration must also be taken of the existence of the common travel area which results in the imposition of occasional rather than systematic immigration controls. The common travel area between the respective jurisdictions is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and Irish people generally.</P>
    <P>The Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Bill which,<i> inter alia,</i> provides for severe penalties for any person who knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe is an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum received its final approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas on 22 June 2000. The penalties in <Col N="480" /> question include an unlimited fine, up to 10 years' imprisonment and the forfeiture of vehicles.</P>

      <P>The Garda Commissioner and I are totally committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse, including heroin abuse. The Government's policy of tough legislation, backed up by strong law enforcement measures, in tandem with a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage will ultimately prove sucessful.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are successfully targeting the problem of drug dealing at both a national and local level. Between January, 1998 and December, 1999, drug seizures amounting to an estimated street value in excess of £120 million were made. In the same period, Garda operations, such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, to combat on-street drug dealing were also extremely effective resulting in the seizure of illicit drugs with an estimated street value in excess of £20 million and in over 20,000 arrests being made.</P>
      <P>Preliminary figures for significant drug seizures indicate that drug seizures amounting to an estimated street value in excess of £5 million were made in the first quarter of 2000. Provisional figures for Operation Dóchas indicate that illicit drugs with an estimated street value of over £1.2 million were seized and over 2,000 arrests were made between 1 January and 16 April, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the use of heroin in the Dublin area is continually monitored by the Garda national drugs unit and <Col N="488" /> city centre drug units. Known drug traffickers continue to be targeted and when evidence becomes available they are dealt with in accordance with the relevant legislation. Specialist operations are undertaken and a special operation &ndash; Operation Clean Street Phase V was recently undertaken by the Garda national drugs unit. International co-operation is enlisted by the Garda Síochána when appropriate and has contributed to a number of arrests and seizures.</P>

      <P>The Human Rights Act provides that the Human Rights Commission will have nine members including its president and it specifies that at least four members of the commission will be men and that at least four members will be women. The Act also emphasises the importance of pluralism in the making of such appointments, and it stipulates in line with a requirement in the 1993 UN Paris Principles, that the members of the commission should have some background in, or connection with, human rights. The membership of the commission must also reflect the nature of Irish society.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention that the members of the commission, including the president, will be appointed in accordance with these criteria as soon as possible to meet the commitment made in the joint statement to the parties in Northern Ireland dated 5 May 2000.

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services was established in November, 1999 under the aegis of my Department with responsibility, <i>inter alia, </i>for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Due to the acute shortage of accommodation in Dublin, the Government decided that newly arrived asylum seekers should be dispersed throughout the country. Prior to this, most asylum seekers had been accommodated in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy, the directorate is assessing the potential of accommodation offers in all regions throughout the State. In line with normal practice, details of particular properties are not released until such time as the arrangements in relation to them have been agreed and relevant legal formalities concluded with the proprietors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of the directorate to organise information meetings, to which local public representatives are invited, at all locations where it is proposed to accommodate asylum seekers. Such meetings take place before asylum seekers are accommodated in the selected localities. The directorate strives at all times to inform local communities as early as possible of the impending arrival of asylum seekers. Initially, the time avail<Col N="490" /> able for consultations was extremely limited because of the relatively large numbers of asylum seekers coming to Ireland and the shortage of suitable accommodation for them. As more accommodation comes on stream however, the time available for consultations is increasing and I would expect the position in this regard to improve further over time.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate that the total number of asylum applicants awaiting a final determination on their asylum applications as at 31 May 2000 is approximately 12,500, of which in the region of 80% reside in Dublin. The Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has been responsible since 10 April last for accommodating asylum seekers, and for giving effect to the Government decision that the accommodation needs of new arrivals be met by dispersal throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In determining the suitability of accommodation for families, account is taken of the requirement for <i>en suite </i>rooms, mother and children rooms, play areas, designated rooms for the provision of tailored health services on site and an overall spacious environment which meets the additional safety needs of children.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers are entitled to a range of services while waiting to have their applications processed. For example, subject to satisfying means tests, asylum seekers are entitled to allowances, including allowances in respect of children, under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and medical cards. They are entitled to the same services as Irish medical card holders. The children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education. These services are provided by a number of different Government Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>The processing of applications from unaccompanied minors, of which there are 121 on hand at 31 May 2000, has a number of child specific features and has regard to the UNHCR's guidelines on policies and procedures in dealing with unaccompanied children seeking asylum as well as the relevant paragraph's of the UNHCR's procedures handbook and the EU Council Resolution of Unaccompanied Minors who are Nationals of Third Countries &ndash;  26 June 1997. In this regard, departmental policy is not to interview unaccompanied minors seeking asylum unless accompanied by a guardian. The question of appointment of a guardian is a matter for the relevant health board. Interviews are carried out by personnel specifically trained for this purpose.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> I have arranged with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, for the establishment of a working group, to ensure effective liaison and co-operation between our respective Departments and the relevant health boards and to ensure adherence to highest international standards in dealing with unaccompanied minors who seek asylum in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1998, I established the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. The committee is a partnership of non-governmental organisations, State agencies, social partners and Departments. Its overall aim is to develop an integrated approach against racism and to encourage integrated action towards the promotion of a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees, Travellers and minority ethnic groups in Ireland. The NCCRI is funded by my Department and it has been allocated £150,000 to fund its programme of activities in 2000. It has also been provided with an office and facilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees, which was published last December, emphasised the importance of promoting a tolerant inclusive society. The working group's report has been accepted by Government as the framework for refugee integration policy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations of the working group related to public awareness. The group recommended that the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism should have a central role in co-ordinating public awareness initiatives and in disseminating information on anti-racism issues and respect for cultural diversity. The Government has agreed on the need for initiatives to combat racism and racist attacks through informing public opinion and promoting a more tolerant inclusive society. It has approved proposals for an evaluation of the working group strategy and the resources needed to plan, implement and review the development of such initiatives, within a very short time frame. The NCCRI is carrying out this evaluation. The evaluation is due to be completed soon and I intend to bring proposals for comprehensive public awareness initiatives to Government within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCCRI assists the integration of refugees in other ways. Its programme includes the moni<Col N="492" /> toring of the legal aid service for asylum seekers, organising anti-racism training modules for civil servants and administering a small grants fund to non-government organisations undertaking anti-racism/intercultural projects. The NCCRI has a number of sub-committees, one of which deals exclusively with issues concerning refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Last November the NCCRI, in conjunction with the UNHCR, organised a programme of events which focused on the inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers, people of colour and ethnic minorities into Irish society. The two-week programme, entitled True Colours consisted of a wide range of different types of events at national, regional and local levels, including a film festival, workshops, seminars and the launching of publications. The organisers encouraged the participation of community groups, schools and other organisations and a small grant fund was set up to support non-statutory groups who became involved in the programme</P>
    <P>In its strategic plan for 2000-02, the NCCRI states that it will seek to build on its previous work on refugee and asylum policy and to develop new competencies on immigration and citizenship policy. In particular the NCCRI will seek to work towards the active inclusion of refugees in integration policy and develop mechanisms for the participation of organisations working with minority ethnic groups in the design, implementation and review of service delivery.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, came into operation last October. The Act provides protection against discrimination in employment and training on a number of grounds including religion, race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins. The Equal Status Act, 2000, will provide protection from discrimination outside the employment context &ndash; including education, in the provision of goods, services and accommodation and the disposal of property &ndash; on the same grounds as the Employment Equality Act. The Equal Status Act was signed by the President on the 26 April and it is my intention to commence the Act in October when the appropriate resources are in place.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's query relates to persons who are the victims of international trafficking for the purposes of sexual or similarly oppressive types of exploitation. The need to give special consideration to granting residence permission on a humanitarian basis to such persons has been identified in a number of <Col N="493" /> international fora as an important element of an overall strategy to deal with this problem.

      <P>I intend to keep this matter under ongoing review, having regard to developments at international level and in particular the proposed UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which is currently being negotiated.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a review will be undertaken of the overall structures for the monitoring and implementation of present commitments in relation to gender equality under the Beijing Platform for Action, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has started work on the development of a national action plan for gender equality for 2000-05. Consultation with NGOs <Col N="494" /> will be an important aspect of the plan. Enhancement of consultation structures was the theme of a national forum which my Department held recently in Dublin Castle for non-governmental organisations. It is envisaged that a draft plan will be drawn up later this year and that a process of consultation will then ensue.</P>
    <P>All Departments will be asked to provide details of targets to implement the Beijing Platform for Action, including benchmarks and time scales, for inclusion in the national plan. The question of allocation of further resources, if necessary, will be addressed when these targets have been outlined and indicators identified.   </P>
    <P>My Department has also commissioned research to develop mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality in Ireland and indicators for use in measuring the practical impact of policies and programmes on the status of women and to meet gender monitoring requirements under various national and international commitments. The development of the national action plan will be informed by this research, which is due to be completed within the next month or so.

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this application refers to a transfer of part which was lodged on 25 June 1996 and completed on 31 December 1999. The Deputy will appreciate that the Land Registry operates a system of registration of title whereby all relevant particulars concerning the land and its ownership are entered on special registers call folios maintained in the Land Registry. A folio takes the place of a large number of documents comprising title deeds in respect of unregistered property. Title deeds are retained in the Land Registry for proof of ownership purposes. A certified copy of the folio which will show the ownership details may be obtained, by application, on payment of the specified fee.</P>

The Act of 1988 already gives a right to persons to establish the existence of computerised data held on them by a data controller and to have access to any such data. Implementation of the directive by way of the necessary legislative provisions will extend the principle of data protection to manual data including the right to establish the existence of such data and to have access to it.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that <Col N="500" /> the number of people on waiting lists for appointments with solicitors on 31 May 2000 is 2,296, which is a very substantial improvement on the figure of 3,542 at 31 May 1999. The number of people on waiting lists at each of the 30 full-time law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board in May of each year since 1996 is set out in the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board this year to address the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times. I am confident that these additional resources will, in time, result in an improvement in the situation in relation to waiting times at legal aid centres.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the Legal Aid Board, in April 1998, introduced a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases where urgency is a factor, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction, and cases where there is a danger that the time limits for issuing proceedings may expire. I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that priority is accorded to judicial review cases because of the nature of the proceedings and the time limits involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area for a number of years. This scheme was extended on a nationwide basis earlier this year. The private practitioner scheme provides a complementary legal service to that which is available from law centres. This complementary service relates to certain family law matters in the District Court namely, domestic violence, maintenance and custody/access. This scheme, while increasing the services provided by the board, enables the law centres to devote more resources to non-District Court matters and helps in reducing waiting times in law centres.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this application refers to a <Col N="502" /> section 49 application, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 which was lodged on 28 March 2000.</P>
      <P>I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a precise completion date for the application concerned at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that the application is being expedited by the Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department allocated a grant of £5,000 this year to the organisation <Col N="503" />&ldquo;Women in the Home&rdquo; for development activities and, in addition, provided funding towards the attendance of a representative of that organisation at the UN General Assembly Special Session &ndash; Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century (Beijing + 5). &ldquo;Women in the Home&rdquo; aims to provide support and a forum for women working in the home through which they can have a voice and influence society.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department in relation to child care relates to services provided by third parties to parents for the care of their children. Child care services are availed of not only by women who are participating in the labour force; the findings of a survey conducted in 1998 by the ESRI on behalf of the Commission on the Family indicate that one in five households with children aged four years or less use the services of a crèche-nursery and that in almost half of these households the mother worked full-time in the home, suggesting a wish for the children to participate in pre-school services. My Department has been supporting the development of child care service provision since 1994 from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. Many of the projects supported provide low cost child care services to women in disadvantaged areas who wish to take up employment, training or education opportunities. The National Development Plan 2000-06 provides £250 million to my Department to invest in the development of child care service provision under a range of support measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment, including access to employment, on nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act should facilitate women who wish to give up their employment to care for their children full time in the home and who, at a later stage, wish to return to paid employment. In particular, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of age will ensure that such women will have the option of re-entering the labour force once they have reared their children. In addition, funding provided in the national development plan for my Department for positive action for women includes an element for assistance for women returning to the labour force after long absences rearing their children. These initiatives are complemented by work being done by my colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Minister for Finance has introduced the home carers' allowance, which is a new tax allowance of up to £3,000 per annum at the standard rate of income tax. This may be claimed by married couples, who are jointly assessed and where one spouse, the &ldquo;home carer&rdquo; cares for one or more dependent persons which includes children, the aged or incapacitated persons. The Minister for <Col N="504" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs has ordered a review of the arrangements already in place under the homemakers scheme. This review will be undertaken by his Department as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, provides an individual and non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. This legislation will facilitate both parents to dedicate a short period to the full time care of young children.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000, provides protection against both direct and indirect discrimination outside the field of employment. Married women in the home can benefit from this legislation. The Act deals with discrimination on the same nine grounds already mentioned in relation to the employment equality legislation. The Act covers provision of goods and services, disposal of premises and accommodation, education and registered clubs. The Act applies to goods and services which are available to the public, whether on payment or not, and irrespective of whether provided by the public sector or private sector. It is my intention to bring the Act into operation in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000 provides protection to married women in the home on several of the specified grounds of discrimination, namely, the gender ground; the marital status ground; and the family status ground.</P>
    <P>As regards the family status ground, the Act defines this status as being pregnant or having responsibility for a person under 18 years, or as the parent or the resident primary carer of a person with a disability although over that age, where the disability is of such a nature that the person requires care or support on a continuing, regular or frequent basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that the level of indictable crime in the Enfield sub-district has remained static over the past four years, with 51 crimes reported in 1996, and 48 reported in 1999. With regard to Garda patrols in the area, I am informed that patrol cars are attached to Trim, Enfield, Sum<Col N="505" /> merhill and Ballivor stations. I am further informed that Garda patrols in Enfield are supplemented by the Trim district uniform patrol car, the detective branch car, and when the need arises, by members from Ballivor and Summerhill stations. The Garda authorities are satisfied that these arrangements are sufficient to meet the patrolling needs of the area.</P>
      <P>I understand that a traffic corps unit is currently based in Kells, and that another operates from Drogheda. I am informed that both adequately service the requirements of the Trim district. In relation to Garda strength, I am informed that the current manpower level of Trim district is 47, all ranks, but this number will be increased by one to 48, when a Garda will be transferred to Trim station in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the district Garda strength is deployed to meet the overall policing needs of the district as a whole, and to provide maximum cover to areas at risk to criminal activity. Garda strength is constantly monitored and the allocation of additional gardaí to areas is kept under review.</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, provides that it is an offence to have, in any public place, any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed. It is a defence for a person charged with this offence to prove that he or she had good reason or lawful authority for having the knife in a public place, or that he or she had the knife for use at work or for recreational purposes. The penalty on summary conviction for this offence is a fine of up to £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
      <P>It is also an offence under section 9 of the 1990 Act for a person to have, in any public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, a flick-knife or any other article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person. A person found guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.</P>

      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in <Col N="515" /> the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the Judge to exercise discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application. In so far as consistency of sentencing is concerned, I consider it important to mention that the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the director, to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission, which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Its report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report, which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £206,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
      <P>I might also mention that section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
      <P>The sixth report of the working group on a courts commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggests that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia</i>, provide a monitoring and analytical service on matters such as sentencing along the lines of the Judicial Commission in New South Wales. The chief justice established a judicial committee to consider, <i>inter alia,</i> the recommendations made in the working group report and the judicial committee has met on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the areas referred to in the Deputy's question are the subject of ongoing Garda attention from mobile, foot and community police and divisional task force patrols. I understand that all areas where there are particular ongoing problems are targeted, and the policing needs of these areas are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>It is not the general practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
      <P>However, the position in this instance is that the applicants were refused refugee status at first stage on the grounds that they did not qualify as refugees in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees as amended by the 1967 protocol and as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996 as amended. The applicants were informed of this decision on 26 August 1999.</P>
      <P>The applicants appealed the decision refusing them refugee status on 7 September 1999. In accordance with the Procedures for Processing Asylum Claims in Ireland, as amended, notified to UNHCR and in operation since 10 December 1997, the appeal will be determined by an independent appeals authority. Both applicants have requested an oral appeal hearing and it is expected that the hearing will be scheduled for a date in early September.</P>

      <P>In addition to providing for the registration of certain types of tourist accommodation, the Tourist Traffic Acts enable Bord Fáilte to publish, or cause to be published, lists of other forms of tourism accommodation premises, such as Bed and Breakfasts, which are not registered titles under the Acts. The system by which Bed and Breakfast accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to <Col N="522" /> be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business. However, statutory requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene, which are matters for the relevant local authorities, apply to all providers of tourist accommodation, whether listed or unlisted.</P>
      <P>Premises who wish to be listed and included in information literature distributed by Bord Fáilte offices internationally, through the Tourist Information Office network or the Gulliver information and reservations system, must comply with the requirements and criteria drawn up by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Initial inspections are carried out of all premises applying for listing and thereafter further inspections are carried out at least once in every two years of all listed premises. Following the 1994 AD Little review of Bord Fáilte, this listing function has been outsourced by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The criteria laid down by Bord Fáilte, in consultation with the bed and breakfast representative associations, are always subject to review in order to ensure that the highest international standards are met. The most recent such review was carried out last year with new criteria coming into force from January of this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 to 424, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the EU Commission guidelines, only one area in Ireland will benefit from support under the new URBAN II Initiative, with a maximum population of 20,000. The process of identifying potential candidate investment areas is already under way, in consultation with relevant agencies which are in a position to bring their expertise and experience to the process. It is intended that appropriate consultation will take place subsequently with the relevant local authorities in an effort to identify the areas with the potential and capacity to best take advantage of the support available through URBAN II. The Government will make the final decision as to the most appropriate site, in accordance with the criteria laid down in the guidelines.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): As the Deputy will already be aware, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
    <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy. Work on analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for the identification of levels of disadvantage in every responding school.</P>
    <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to primary schools where there are young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and/or extra funding which reflect the levels of need identified.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Approved courses for this purpose are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration, pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>
      <P>The 12 month conversion course in question does not meet the criteria for an approved course for the purposes of the student support schemes. Consequently, grant assistance under the schemes is not available in respect of this course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 to 448, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Support services are established by the in-career development unit of my Department for limited periods to provide inservice training for teachers involved in areas of substantial curriculum change. The periods in question would normally be of two to three years duration depending on the extent of the change.</P>
      <P>Following an extensive pilot phase of inservice, a support service for CSPE teachers was set up at the beginning of the 1996-97 school year for a period of three years to the end of the school year 1998-99. Following a review of the position at that stage, having regard to the fact that the subject was being newly examined as part of the junior certificate and the interest indicated generally by teachers and schools for some further support, the period was extended to four years as an exceptional matter.</P>
      <P>To date, the support service has provided an extensive programme of high quality inservice and other support in a variety of ways for the teachers concerned, involving the application of substantial personnel and financial resources. The considerable expertise developed by a large number of teachers through their involvement in providing this programme will facilitate greatly the provision of further courses on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers and schools will continue to be supported in a number of ways: a civic, social and political education teachers association was set up some time ago and my Department will be in consultation with that association concerning a programme of ongoing support for the teachers concerned to meet identified needs. The education centre network will be encouraged to respond in every way possible to demands for training from <Col N="534" /> CSPE teachers and schools. In addition my Department will respond positively to proposals from schools and other providers for training courses in this area.</P>
    <P>Funding has been provided for postgraduate CSPE courses for teachers in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, and in University College Cork. This funding will continue to be provided to meet future demand for these courses.</P>
    <P>Education departments in the universities have been developing and delivering CSPE as an elective in their higher diploma programmes with the assistance of the CSPE support services, and it is expected that they will further develop this area.</P>
    <P>CSPE is part of the core curriculum in the junior cycle. The possibility of offering an equivalent discipline in senior cycle is currently under consideration by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, as part of its review of the senior cycle. The council will report on the outcome of its deliberations to me in due course. In the meantime, it is expected that the ethos and skill developed in the CSPE programme at junior cycle level will permeate the life of schools as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the question of evaluation, there was an in-built evaluation element in the inservice programme provided and the feedback was extremely positive. Following the first examination in CSPE in the junior certificate 1999, a comprehensive chief examiner's report was issued. This contains information and advice for teachers and students of CSPE. In addition, plans for the implementation of a programme of whole school evaluation on a nationwide basis are being finalised. As part of WSE, various aspects of the schools' work, including curricular provision, will be evaluated. This will include the provision of CSPE.</P>
    <P>I am committed to doing everything possible to ensure the success of this important subject in schools and I will be keeping all aspects of its implementation under review.</P>

      <P>The objective of making our examination system more inclusive and more responsive to students with special needs is at the core of the report of the expert advisory group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> As Minister I do not regard it as acceptable that a special needs student should be penalised by being required to undergo assessment in an element of an examination which is beyond his or her physical capacity. For example the aural component of a language examination is clearly problematical for a deaf candidate and exemption from that component should therefore be possible in the case of such students.</P>
    <P>This year the concept of modification of the national standard assessment was introduced in order to accommodate the requirements of special needs students. Where this greater flexibility and responsiveness means that an element of the examination is not assessed then, as with all matters relating to the certificate examinations, this must occur openly and transparently.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to special arrangements are taken having regard to the circumstances of each individual case. My Department takes these decisions in the first instance within a framework of principles set out by the expert advisory group. I should stress that I have also ensured the availability of an independent appeal forum where a student is aggrieved with any aspect of my Department's decision.</P>

      <P>A Government decision of 26 July 1995 authorised my Department to proceed with the establishment of Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, TRBDI, including its establishment as a company limited by guarantee. The institute was incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, on 26 March 1998. The institute is now functioning with a board of directors in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
      <P>I consider it desirable that the institute be established on a statutory basis in common with other third level institutions. However, having regard to the Government's already heavy legislative programme it is not possible at present to give priority, in terms of resources or parliamentary time, to what would be a substantial piece of legislation.</P>

These appointments will bring the total number of psychologists in the agency to nearly 100. Further appointments will be made over the next few years to increase the number to 200 psychologists. The increased establishment will allow for an additional number of primary schools in the County Limerick area to be covered by NEPS in the near future.</P>

Indeed my Department has made considerable efforts over the years to support the development of the college within the limits of the resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the 1999-2000 academic year alone my <Col N="542" /> Department sanctioned 46 additional staff and the recurrent funding of the institute has increased by £1.9 million, or 14%, over last year alone. This represents quite a substantial increase in funding.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding has also been made available by my Department for the continued development of the institute's physical infrastructure. Recent and ongoing projects include: the library building; the apprenticeship building; the lecture theatres in the 1977 building; and general infrastructural improvements. Taken together, the recurrent and capital investment in WIT demonstrate a major commitment to the future development of the institute.</P>
    <P>The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the institute through both the provisions of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 and the Universities Act, 1997 to ensure the institute has the power to seek additional devolved authority.</P>
    <P>The institute of technology in Waterford will continue to play a major and growing role in Irish higher education. It has an important mission in the south east region which the Government intends to maintain and my Department will continue to play its role in its development and in ensuring that it has the facilities and resources to meet this challenge.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of a safe environment for children in schools is of paramount importance to me in all matters relating to child abuse and there can be no room for equivocation on the evils of paedophilia. This question, however, raises wider issues. Central to the question is the operation of an important element of the criminal justice system and the right of an accused person in a criminal trial to the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. The issuing of guidelines by my Department as proposed by the Deputy and any attempt in those guidelines to restrict the capacity of school principals to give evidence as witnesses in courts could be seen as an unconstitutional interference in the judicial process and an attempt by the State to prevent an accused person from presenting his or her best <Col N="543" /> defence as is his or her constitutional entitlement. For that reason I have reservations about the course proposed by the Deputy, especially since I am not aware of any general trend in principal teachers giving evidence of the kind referred to by the Deputy. However, if the Deputy has a specific case in mind which is causing her concern I will of course inquire into it if she provides me with the necessary details and I can then consider if schools need assistance in this matter and, if so, how that might be provided, having regard to the issues I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools. Work on analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for the identification of levels of disadvantage in every responding school.</P>
      <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to primary schools where there are young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and/or extra funding which reflect the levels of need identified. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the ISP, launched in December 1998, is to develop new procedures so as to ensure a more focused and co-ordinated response by statutory agencies to the needs of communities. The co-<Col N="544" /> ordination of all State services and agencies is crucial to optimising the benefits of services provided to families and individuals in these communities to tackle a wide range of issues such as inadequate housing, poor environment, low academic achievement, low self-esteem and, aimed at breaking the traditional inter-generational cycle of disadvantage experienced by families. Research has shown that those most at risk of not benefiting from the system are the children of unemployed people or the children of early school leavers. Educational achievement, therefore, both initial and second chance, is a key issue to be addressed within the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>Representatives from the schools within the ISP areas are participating in various task groups examining a range of priority needs as identified by the communities themselves, such as early school leaving, childcare, family support, the needs of older people and youth services etc. These task groups are planning and implementing a co-ordinated response to tackling these priorities. The actions are focused and targeted and allow the schools to play their part and contribute to a more holistic approach to the needs of children and of families within these communities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is the lead Department for the ISP and has engaged consultants to monitor and evaluate the benefits of the process in the delivery of State services, including education to the communities involved.</P>

      <P>In addition to the financial assistance available under the grant schemes for further and higher education, students with disabilities attending courses in third level colleges and post leaving certificate centres may apply for assistance from the special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department. The purpose of the special fund is to provide grant assistance to students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance under the special fund are received by my Department at the beginning of the academic year. Completed application forms are normally forwarded to my Department by the disability officer, or the responsible officer of the institution.</P>

Applications for assistance under the special fund will be dealt with expeditiously in order to ensure that awards are made at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case in question.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate has reported on this case. The pupil referred to by the Deputy is currently in fifth class and is in receipt of remedial support until the end of the current school year. The pupil was recently tested by the school in the Drumcondra attainment test and the results indicate an improvement in her ability.</P>
      <P>The tests results were examined by the Department inspector who also consulted with the principal and the remedial teacher attached to the school. The inspector advised the school that the child does not meet the criteria for remedial support as recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>The Department has not decided that no remedial service will be provided to any child in sixth class. The school is free to provide a service to any pupil where it is satisfied that the service is in the best interest of the pupil having regard to the needs of other pupils who might need services.</P>

      <P>Teachers in primary schools are appointed and employed by the managerial authority of the school. In the event that the managerial authority of a primary school is unable to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher at a particular time, it may appoint a person who is not fully trained in a temporary capacity. The managerial authority must continue to make every effort to obtain the services of a fully qualified person including re-advertising a post.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives to assist managerial bodies in recruiting teachers has been introduced by this Government.</P>
      <P>B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C in honours Irish at the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>Primary degree holders who hold the diploma in education but do not have grade C in honours Irish at the leaving certificate, who commence employment after 1 April 2000, are paid at the trained rate for up to 14 weeks.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>In connection with the particular teacher mentioned by the Deputy, I wish to clarify the position as follows.</P>
    <P>Substitute teachers are employed when a teacher is absent on paid sick leave or maternity leave, whereas temporary teachers are employed when a teacher takes unpaid leave of absence.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot make an exception in the case of this teacher and allow her to be employed in a temporary capacity for the duration of the entire period.</P>

      <P>The teacher in question has been employed in a qualified capacity since the 1997-98 school year. Prior to that, she was not qualified as she had not achieved the appropriate qualification in Irish which was a requirement at that time for the purposes of recognition. The service prior to 1997-98 was, therefore, unqualified service and is not reckonable for incremental credit purposes.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of rule 116 of the Rules <Col N="551" /> for National Schools, teachers who wish to be granted study leave to attend a course for the following academic year must submit a completed application form, together with the syllabus of the course in question, to my Department. The sanction of study leave by my Department is subject to a number of conditions including the teacher receiving the prior approval of the board of management of the school in which the teacher is employed. The annual circular that is issued by my Department in relation to study leave also clearly states that it will be necessary for applicants to show that the course for which they are seeking leave of absence is demonstrably relevant to teaching in the primary sector. In this context, therefore, study leave is not an automatic right subject to the teacher receiving prior approval of his-her board of management but rather a facility that is extended to teachers who wish to undertake a course relevant to their teaching in primary schools.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the teacher in question received the approval of her board of management and the appropriate documentation was submitted to my Department. The course that the teacher wished to undertake was a course in school guidance and counselling.</P>
      <P>On examination of the submitted documentation a decision was made within my Department that this particular course is not regarded as relevant for the purposes of study leave under the terms of rule 116. The social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; programme in primary schools is an intrinsic part of the revised primary school programme and all teachers are qualified to implement this programme. However, there is no provision in primary education for the employment of guidance and counselling teachers and, consequently, the relevance of this course to the teacher's employment as a primary teacher was not demonstrated.</P>
      <P>The teacher contacted my Department following a letter of 15 June that informed her of the decision to refuse the study leave. The teacher in question was informed that she could appeal the decision. In doing so she would need to establish why she considers that the course in question would be relevant to her work as a primary school teacher. My Department has just received such an appeal from the teacher in question and it will be given due consideration as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances, the pupils referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for full transport facilities, as sought, as the school in question is outside their catchment area.

      <P>Since 1996 the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance <Col N="553" /> grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the State and in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The value of the grant payable to students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including in Northern Ireland, is the Irish value of the grant converted to the currency of the country in which they were studying. However, prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, and the tuition fee in respect of post-graduate courses, subject to the maximum fee limit, was payable without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 onward are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
      <P>I understand that the student to whom the Deputy refers commenced her under-graduate studies in NUI Galway in the 1994-95 academic year and completed her degree in the 1997-98 academic year. She commenced her post-graduate studies at the University of Ulster, Coleraine, in the 1999-2000 academic year after a break in studies of one year. She was assessed and awarded a full fees and maintenance grant under the terms of the 1999 higher education grants &ndash; HEG &ndash; scheme by Sligo County Council. However, as the student in question was not a mature candidate when she returned to pursue her post-graduate studies, she qualifies to have payments made under the former arrangements, as set out in the 1994 HEG scheme. My Department has requested that this student's grant application be re-assessed by Sligo County Council under the terms of the 1994 scheme and that any additional payments due in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year be made.</P>

      <Quest>the precise timescale for the report of the higher educational authority in respect of the recognition and funding of the third level education outreach services which are currently giving courses under the aegis of Carlow Institute of Technology and University of Maynooth in Kilkenny.</Quest>

      <P>The core programme offered in Kilkenny by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, is the BA degree in local and community studies. This part-time degree programme was approved by the higher education authority in 1996 on a self-financing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outreach centre which is operated in Kilkenny by the Institute of Technology, Carlow is approved annually and will continue to be sub<Col N="555" /> ject to review in the light of policy in relation to outreach centres and having regard to the ongoing review of third level education provision.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of outreach centres, the higher education authority published the report of the technical working group on the review of outreach centres of higher education institutions, which was chaired by Professor Noel Mulcahy, in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I have asked the authority to consider the recommendations in the report and advise me accordingly. As the Deputy will appreciate the role of outreach centres forms part of the wider area of open and distance learning and the higher education authority and Oscail, the national distance education centre, jointly hosted a symposium on the future of open and distance learning in higher education in Ireland in March. I understand that the report on the symposium including the report of the rapporteur is to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Another relevant issue in this regard is the work that the higher education authority has been asked to undertake in the light of the report of the review committee on post secondary education and training places, which was chaired by Dr Dónal de Buitléir. The market research which the authority has been asked to undertake in relation to mature students and the proposals that it will bring forward in relation to the provision of mature student places are of particular relevance in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is already aware, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
      <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to primary schools where there are young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and-or extra funding which reflect the levels of need identified. Within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>
      <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will note the great increase in the number of smaller classes and the reduction in larger classes since 1995-96.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a range of new initiatives were introduced since this Government took office to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools. They include improvements in the staffing schedule for the appointment and retention of teachers. Other initiatives include the allocation of additional posts towards specifically helping the educationally disadvantaged and the introduction of a maximum class size guideline of 29 for schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The staffing schedule for 1999-2000 was now structured to ensure that primary schools operate to a general maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
    <P>The current pupil-teacher ratio at primary level is 20.4 : 1 compared to a PTR of 21.7 in the 1997-98 school year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it is schools located in areas of disadvantage that have the most pressing needs for the service, and it is the children in those schools who are most likely to derive the greatest <Col N="559" /> benefit from the service. It is, therefore, my intention, in line with policy generally within my Department, that the first priority in the deployment of the educational welfare officers will be to meet the needs of students in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that 1,000 additional teaching posts will be provided at second level for the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>With effect from the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial teaching. The actual allocation to an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September. Schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are entitled to an allocation of a full post while schools with enrolments under 600 are entitled to an allocation of 0.5 of a post for remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>All second level schools that are designated as disadvantaged have been invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme and have been given an additional teacher allocation for this purpose.</P>
      <P>At primary level teaching posts arising from the demographic dividend are being retained for the 2000-01 school year. These posts are being used to reduce the threshold for the appointment of administrative principals.</P>
      <P>The retention of the posts has also enabled me to implement improvements in the appointment and retention figures at certain points in the staffing schedule.</P>
      <P>I intend allocating two hundred additional posts next September to primary schools where there are young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and-or extra funding which reflect the levels of need identified. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>
