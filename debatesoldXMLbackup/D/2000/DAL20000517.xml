      <P>On promised legislation, does the Taoiseach agree it is very wrong that a tribunal of inquiry established by this House should be frustrated by people giving incomplete evidence? The sole member should have powers analogous to a judge's powers with regard to contempt of court to deal quickly with any lack of co-operation he perceives. Does the Taoiseach agree it is not satisfactory that such lack of co-operation can only be dealt with by using threats of action which might take years to have any effect? Will the Taoiseach consider strengthening the powers of the sole member?</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree that the court officers Bill or the criminal justice fraud Bill which are soon to be presented to the Dáil should be amended to enhance the powers of the sole member of a tribunal to enable him to deal quickly with matters of this nature rather than be forced to wait and wait for actions that might, as I say, take years to have any effect?</P>

I refer specifically to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill and the Human Rights Commission Bill. Given that the Ulster Unionist Council will meet later this week and that we are in default of meeting our obligations &ndash; it is the second anniversary next Monday of the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; does the Taoiseach intend making a statement outlining where this legislation is and giving an indication as to when this House will meet in full, its legislative obligations under the Agreement?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the most important points in my contribution last night. I welcome the repeal of the legislation. Everybody is agreed <Col N="497" /> that it had passed its sell-by date. It will remove the protection provided to Cement Roadstone. We all accept that such protection is no longer necessary for what is now a very successful company.</P>
      <P>What measures will be taken by the Government to facilitate other companies entering the cement manufacturing market? There have been many claims that the CRH monopoly has been abused and that it kept some smaller companies out of the business. While the Bill will remove the protection given to CRH, all of us must ask if it will still be in such a strong position that it will be difficult for potential investors to enter the market. The Government must examine what can be done to help other companies enter the market and compete with CRH. We all know of some prospective entrants and I wonder what measures will be taken if we find they cannot enter the market because of the dominant position of CRH. A company which already has 80% of the market share should not be allowed increase that share. The Minister should ensure those who wish to enter the market are able to do so.</P>
      <P>Last night I asked the Minister to carefully examine the submission made by the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance which has raised very interesting and serious questions in its submission. It is up to the Minister to examine some of the points made and to investigate their truth or otherwise. At the end of the day we do not want a situation where the repeal of the Cement Acts changes nothing. If that happened, it would be pointless repealing the Acts. Now that the Acts are being repealed we want to ensure others have an opportunity to enter the market and that those who take the risk and are prepared to invest in cement manufacturing have equal opportunity and the help and support they need. At the end of the day we should have a better, more competitive and fairer cement manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on repealing the Acts, but want her to realise that the process does not end with repeal. If things are to change other measures may have to be taken and I trust the Minister will take no board the points made by Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> On its own, repealing the Cement Acts, 1933-1962 &ndash; simply removing the requirement to have a licence to manufacture cement &ndash; does not amount to much. The necessity to have a licence was not, particularly in recent decades, what shaped the cement and quarrying industries. Rather it was shaped by how the licence regime was applied at an earlier time and how the effects of that were allowed accumulate. However, repeal of the Acts allows an important opportunity to debate the extremely important quarrying and concrete manufacturing and supply industry as it operated for almost 70 years, to see what lessons should be learned and what policies should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The granting of a licence to Cement Limited in the 1930s created a private monopoly in the production of cement. When that company was merged with Roadstone in 1969 it created a massive private monopoly which had huge power in cement, quarrying, concrete, black top, explosive and related industries. Since then we have had nothing short of a ruthless policy by the CRH monopoly of bullying of small competitors, sharp practice and unfair trading, driving small operators out of the market. It bought its competitors, usually by pressurising them so they had no option but to sell.</P>
    <P>The exposé broadcast by RTE in 1988, which is still in its files, exposed the ruthless measures in which this major capitalist firm indulged in order to maintain a monopoly and to rake in profits. When spokespersons for CRH appeared on television and admitted that they had gone to Spain to nobble suppliers of cement for small competitors of CRH we saw what had come to pass in regard to the industry in Ireland. Why did one operator have such power? Why was it allowed to get away with its position of power and abuse it relentlessly for such a long time? CRH was like an octopus within the Irish capitalist economy. Its directors were also directors of the biggest banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, and there was an intermeshing of directors with many other companies, industries and powerful institutions. What has emerged from investigations and tribunals over the past few years sheds much light on the cement industry and how it operated. We know now that Mr. Traynor was a chairman&mdash;</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> We know that an illegal bank was run from CRH headquarters, a major multinational company, and that the majority of its directors held illegal Ansbacher accounts. That is an incontrovertible fact and it sheds light on the enormous monopoly power that this company was allowed to wield over the economy. Important captains of industry who were also captains of many other powerful financial and industrial concerns led the company and <Col N="499" /> they acted to protect the privilege, power and effect of this monopoly.</P>
      <P>The other question that arises, which has not been teased out properly in the debate, is the extent of the political patronage which this company enjoyed. Why was it allowed to get away with adopting methods which were quite scandalous and which were publicised on television in 1988? CRH admitted to using such methods. Why was nothing done to curb this monster as it drove small operators, family firms, etc., out of the market or gobbled them up using ruthless methods? Later we will debate a Bill which provides for the banning of financial contributions by corporations to political parties. I would like all the establishment political parties in the House to spell out during that debate&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> A Cheann Comhairle, in fairness, I have not gone further than any other speaker in this House or in the Seanad. Other Members have wandered much further than I on various Bills and motions and have not been called to account.</P>
      <P>We are debating the repeal of the Cement Acts and what should, therefore, replace them. It is time to reflect on why the industry developed the way it did and where it goes from here. That is quite legitimate. It would be appropriate for all political parties to outline publicly the financial contributions, if any, they received from CRH. The company has stated that it gave money to political parties. There has been an outbreak of saintliness among the establishment parties in the past few days about corporate funding. They should declare their interests.</P>
      <P>CRH's position within the cement industry and, perhaps, political patronage explain the scandal whereby it was allowed to acquire Glen Ding quarry in 1991 for £1.25 million, which was a tiny fraction of the value of the quarry and its products. Many observers pointed out that it contained approximately £70 million worth of sand and gravel reserves but it was sold to CRH for £1.25 million without tender or public competition. The Government stubbornly resisted and voted against amendments which I moved in regard to the setting up of tribunals. That scandal involved the misuse of a public property but the Government refused point blank to refer it to the tribunals to get to the bottom of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another scandal was that the price of cement was grossly inflated over much of the period that CRH was in control. The company was not brought to book on it and its position was protected. Answers are also needed in this regard because the effect was that all others sectors of society, for which cement and concrete are such <Col N="500" /> important components in terms of investment and building, paid the price. Ordinary working people pay mortgages over 20 or 30 years and some even have 40 year mortgages because of the unrestrained speculation in the housing market. Part of the cost of the mortgage hanging around their necks results from the excessive price of cement that a private monopoly was allowed to charge, unchallenged by the political establishment. The upshot was that in that time CRH was allowed to build itself into a major multinational company operating in 18 countries, with 37,000 employees at no fewer than 1,100 locations, and become a hugely profitable enterprise. Last year it earned a profit of £563.9 million.</P>
    <P>Given that this position was allowed to exist for decades with the connivance of the political establishment, a number of principles should be adopted. Small operators and family firms in this industry must not continue to be crushed by this giant multinational and repealing the Acts will not change anything unless some other important changes are made. The inability of the Competition Authority to examine this industry is scandalous. I would like the Minister to outline what steps will be taken and resources provided to the authority so that an independent assessment can be carried out in regard to the monopoly in the cement industry. The findings of the assessment should be published. It is believed that the head of the Competition Authority resigned because insufficient resources were provided to examine the industry. We want the Minister to tell the House what will happen in that regard.</P>
    <P>Small firms that pay their workers trade union rates of pay, allow for trade union rights where they are sought, and have proper health and safety conditions, must not be crushed by this monster. I want to hear what the Minister has to say about this matter. Such a massive private monopoly should never have been allowed to operate. Just as the electricity and transport companies were developed as public enterprises, the concrete and quarrying industry should have been developed as a publicly owned enterprise. This major component of the economy should be publicly owned and steered in an entirely different direction with input from the firm's thousands of workers. The board should also include representatives of consumers, those purchasing homes, construction industry workers and the Government. In that way the company would be able to provide a service rather than being a grab-all entity for the benefit of a few major shareholders and directors. Such a move is needed particularly at this time when we are experiencing a housing crisis. Young people on average incomes cannot even contemplate obtaining a mortgage because of the outrageous speculation and profiteering in building land and in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to take on vested interests &ndash; the people who have financed the <Col N="501" /> Fianna Fáil Party for decades &ndash; and challenge the profiteering that has occurred. This morning we heard that inflation is running at 5%, thus wiping out at a stroke the minuscule gains for social welfare recipients in the budget and also wiping out the entire gains contained in the national wage agreement. In the circumstances, we need more from the Government than repetitive statements that sometime in the coming year it will all turn around and everything will be all right. Answers are being sought but the Government is not providing them.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that a small cabal of land developers and builders is being allowed to get away with exactly the same thing that the major quarrying and concrete manufacturer was allowed to get away with for decades. Despite all the pious platitudes of the last few weeks about cleaning up Irish politics, what has changed? In fact, with no illegalities involved, the political establishment refuses to raise a finger and is still totally beholden to the massive private interests in construction and land speculation. If such a powerful company was in public ownership and directed to social concerns, people could have the homes they require at a reasonable cost. We could house all our people as there would be provision for everybody on the housing list. In conjunction with action to stop illegal speculation and control the price of building land, the local authority housing list could be cleared in one or two years. This would also remove the despicable and disgraceful situation where a few opportunist politicians attempt to use the plight of the poor and homeless as a battering ram against a few thousand poor people seeking asylum.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the Government's future policy direction in this area. Unfortunately, we will not see action that will allow social concerns to dominate the construction and quarrying industries because the Government is comprised of two extreme right wing parties. However, the possibility that other cement manufacturers might seek permission to enter the market raises serious questions for the future, particularly with regard to the environment. The Minister should comment on the fact that the removal of the licence will make it easier for others to apply for permission. We do not want to see any weakening of the stringent conditions to protect the environment, including the eco-system, as a result of new cement manufacturing capacity. The Government should state clearly that the most stringent conditions will attach to any new applications so that environmental integrity will be a key factor in determining whether permission is granted.</P>

      <P>There has been a broad welcome for the provisions of the Bill which will repeal the Cement Acts, 1933-1962. I commend you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this important debate which allows Members to set out their concerns arising from the effects of those Acts over the years. It is timely to assess their impact. <Col N="502" /> The original Cement Act achieved for the cement industry, and for the country, much of what was intended back in the 1930s. There is a considerable body of evidence, however, that subsequently the effect of the various Acts was quite negative and that much damage was done. A great deal of disturbing information, both within and outside the public domain, needs to be examined. It would be remiss of us not to air these concerns on the occasion of the repeal of these enactments, and most speakers have done so. Has the information that is in the public domain been acted upon? We are aware that on one occasion the EU took action, but no action of any consequence was taken here on foot of that major investigation, or to investigate further rumours and allegations. The principal reason was that it was not the practice at that time to examine any such concerns in the way that has become fashionable more recently. There is also a suggestion that people did not want such an investigation because they were afraid of the findings. An assessment needs to be undertaken of the extent to which that was a factor in the investigations not taking place.</P>
      <P>As various speakers have mentioned, we currently have tribunals investigating payments to politicians, planning matters and hepatitis C. Shocking stories are emerging from all of them. The seriousness of some of the allegations in the public domain concerning the cement industry warrant thorough examination and action. CRH has a particular corporate culture which clearly did not and could not have existed at the time of the enactment of the first Cement Act in 1933. Its strategic vision as set out more recently is &ldquo;to be an international leader in building products and materials and deliver sustained and superior returns to all our stakeholders&rdquo;. In fairness, it does not say &ldquo;shareholders&rdquo;, although some people may judge that that is what is meant. It has become the fourth largest building materials group in the world and is listed on the Dublin and London stock exchanges. Its marketable capitalisation exceeds £4 billion and it is the second largest company in Ireland, after Elan.</P>
      <P>I have to quote figures from 1997 because they are the ones most readily available to me. As Members of the House will be aware, individual Members simply do not have the resources to obtain the information we need to make the points that need to be made. In 1997, the pre-tax profits were £253 million and of that the Irish market accounted for 11% of the sales revenue but a massive 25% of the trading profit. That is a level of disproportion that sets off alarm bells in my mind. I understand that figures for the years immediately before that, some of which relate to an era when the healthy national economy and the buoyancy in the property market did not exist, are fairly similar, as are more recent ones.</P>

      <P>What factors allowed CRH to take <Col N="503" /> such a disproportionate profit from the Irish market and what effect did it have on the housing market and State investment in infrastructure and roads where materials are clearly an important cost?</P>
      <P>Lest I give the impression that I have nothing good to say about CRH, my experience of the company as an employer suggests the opposite. A number of my constituents work in the cement plant in Limerick and they have no complaints about their terms of employment. Several others work for CRH provinces and consider it a good employer.</P>
      <P>In environmental terms, the Bunratty quarry, which is in an extremely sensitive area, immediately adjoining the folk park, several hotels and shops for the tourism industry, recently won an award for the environmental control that is imposed on that property. It is fair to acknowledge the record of the company in this respect, which is not just a recent reaction to public concerns about the environment, and to acknowledge particularly that even in bad times CRH was a good employer. Unlike many others, I have never heard a complaint about the company as an employer.</P>
      <P>We must examine the effect of the monopoly on cement prices and other building material prices. More importantly, in the context of this debate, we must examine whether the simple repeal of enactments, which is the procedure under way here, has any effect on that. Will we continue to have a substantial proportion of house costs and costs of infrastructural projects under the national plan diverted to enhance the profits of this company? Do we even know where these costs arise and the extent to which this artificially created monopoly is facilitated in achieving this result? It is fair to say also that some or all of these effects may have arisen quite legally. If they continue legally there are serious defects in the law as it stands. Merely repealing this enactment, which refers solely to cement, does not adequately address the problems.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the monopoly continues in operation and contravenes existing laws, why are measures not taken to dismantle it? Is it a lack of resources or a lack of will? Do we require action in relation to this matter similar to the US authorities' initiative against Mr. Bill Gates and Microsoft? Do we need to examine more closely what is happening? Besides taking cheap shots at political parties which happen to be in power for a long time, do we need to examine the cross-over of directors between various banks and CRH? Do we need, as many people suggest, to examine the <i>modus operandi</i> which led to the take-over of family quarries and which appears to have been closely connected to the banks' stranglehold on them and on their finances?</P>

      <P>An industry wide <i>modus operandi</i> exists which needs to be examined closely.</P>
      <P>Some people will say, perhaps with some justification, that the Cement Acts of 1933 and 1962 were not necessary and that the industry would have developed without the kind of protectionism which was built into them, but to contend that would be to misunderstand and underestimate the difficulties which were faced by the State in the 1930s. Any fair assessment would find that there was need for the legislation at that time and perhaps a need for the 1962 legislation which followed it. After that era, perhaps from the 1970s onwards, there may well have been a case for the action which is now taking place.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to argue that the cement certification scheme of the 1980s was warranted by the needs of the industry or the country at that time. Questions arise about that, just as many Deputies have said that there are questions about the transfer or sale of Glen Ding. If the State were to examine all these details, either through one of the existing tribunals or by another means, and if it were established that inappropriate influence caused this action and its effects and that the effects were inimical to the interests of the State, what action could be taken in that regard? What remedies are available? Are there remedies currently available which are not being taken or are remedies required which are not covered in the existing legislation?</P>
      <P>In addition, we have the establishment of the fact that an illegal bank was operated from the head office of CRH. That hardly enhances the image of the company and does not imbue great confidence in those of us who would be generally disposed to defending and protecting the interests of Irish companies in the interest of the country and its citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the repeal of these enactments we need to examine what other obstacles to competition have existed over the past 20 <Col N="505" /> years, and may still exist, and the extent to which they need to be addressed. Could CRH, for example, have blocked competition most effectively without these legislative measures by having its tentacles in several areas and having a range of influence which allowed it to monopolise without this legislation? In relation to one of the questions which comes up frequently, namely, the take-over of Greencore quarries, were there joint directors? Did those directors have any role? If politicians of any party had been duly involved, they would not be able to withstand the questions being raised about this issue. Directors who happened to be in both companies should not be allowed to avoid investigation of their involvement.</P>
    <P>A serious question arises as to the reason a huge company which happened to be in a position to take over various other quarries, mostly family quarries throughout the country, would have chosen for many years, until it was outed, to hide its involvement in these quarries and to effectively deny such involvement. I suggest it is a little unusual for people to hide involvement when the involvement is entirely innocent.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the European action which was taken and the Cembureau agreement which was a strategy against imports and the future of the cement industry in 1983. In that agreement, which involved a huge number of cement manufacturers across Europe, a number of dissuasive measures, as they called it, were proposed. Among them was the placing of administrative obstacles, the imposition of quality standards, the destabilising of the market and dealing with shippers. Ireland is credited with having started these discussions and we need to address the question of why, having had that EU investigation and having had a massive fine imposed on the country, we did not follow up that aspect.</P>
    <P>I come to the question that was posed earlier in relation to the resignation of the competition enforcer. It has been suggested that this happened because he was refused the staff needed to examine the operation of Irish industry, including the dominant position of CRH. If that is the case, it is within the power of the Government to address it and there is no excuse for not doing so. I have already referred to the cross-directorships between banks and CRH and the coincidental takeover of various quarries.</P>
    <P>CRH and the Quinn Group are among five companies found guilty of operating a price-fixing agreement in Northern Ireland between 1985 and 1992. The British restrictive practices court took action against them and made a finding. This country needed to take similar action and it is not too late to do so now. It is clear that this industry operated a system of co-operation throughout Europe which restricted competition on an enormous scale and inflated prices in several areas. It would be remiss of this House to let this opportunity go without examining that and the other issues brought to our attention, for example, the manner in which a mining licence was granted to <Col N="506" /> Dolomite and how charges due to Revenue and other Departments have been pursued, or not pursued, as may be the case. Why can people not obtain information? There is a wide range of issues involved which impact on the economy and the national interest.</P>
    <P>Those who have complained have tended to be the small man. They are similar to those who were infected by blood products and treated carelessly in different areas of Irish life. These people did not have a strong enough voice to present their cases, so they were dismissed on various grounds, sometimes fairly but frequently, as the tribunals are discovering, extremely unfairly. These people may not have the resources but they have a right to have their cases heard. The onus is on this House to ensure that happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which repeals the Cement Acts of 1933 to 1962. There are many theories on why this legislation is being introduced at this time. However, what is important is that the Acts are being repealed. This will have an important impact on our building trade. It is interesting to look at the provisions of the first Act in 1933. The then Minister's private secretary sent a letter to Irish Cement Limited in 1936 informing it that it had been granted a licence and outlining its establishment and how it was to operate. It was set out that a licence would be awarded to only one company which could operate in two plants. Cement imports were banned to allow this company to expand. From the enactment of the 1933 Act it was almost another 30 years before there was a repeal of the ban in 1962. In that intervening 30 year period, Irish Cement Limited operated a monopoly on the supply of cement and controlled almost the entire market.</P>
      <P>The letter from the Minister stated the company could expand if necessary although it was not to make enormous profits on the backs of the people. There were no criteria for these excessive profits or to establish if the price of the product was too high. No such measures were included in the legislation, regulations or subsequent correspondence with the Minister. This company was allowed establish in good faith and on trust. The company grew slowly at first but then gained momentum. It is now a huge private monopoly, known as CRH. Even at this stage, almost 70 years later, Irish Cement produces 80% of the cement used in this country, with a further 15%, approximately, coming from the Quinn Group in Fermanagh while about 5% is imported. This is a remarkable achievement for a company with humble beginnings. This demonstrates how the State gave this company the capacity to become a huge private monopoly in cement, sand and gravel, aggregates, blacktops, etc. It dominated the market until a small amount of competition emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall, when I was relatively young, trying to build a house in the late 1960s. I remember the cement strikes in the 1970s when cement was unavailable. This arose because there was only <Col N="507" /> one licence to provide cement. It was a mistake to grant a licence in such a manner. Deputy Joe Higgins asked an interesting question. At a time when the ESB, CIE and Bord na Móna were established under State control, why did the cement industry not become a State company? It would be an interesting subject for a thesis, to review the literature and debates of the time to discover why a State cement company was not established. How did the cement industry operate in other countries? I do not think the same monopoly applied. One can say Ireland is a relatively small country. However, it was a strange decision to take and it gave control of a vital industry to a small number of people.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that Irish Cement received the licence in 1936 and the Constitution was passed in 1937. Article 45.2.ii states: &ldquo;That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good&rdquo;. Did anyone imagine we would look back at how the cement industry monopoly corresponds with our Constitution? Article 45.2.iii states: &ldquo;That, especially, the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment&rdquo;. This seems to contradict what was established a short time earlier. Why did no one point out that we were not operating within the boundaries of our Constitution and the position should be reviewed?</P>
    <P>We must examine the operation of CRH, its monopoly and its controversial dealings. The purchase of Glen Ding from the State is an example. Many questions arose about how CRH was able to purchase it for £1 million when others were interested in it. It was handed over to one huge company for a small sum without going through a process of competition.</P>
    <P>This company was very powerful. The members of its board were involved in every other sector of commerce. There were members who were also on the boards of the two major banks and directors of other companies; they had their fingers in many pies. This enhanced the situation for them and gave them a greater say in what was happening.</P>
    <P>The Ansbacher bank was operating from within CRH's own company headquarters and it seems that many of the directors of the company were using the Ansbacher accounts illegally. It is no surprise that the published figures for CRH do not indicate the remuneration of the directors. There is a global figure for what they are paid but there is no detail of what each individual is paid. It is time that huge bodies, such as CRH, should be required to set out in detail what they pay their directors. In the Seanad debate, the Tánaiste said that she wanted to move down that road. I hope she will.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how CRH spread its operations throughout the State. Many small fam<Col N="508" /> ily businesses were gobbled up by the monopoly that grew around it, with many of the smaller quarries becoming part of this enormous group. That CRH had taken them over was, in many cases, concealed. That is a disgrace. The company was allowed to control the market, keeping prices for cement and various aggregates artificially high, and thus improved its profit potential. As Deputy Killeen pointed out, in 1997, even though only 11% of that company's trade took place in Ireland, 25% of its profits emanated from here. That fact raises questions.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority has not been able to investigate what went on because it did not have the resources. Why did the competition regulator resign? Was it because he did not have the resources to investigate CRH? I hope the answers to these questions will emerge in time.</P>
    <P>The questions relating to cement, aggregates and quarries are contentious. There is much discussion about opening new quarries and granting planning permission. It should be noted, however, that there is a new generation of people coming into that industry. I recently visited a cement works and quarry in my own area. Having been a regular visitor there years ago, I was amazed to find the measures which had been taken at this plant to ensure environmental protection. A remarkable job had been done to make it aesthetically pleasing &ndash; difficult to do in a cement works. The way in which dust was controlled was extraordinary. There were plants around the quarry and pleasant lakes had been created. A new generation which cares for the environment is now producing these resources. The company involved is run by Shay Murtagh and his family in Raharney, County Westmeath. In the teeth of huge competition from the CRHs of this world, they managed to develop their own plant in the ready mix and aggregate business. They did that by sheer hard work and determination and now they are reaping the rewards. Fair play to them. Many other companies are developing along similar lines and the fact that these people are supplying the materials while looking after the environment and producing materials at reasonable prices will enhance the countryside.</P>
    <P>That is not always the case and not all companies have a clean bill of health. Speakers have referred to the application made by Lagan Cement to open a cement works two miles from Kinnegad on the County Meath border. The company applied for planning permission to open a cement works. There was understandable concern on the part of some of the local people and a local action group was established. Its members were worried about pollution, particularly of the water supply, because many of them used their own wells and, if the plant drilled deeply into the ground, there was a strong possibility that they could lose their water supply. Planning permission, with stringent conditions, was granted by Meath County Council and Westmeath County Council. Those decisions were appealed to An Bord Pleanála and it recently granted permission <Col N="509" /> for this plant to go ahead. Lagan Cement must secure an EPA licence and I hope that when the plant opens, it will be run in an environmentally sensitive manner while providing much needed employment. This is an area with many jobs for women in the catering industry, but very few jobs for men. The 200 jobs this plant will create will be a tremendous boost to the area. I hope the concerns of the action group will be met.</P>
    <P>There was a major blot on the copybook, however. The objecting group was suddenly in a position to take extravagant court cases and to fight Lagan Cement tooth and nail. The case made it to the High Court. It subsequently emerged that a rival company, the Quinn Group, had provided at least £30,000 to this group, funding its campaign and feeding it with money through hidden accounts to keep Lagan Cement out of that area. That is disgraceful. Through the repeal of the Cement Act, the Minister should be able to build in a proviso that in such situations, companies like the Quinn Group could not have behaved in this manner.</P>
    <P>The Quinn Group attempted by way of a High Court injunction to prevent An Bord Pleanála making a decision about the cement factory. Mr. Justice Quirke found that the Quinn Group had engaged in doubtful practices and conduct in relation to an open and lawful application by Lagan Cement for planning permission. A rival company operated that way to keep it out of the market. It is disgraceful that a rival company should behave like that. The judge also said that the Quinn Group made covert payments by way of surreptitious financial contributions to the group to fund its campaign. He noted that some of those payments had been made in assumed names. It is outrageous that a company should behave in that way and be allowed get away with it.</P>
    <P>That company's behaviour delayed the setting up of a company in Kinnegad and its employment of 200 people and it prevented those people getting a weekly wage for a considerable number of months. It prevented that company coming into direct competition with the Quinn Group for the supply of cement. That was the only reason it was in that market and in the business of supplying money, which is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this debate. I welcome the repeal of the Cement Acts. The Minister of State in his capacity in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should examine what we can do to prevent those types of spurious objections that are blatantly made on the basis of competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a curious construction. One must question the necessity to repeal the Cement Acts at this juncture. In so far as it gives us an opportunity to debate global issues pertaining to our cement industry, it is particularly welcome. In light of what has been said by previous speakers and documented evidence on the failure of the Competition Authority in particular to carry out its mandate and it being denied the capacity to do so because of a lack of funding and <Col N="510" /> inadequate staffing levels, I have to conclude that the Bill is merely a fig-leaf to cover up the inactivity of the Minister and the Minister of State in this area.</P>
      <P>Cement is critical to the construction industry. One of the major problems facing our economy is that of home ownership and people not being able to afford to buy their own homes. That problem is tied up with the cement industry. Allegations have been substantiated in the courts about price fixing between the major players in the cement industry here who have been convicted in Northern Ireland, yet the Competition Authority has been unable to carry out its remit. Concern has been expressed about how the industry is currently operating.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum is revealing. It states that the repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, is proposed on the grounds that the industry is operating successfully and that the need for regulation has become redundant with the passage of time. Nothing could be further from the truth. The need for regulation in the industry is more necessary than it ever was. Previous speakers referred to incidents where those who have a dominant share in the market are currently flexing their muscles in every possible way to deny the consumer access to fairly priced concrete products. That has serious consequences for the construction industry generally, in the building of office blocks and houses in particular, if the price of concrete products and cement is artificially inflated because of the stranglehold the main players have in the market. What happened in the Kinnegad scenario with the entry of a new company to the cement industry is evident, if evidence was ever needed, of the cosy comfort that exists in the industry. That begs the question why the Cement Acts are being repealed when a company could enter the market.</P>
      <P>There was an incident some years ago where an application for planning permission in County Mayo was unsuccessful. Although people entered the market, every effort was made to stymie their entry, not legally but through covert funding by one of the main players of local groups who were opposed to the establishment of that plant. That proves, if it was ever doubted, that very comfortable margins are being made by the industry and that the consumer pays a significant price over and above what he or she should pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to CRH and rightly so. It makes a mockery of the consumer's quest to get the best possible price when the extent to which that company owns and controls various seemingly independent operators of concrete products around the country is not known. I and, I am sure, most Members received documentation from the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance. It suggests that over the years CRH, by way of an acquisitions policy or an eviction strategy, has impacted on numerous operators in the industry. I have a list of those operators, and they include Mount Nugent Quarry, Cavan; Barley Hill Quarry; Milverton Quarries, Skerries; Cal<Col N="511" /> laghan Concrete, Trim; Tallaght Block, Dublin; Galmac Wicklow; National Concrete, Dublin; Byrne Concrete, Galway; Harton Concrete, Meath; C&amp;H Quarries, Galway; Tipperary Limestone, Irish Aggregates, Dublin; Tarstone, Wicklow; Charlie Lee, Longford, Wicklow Concrete; Kilkenny Block; Ardfert Quarries, Kerry, Danaghers (Creeves Quarry), Limerick; Joseph Hogan, Limerick; Greencore Quarries; Ryan's of Ennis; Buckley Quarries; Castlemore Quarries; William Ellis; John A. Wood; Maye and Sons, Meath; Galway Readymix; etc. The list is as long as my arm. Consumers are unaware that behind the scenes the financial gurus of CRH pull the strings in those listed companies and fix the price while consumers try to get the most competitive quote for cement and concrete products.</P>
    <P>Under company law the maze of company construction must be laid bare to enable people to identify the beneficial owners or controllers of all industries, not only in the cement industry. Given that many of these companies operate internationally, it is equally important that information should be shared between various competition authorities, particularly within the EU. The OECD, in a recommendation in 1998, made the point that most competition authorities are not currently authorised to share this information. Given that many of these companies operate internationally and, as a previous speaker said, CRH is the third or fourth largest construction company in the world, this information should be shared so that we get a picture across national boundaries as to where the beneficial ownership of companies lie. That would enable more effective policing of the industry and ensure that the consumer gets the best possible price.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect is the stranglehold that that company has on the industrial explosives which are critical to industry. This is another area which an efficient and effective Competition Authority could look at to see what effect that stranglehold is having on all other operators who attempt to maintain their independence and provide the service at a competitive cost to their consumers but who have to go cap in hand, and are price takers in terms of industrial explosives, to CRH. At face value it would appear that should not be allowed to continue and that the company should be forced to divest a percentage of its shareholding in industrial explosives. CRH, in its various guises, and the Quinn Group&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not named any individual and I do not intend to. There is scope for serious concern that there is a stranglehold on the industry between those two groups of companies. This Bill is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover up inaction in areas where serious action is needed. I am talking about a properly staffed and resourced Competition Authority which will be able to investigate that industry. It is interesting to note that the director of competition enforcement, Mr. Patrick Massey, in his letter of resignation to the Tánaiste, said his experience over the past three and a half years had convinced him that price fixing cartels represent a serious problem and are costing consumers millions of pounds. The Bill will not do anything to alleviate that problem.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue under the guise of this Bill we would be better off discussing whether the necessary powers are available to the Competition Authority as constituted and what additional powers it should be given. It is open to the Minister, without amending the Competition Authority legislation, to provide the authority with the necessary financial resources. To expect to run a Competition Authority on approximately £1 million per year is ludicrous. Tribunals in Dublin Castle and elsewhere over the past number of years are costing close on £100 million. At a later stage we could well have to investigate these industries by way of tribunals if the Competition Authority is not given the necessary resources to enable it intervene on behalf of the ordinary citizen who seeks the best possible price when buying these materials.</P>
      <P>I question the purpose of the Bill and I think it is nothing more than a fig leaf for the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Bill which the Labour Party welcomes. It is long overdue. I assume there are few in the House who would be closer to Cement Limited than myself. My grandfather was involved in building the first plant in Drogheda along the River Boyne. Most of my uncles and relatives worked there in one form or another since the company opened in the early 1930s. Credit must be given to the late Frank Aiken who was the prime mover in having that industry set up in Drogheda. At that stage the Department was young and inexperienced. Given that we did not have the expertise in the manufacture of cement and cement products the Government of the day had to encourage foreigners from countries such as Sweden to assist us. Effectively they were very much involved in setting up and financing the company in the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> It is easy to understand the reason it was able to secure a monopoly position under written contract and by law under the Cement Act, 1933. It was in a position to set a hard bargain in order to set up the industry in Ireland, in Drogheda and subsequently in Limerick, for which the Government of the day had to pay a substantial price. No other industry was given that monopoly.</P>
    <P>In the Seán Lemass era all Irish industry was protected very substantially. The main industries in Ireland at that time were the textile, clothing, footwear and leather goods industries, all of which were substantially protected by law. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement these trade barriers were lifted gradually over a period of ten to 15 years. I handled those industries at national level for many years before coming into the House. I know how hard we fought to retain or slow down the level of protection to those industries. I forecast many times that they would be eliminated. Unfortunately that forecast came to pass and there is now little of the clothing, textile and footwear industries left in the country. That is the reason we often quoted the monopoly position of Cement Limited. There were ten clothing factories in Drogheda, five textile mills and four or five footwear companies employing thousands of workers, one of which employed 1,500. They were let go to the wall but mysteriously Cement Limited was able to maintain a monopoly until well into the 1960s when its position was secure and it had amalgamated with Roadstone and strengthened its financial position. Since then it has monopolised the building industry.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting for historians to look at the company and see how that monopoly came about. In my opinion it came about simply because CRH had such political strength nationally that it was able to convince successive Governments to use its influence to maintain what other industries could not maintain, namely, a total monopoly of the market.</P>
    <P>As a small schoolboy I brought a bowl of stew or whatever to my grandfather in the factory &ndash; there was no canteen &ndash; and I stayed on the side of the road. Showers of cement blew down on top of us from the chimneys while he ate his lunch. How he lived to be 80, in the conditions under which he had to work in the old plant, I will never know. People working in that industry suffered many illnesses from inhaling dust and poor working conditions. The pay was not good. Due to the strength of the trade unions &ndash; many of my family were involved in the cement industry &ndash; they were able to win concessions, get better working conditions and set up a health and safety system to examine conditions under which they had to work. Many aspects of the original plant were little better than a concentration camp. Many workers, predominantly men, died prematurely from chest problems such as asthma and other lung diseases. Cases are only beginning to emerge now as a result of deaths which took place in the early <Col N="514" /> years of cement production and in cement related industries.</P>
    <P>However, equally, Irish Cement Limited played a major part in the economy of my town and also the country. The employment provided in Drogheda not only by Irish Cement Limited, but its subsidiary, Premier Periclase, is substantial. The wages and conditions there improved substantially when the new plant opened in Platin on the south side of Drogheda because environmental and health laws had been updated. I have experience of both plants over 50 years and the improvement is obvious. However, it did not happen without a terrible price being paid and a dreadful struggle by the workforce, which was led by trade unions. The cement sector is probably the most difficult from an industrial relations point of view. Nevertheless, we stuck with it and, ultimately, it was worth the struggle. Perhaps the Minister could shed some light on how it was possible for that privileged position to be maintained for such a long period.</P>
    <P>This matter may not be the Minister's responsibility but that of the local authority or the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is important that the highest standards of environmental protection are applied to this industry. I am aware from first hand experience &ndash; I used to shoot rabbits in the quarry when I was young &ndash; of the damage that it can cause to the environment. There are three huge quarries on the north side of Drogheda which could probably take all the refuse from Dublin city for the next 100 years without it being seen. I am not sure if people are aware of the depth and width of those quarries. Drogheda Corporation has used a small portion of them as a dump for the past 25 or 30 years, but one cannot notice the refuse given the overall size of the quarries. The industry leaves its mark on the environment and this aspect must be considered.</P>
    <P>It also creates major problems for communities and towns such as Drogheda where the roads were not designed for the type of transport which enters and leaves a cement factory. If one looks at the Ashbourne road travelling in the direction of Dublin, one will notice that the carriageway on the left side is always in a worse condition than the right side of the road. The is because of the huge number of bulk tankers which leave the Platin cement works full and come back empty. I have been driving to and from Dublin for over 30 years and the damage caused to one side of the road is evident, particularly in the winter when there is wet weather. The tankers destroy the roads.</P>
    <P>Such industries should have to pay not only the tax on their vehicles, but also a form of premium towards the upkeep of the roads to the local authorities in whose areas they operate, in this case Louth County Council, Meath County Council and Drogheda Corporation. It has been necessary to spend huge amounts of money in Drogheda on repairing roads from the old works along the River Boyne because all the traffic had to come <Col N="515" /> through the middle of the town. This and the Premier Periclase operation caused traffic congestion. They should have to make a special payment towards the upkeep of the roads because of the damage caused. I do not suggest they are responsible for all the damage to the roads, but they play a major role.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the health and safety aspects of industries which pollute the atmosphere. No matter how much Drogheda Corporation or Louth County Council tried to convince the company to reduce the level of emissions of dust from the plants over many years, it was almost impossible to nullify. The technology to achieve that has not yet been invented. Many people have had to live under the shadow of the company. When the wind blew from the east, one could be sure that one's car would be white the next morning. All the windows in the house had to be closed or one would be in serious trouble in terms of household contents, doors and other items.</P>
    <P>This is the price one must pay to live in an industrial environment. My town and county is an industrial area and we have much for which we are thankful in that regard. We are grateful because many other industries and services built up around the cement companies and they depend on those companies for their livelihoods. I do not underestimate the importance of that aspect.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how it is possible to justify the operation of the monopoly. I often thought it was because it was paying a price to political parties, as Deputy Higgins said earlier. However, I and my colleagues from other parties and independents in my area are aware that Irish Cement Limited in Drogheda has a strict policy of not making any contributions to any party or individual. I am not aware of what it does, or did, nationally &ndash; I am not privileged with that information. However, that is and has been the position since Irish Cement Limited in Drogheda was founded, although it was founded and supported extensively by the then Fianna Fáil Administration. We have much for which we should be grateful.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill but it must be considered in a wider context. CRH obviously is not worried about it because I did not receive any correspondence from its workers or the company itself stating that they disagreed with the legislation. They consider it harmless legislation which will remove a historical provision, but which will not change the monopoly position of Cement Roadstone in our lifetime. I welcome the Bill but I am interested in the Minister's reply. Perhaps he could explain how thousands of jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries were lost when hundreds of companies closed down because trade restrictions were lifted in agreement with Britain or the EU, yet that monopoly was allowed to continue. If the Minister could answer that question, he would play a major role in estab<Col N="516" /> lishing more of the history of Drogheda than has already been written.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and the principle of what the Government is doing. There is a need to address the licensing aspect of cement production in Ireland. I was reared in a builders' providers business. My family has been involved in that business since the early 1920s and I have seen the increase in production in the building industry in recent years.</P>
      <P>When I heard the Bill was to be introduced, I was reminded that, when I was in secondary school, the only company from which one could buy cement was Cement Roadstone. We are located close to Northern Ireland where there was a cement manufacturing industry called Blue Circle Cement from which one could buy cement. I do not remember what price it charged but it was cheaper for us to import the cement from Northern Ireland and sell it. That created a difficulty because, at the time, the Department of the Environment, as it was then, gave a great deal of grant aid towards house building, but not if one did not use Irish cement. The monopoly of Cement Roadstone on the building industry was phenomenal. I agree with part of what Deputy Bell said. I understand the motivation behind the monopoly and why it was allowed to develop, which was that we needed to be able to manufacture cement in Ireland. Nonetheless, I do not understand how it was allowed to continue for so long under many Governments.</P>
      <P>Cement Roadstone still controls a huge aspect of the building industry, especially if one takes into account quarries and industrial explosives. Its tentacles reach into many businesses throughout the country and it is still in an extremely strong position. I know it has moved on internationally and is one of our flagship companies. However, we as legislators must bear in mind that competition is good. In the context of the discussion, I cannot help but digress to point to another difficulty with below-cost selling and RGDATA. We all support the latter's position of trying to keep small family-run businesses. In the cement industry, we oppose monopolies. As legislators, we have difficult decisions to make and sometimes, while there is a logic, there is not a consistency to what we seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the cement industry, I live close to the Quinn Group which erected a cement manufacturing facility in County Fermanagh less than a mile from the Border. It decided it would challenge Cement Roadstone's monopoly, something it did successfully. However, it could only do so from Northern Ireland because our legislation meant it could not build a plant in the South to take on Cement Roadstone. Fortunately that has changed and a modern plant is now being built by the Quinn Group in the South which should mean it can provide a greater amount of cement. I was glad to see planning permission being given <Col N="517" /> by An Bord Pleanála for the erection of another cement plant in Enfield.</P>
    <P>The way the building industry is going, the more competition there is, the better. As a practitioner in that industry in the sense that my family business is in this area, I have found it amazing that, since competition arrived with the Quinn Group ten years ago, the price of a bag of cement has stayed relatively static. I asked my brother about this and it appears that we have been selling a bag of cement at £4.60 for the past six years. The increase in prices of any other material in the business has been phenomenal. I have no doubt that this relatively static price is because of competition.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very important and, in principle, I support what the Government proposes. However, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Creed, that we must also examine other aspects of the industry. Merely removing the licence will not resolve the problem. The Competition Authority will have a significant role to play. For example, as regards industrial explosives and quarrying, one cannot continue in business if one is not allowed to use industrial explosives, and Cement Roadstone controls that sector. There are many small quarries throughout the country which are in competition with the quarries of Cement Roadstone, and I presume they encounter difficulties when it comes to obtaining industrial explosives.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy Bell had to say about bulk tankers leaving the cement factory in Drogheda and the damage they caused to roads. We had a situation in County Leitrim last week where a quarry, which had been closed for 30 years, was bought by an individual originally from the area who emigrated to England, was successful in the quarrying business and decided to re-open the quarry in Kesh, County Leitrim. His only access was through a county road. He employed 15 people and was up and running for about six months. While he had received planning permission, one of the aspects of the permission was that he had to pay £350,000 up front for work to be carried out on the county road and £25,000 a year thereafter. He decided that that could not be sustained economically and closed the quarry. There are difficulties and they are more the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government than the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. From what I can ascertain from other people in the quarrying industry, many local authorities require quarrying companies to pay a certain amount to compensate for damage to roads. There must be a happy medium. The 15 job losses in Kesh were a huge blow to the area and they were caused by the amount of money sought by the local authority. The quarry operator has appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála, so it will be an interesting test case.</P>
    <P>If competition is to be sustained in the building industry, and it will be necessary over the next few years, we should examine the number of busi<Col N="518" /> nesses in this sector of the industry in which Cement Roadstone is involved. I do not suggest it is the big bad wolf. It has done a great deal of good for the development of the industry. However, now that we are an open market economy which is fully up and running, its monopoly in all sectors should be examined, and we should also examine whether the price charged to consumers is necessary and whether both price and service are the most competitive available to consumers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The principle of it is correct. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Creed, about the competition aspect, and perhaps the Minister of State will examine it. The Competition Authority should be given more personnel so that it can investigate areas such as the one we are discussing. There have been many complaints about this industry. A number of people contacted me in recent years, even when my party was in Government, regarding unfair practices in the cement and quarrying industries because of the monopoly. That is a major issue and, while the Bill will certainly not resolve it, it may be the first step towards a resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to repeal the 1933 and 1962 legislation which was never intended to create the monopoly that has developed. The intention was to create an indigenous industry which was important at a time when the newly created State was beginning to develop. Raw materials which were available throughout the country were a necessary part and parcel of that development. Alas, when one looks at what has happened in the cement industry since the granting of the first licence and, in more recent years, the buy over by CRH in various places &ndash; Cavan, Skerries, Duleek, Trim, Meath, Wicklow, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Ennis &ndash; one will see the industry is in the control of one group. That is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority recently expressed its concern. Ireland's competition enforcement chief resigned because he was refused the resources necessary to combat the secret price fixing in the construction industry in particular. That is a terrible indictment. That person had a particular job to do but was stifled through lack of resources.</P>
      <P>He stated in a letter: </P>
      <P>My experience over the past three and a half years has convinced me that price fixing cartels represent a serious widespread problem in this country and are potentially costing Irish consumers and taxpayers tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>The building industry was highlighted as the area in which this cartel was operating to the greatest extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the activity in Galway where, according to the national development plan, there will be huge investment in infrastructure. The necessity for roadbuilding <Col N="519" /> materials has led to a rash of planning applications for new quarries and building materials all over County Galway. That has created a major problem for the local planning authority.</P>
    <P>As regards the planning Bill and the position with regard to pre-1963, many of those involved in the quarrying industry, with few exceptions, are not complying with the conditions attached to the planning permissions. We have visual evidence of this. As for those post-1963, they have run rampant and are out of control. They have no regard or respect, and I do not say this lightly, for residents in an area or any activity adjacent to or near their operations. Is it right that they ignore all the conditions imposed on them by the planning permissions? They blast without warning those living nearby. They operate, and by its nature quarrying is a noisy industry, from the very early hours until late at night particularly during the summer. They will not take the smallest remedial measures to control the amount of dust generated. Deputy Bell referred to this problem earlier. They will not cover the material they break out. It blows off the trucks which are overloaded. There is no way in which any local authority can use enforcement measures to get them to change their ways. Local authorities are highly dependent on most of these companies to supply material and they will not tell them to clean up their act. If people suggest something should be done they are asked if they would like to see an increase in the price to the consumer. They have people over a barrel and utilise that stick to beat them at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not blame county councils for not taking enforcement proceedings against them. They do not have sufficient resources. Many Deputies have said time and again that local authorities are overburdened and have requested the Department to sanction the appointment of additional planners and other staff in an effort to alleviate the delays in planning. People want to get on with their developments and that is good. We do not have sufficient enforcement officers to ensure the planning conditions laid down by the professionals are properly implemented. This is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>As regards the supply of gravel and roadmaking materials, there is indiscriminate destruction of the landscape. We are now at a stage where some developers or those involved in that aspect of the building trade who see an esker offer the landowner a price he or she cannot refuse. The morale of the farming community is at a very low ebb and when such an offer is made they will be conscious that it may not happen again and so they sell the land. The sand is removed indiscriminately.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the wildlife Bill I highlighted what is happening in many areas. The old chestnut of importing sand and what that would do to house prices was raised. The average construction price of a house is £30 per square foot, with small variations in price from one place to <Col N="520" /> another. If that is the case, the average house, at 2,000 square feet, would cost £60,000. How does the end product cost between £100,000 and £150,000? Where is the discrepancy and who is creaming it off? The answer is plain &ndash; the developers and those in the supply area have taken substantial and unjustified profits. They have put houses beyond the reach of many young people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot control truck weights. Could any local authority bring an overloaded truck to a functioning weighbridge? It would take half a day to mobilise the requirements in order to prove to these people that they are breaking the law. A huge operation would be involved because of the inadequate operation of weighbridges in most local authorities &ndash; I speak as a member of Galway County Council. There is a weighbridge in Carnmore and I do not know the last time a truck was weighed there. From my observation, the facility looks overgrown and semi-derelict. These trucks can carry 25 or 30 tons of material. Before these trucks leave quarries they are supposed to be washed down and cleaned, but one can tell where a sand or concrete quarry is from three or four miles away because of the dust on the vegetation and the roads around it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the monopoly, small family-owned quarries in Galway have been bought out in the past 12 months and changed into big operations because of proposed by-passes in the west, the new N6 and other major roadworks. We are not complaining about that, but smaller operations which supplied local needs are being wiped out, as happened in the hoovering exercise that has brought the industry under the control of a monopoly over the years. I welcome the legislation in so far as it will free up competition and allow control of pricing to pass out of the hands of the monopoly. It may reactivate interest among local authorities and enforcement officers in looking into this area, as when one mentions dirty industry in Ireland one is not talking about heavy industries in the ports, one is talking about the quarries &ndash; the gravel and cement industries. They are what I call dirty industries. This is an indigenous industry and I hope we can hold onto it, but it is regrettable that it is a monopoly that is flouting the law with price fixing and cartels. Much of that has occurred during our greatest period of development, but it is now opportune that this Bill regulates the area so that does not continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that this Bill is a short repeal measure consisting of two sections. Deputies have ranged widely in their comments from the economic circumstances which prompted the original Cement Acts, the recent history of the industry, environmental concerns, the current difficulties in the housing market, the operation of Cement Roadstone Holdings and its relationship with other players.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Deputies Perry, Gormley, Rabbitte, Ahearn, Higgins, McGrath, Creed, Bell, Killeen, Reynolds and Ulick Burke raised different issues and I thank them for their contributions. Those issues concern the activities of CRH as the sole licensee, among others, and while breaches of company law are not relevant to the content of the Bill, I assure the House that the Tánaiste has undertaken to look into certain allegations made in the Seanad debate on this measure and inquiries are still being pursued in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies commented on the possibility of the abuse of a dominant position arising out of the fact that only one company held the licence under the Cement Acts. I am aware that certain allegations of anti-competitive behaviour referred to by several Deputies have been the subject of a detailed submission by the Quarry and Concrete Family Alliance. That submission has been brought to the attention of the Competition Authority. I do not intend to deal with the range of issues in that submission other than to say that the association involved has welcomed this legislation. Some of those issues are the subject of an action brought by one of the alliance's members in the High Court. Deputies may agree that examples of practices in this industry which fall short of the norms of good business practice do not appear to be confined to any single player.</P>
    <P>In response to the queries raised by some Deputies, I understand that the licence applications from possible entrants to the market were rejected on at least two occasions in the past. The reasons were that the production capacity of Irish Cement, the then licensee, already exceeded domestic demand. The licence application by a separate company, Roadstone, was under consideration in the late 1960s. In the event, Roadstone and Cement Limited subsequently merged. Deputy Rabbitte queried the reasons I referred at the outset to the legislation having been unused over the past 20 years. Deputy Owen even queried the origin and justification for this repeal measure and Deputy Gormley wrongly assumed that the repeal was at the insistence of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation can be described as unused because it is over 20 years since an application for a licence was made to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or its predecessor, the Department of Industry and Commerce. While there have been inquiries from time to time about obtaining a manufacturing licence, none ever reached the stage where a licence was to be either granted or refused. I understand the repeal of this legislation has been under consideration since the early 1970s, although the matter was not pursued by any previous Government. It would appear that Deputies Rabbitte and Owen want to identify themselves with Saint Augustine on this issue; they are all for the virtues of regulatory reform, but not just yet. They query the necessity to pursue this measure at this time. The industry thinks otherwise and so do those interested in promoting greater competitiveness <Col N="522" /> in the national economy. They see no reason for deferring change or leaving matters on the long finger, as Deputies Rabbitte and Owen seem to want. In this context&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said there was a dubious or invisible reason the Bill has been unearthed at this time. The doubt was created by a couple of comments, including those by the Deputy, and I am responding. There is no difficulty whatever about the Bill. We have decided to proceed with the Bill which has been welcomed by large and small producers in the building materials industry, including the quarry and cement alliance, in the context of the Government's programme of regulatory reform.</P>
      <P>The competitions and mergers review group which recently reported to the Tánaiste with recommendations on the effectiveness of competition legislation welcomed the more positive attitude adopted by the Government to the relaxation of controls, restrictions, licences and other limitations which served to control entry to particular economic sectors. The group made a specific reference to the Government's intention to repeal the Cement Acts as a welcome step in this direction. As Deputies mentioned, the construction sector is currently booming on an unprecedented scale.</P>
      <P>Steps to avoid overheating through measures to expand capacity on the supply side and to meet the demands of infrastructural requirements and house building targets in the national development plan are evident in the development of increased manufacturing capacity, not only by CRH but in the entry to the market of other private investors such as the Quinn Group development in Ballyconnell, County Cavan, and the Lagan Group plans for Clonard, County Meath. The arrival of these new entrants to the market illustrates the extent to which market conditions have changed from those prevailing in our economy throughout the last century or longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies repeated assertions made elsewhere which are erroneous and damaging. In particular I take issue with assertions made by Deputies Perry and Gormley to the effect that the cement certification scheme introduced in the 1980s is in breach of the Treaty of Rome. The certification scheme was introduced in the 1980s based on an earlier standard of the Institute of Industrial Research. It is open to all applicants who meet the standard and only one application has been refused, that refusal being on a purely technical basis. The list of companies <Col N="523" /> which has been certified under the scheme includes companies from Spain and the UK. This is an example of where we have set standards ahead of our European counterparts and we should not diminish the significance of that achievement. The certification and technical standards operated in Ireland are world class and are being modelled not only in Europe but in the United States.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Perry's view that greater transparency regarding the material and other costs in the housing industry is desirable. I understand that the KPMG study, referred to by Deputy Owen, is expected to confirm that cement is not rising in price as fast as inflation and that cement prices have remained relatively stable compared to other factors contributing to the high cost of housing. I am not aware, however, that a regular benchmarking procedure is used to track comparable cost factors in the industry and I will take up the concerns raised by Deputies Perry, Rabbitte, Owen and Killeen in this regard with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of specific issues to which I would like to refer individually in so far as I can recollect them. A number of Deputies spoke about the effective control of industrial explosives by CRH. The control of explosives is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is subject to the law and regulations laid down by that Department. CRH does not manufacture explosives but has an interest in the current sole manufacturer. New entrants to this market will reduce dependence on a single supplier. Of course our economy always welcomes new entrants to all areas of commercial activity which create competition and consumer choice and which ensure the economy can grow and develop. This is the hallmark of the modern economy.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Glen Ding by a number of speakers. This matter is being aired before the Moriarty tribunal and we must await its conclusions.</P>
    <P>Queries were raised about the dominance of CRH in the supply of dolomite. Dolomite is classified as a scheduled mineral and a licence is required from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for its extraction. Currently there is only one licence holder, namely, Roadstone Provinces Limited, while other companies are in negotiation with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. It is categorically wrong to say that these operators have been faced with massive royalty demands.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to CRH's agreement with the ESB regarding the purchase of pulverised fuel ash, the takeover of the sugar company quarries and its dominant role in the fertiliser industry. Each of these issues was covered in a submission by the quarry and concrete alliance and we have referred the submission to the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>Reference was also made to secret acquisitions by CRH. These and related issues are currently being examined by the company law section of our Department. We are very proud of our company law division, one of the primary agents of State service which has done outstanding work in the company law area over the past number of years, particularly with the investment which has been made in information technology. Deputies can be certain that when the investigation has concluded the necessary action will be recommended by them.</P>
      <P>A number of other questions were raised. Deputy McGrath talked about the rationale of establishing a licensing system in the 1930s which safeguarded just one company. We did not have a cement industry in the 1930s and the Fianna Fáil Government of the time decided it was necessary to stimulate economic activity. I pay special tribute to Deputy Bell's very positive contribution to the debate which put the issue in context. Nobody had the resources or technical ability to deliver this product which was vital in terms of providing a base for economic activity. Fianna Fáil, the party in Government at the time, decided something had to be done. With international support the original Cement Act was passed allowing a company to set up. It included a caveat that no cement could be imported so that the investment in the project would be viable and sustainable. The objective was to ensure the taxpayer did not have to unpin the enterprise, given that the country had virtually zero growth at that time and huge levels of emigration and economic depravity. Perhaps it is our fault, or that of our predecessors, that we did not examine this and see whether it should have been modernised. However, we are now modernising the industry and for some reason we are being blamed for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean economic deprivation or depravity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant economic deprivation. The legislation did not establish a monopoly &ndash; that was never the intention &ndash; although it probably facilitated the concentration of activity in this area. As the economy evolved, competition grew, companies amalgamated and a dominant player emerged. As a public representative with a business and agricultural background I must say it is <Col N="525" /> a serious situation if a company can quietly buy control in local indigenous operations unknown to the public and the State. We must examine company and competition law to ensure there are no cartels and that consumers get value for money. Against that background, the cement and cement products industry has made a huge contribution to the development of the country. Without it we would not have the type of country we now have. It is very hard to judge future progress while it is easy to judge in hindsight, and the Cement Acts were essential to ensure we had a native production base.</P>

      <P>Deputy Creed said it is wrong to say the Cement Acts regulations are redundant and that regulation was more necessary than ever. He said the Bill was a curious construction. There is nothing curious about it. Competition is central to the evolution of any economy and the planning Acts, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Competition Act, 1991, must be taken into account. They were all enacted after the Cement Acts. Deputy Higgins lambasted the Governments and politicians who did nothing but he must understand that the Competition Bill was not enacted until 1991. Competition evolved in its own way and has found its own level. We are very much working within the framework of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I am proud to be a member of Fianna Fáil and hope to be for a long time. Deputy McGrath provided a detailed analysis of developments along the Westmeath/Meath border. As politicians, we want competition and projects. The public wants competition and consumer choice but when planning applications are made, people do not want projects located near them. A balance must be struck. As politicians, we must be strong enough to do what is in the common good and make serious decisions. That is why we are elected and sometimes one pays a serious price.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed referred to the link between the price of cement and the problem of home ownership. That link is a contributory factor but it is not an impediment to home ownership. The cost of the site, services, construction and materials, such as cement, must be taken into account. The average cost of cement and concrete products in the construction of new homes is less then £10,000. If that is compared to the cost of houses, nobody can say that cement products are an impediment to home ownership. It must be recognised that such products make a huge contribution. They are needed to construct the right type of housing and the quality of housing in Ireland is on a par with that anywhere else in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Bell and Burke referred to the cost of maintaining roads damaged by constant use of construction vehicles. Local authorities impose large service charges on construction companies but that also has a negative effect. Deputy Reynolds referred to a company which closed in his constituency. I am aware of another project which was sanctioned but the company involved said it was not viable to proceed given the charges imposed. There needs to be a consensus between the industry, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and local authorities whereby an annual contribution could be paid by construction companies to take account of the <Col N="527" /> movement of goods and services rapidly throughout the country, which damages the roads structure. That could be examined. The Irish Concrete Federation states that the value of products used in a house worth £200,000 is between £5,000 and £10,000. We can be happy that such products make a huge contribution to Ireland's development.</P>
    <P>The Government and the social partners are jointly committed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to ensuring an efficient and competitive construction sector in order to ensure the cost effective delivery of the infrastructural requirements set out in the national development plan. Deputy Owen expressed concern about how the manpower and training needs of the construction industry are being addressed. All these issues, including the option of the recruitment of additional workers, access for adults to craft occupation and the timely provision of apprenticeship training are being addressed in a strategic manner under the PPF in full consultation with industry and trade union interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Are education and training places available for apprentices? That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Training places are available in co-operation with FÁS and the industry itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are being accelerated in this area.</P>
      <P>I reassure Deputies Ahern and Gormley about the wide range of planning and protective measures which have come into being since the Cement Bills were enacted. All planning applications for new or expanded cement production facilities require planning permission and environmental impact assessments before development can proceed and an integrated pollution control licence must be obtained before production can begin. These provisions apply to all cement production facilities regardless of size or proposed location.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Gormley's concerns about the cumulative effect of new manufacturing facilities on emissions of COf8&gt;2. Other Members also referred to this in the context of the total greenhouse gas emissions limit negotiated by the Government as part of the European Union's plans to implement the Kyoto Protocol. A national greenhouse gas abatement strategy is being prepared by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to enable Ireland to implement its international obligations and it will apply equitably across all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to questions raised by Deputy Owen, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Competition Authority has adequate resources to do its job. Within a month the authority will have five full-time member directors supported by at least 15 staff. Deputy Burke <Col N="528" /> stated that Mr. Massey retired because he did not have resources to investigate whether there is a cartel in the construction industry but that is not true. Mr. Massey resigned from one position. He is still a member of the authority but he resigned his position as director of enforcement because he said he did not have resources to investigate cartels. He did not specify in which industry but it has been inferred by a number of Members that he retired because he did not have the resources to investigate the construction industry It is important that the House is clear on that.</P>
    <P>In addition, steps are being taken by the Civil Service Commission to fill vacancies for professional staff. The Competition Authority has in anticipation of the recruitment of professional staff already employed a legal adviser on a temporary basis. The Tánaiste has arranged for a detailed examination to establish the appropriate resources for the authority. At the end of the day the Government will provide whatever resources are required for the effective operation of the authority. I endorse the view of the National Competitiveness Council that we need to be more pro-active in identifying areas where regulatory reform is needed rather than responding to external pressures at EU level. Our competitiveness, as an economy, depends on the operation of open, transparent and effective markets which encourage efficiency in both price and service innovation.</P>
    <P>Cement prices in Ireland are reckoned to be the fifth highest in Europe, notwithstanding limited competition from imports. Prices are usually higher than they otherwise might be in markets which are not entirely open and where operators have been sheltered. The repeal of the Cement Acts will mark an achievement in Ireland's competitiveness standing and will help it to maintain its high ranking for measures in international competitiveness. It is a sensible step in terms of regulatory reform. That it proves difficult to find time within the legislative process to address the need to repeal or simplify existing measures, highlights the necessity to examine more carefully the prospects for incorporating some set clauses specifying an abolition date within any new licensing arrangements or regulations in future. All Members could give due consideration to that when legislation is debated.</P>
    <P>The removal of the regulatory barriers which these Acts represent is long overdue. Unfortunately, laws and regulations tend to have a long life, even when the scenario for which they were conceived has long since changed. I thank all Members for their contributions.</P>

      <P>The first I heard about the proposal to take all Stages was on the monitor at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour Party a couple of minutes ago. I have no fundamental or substantial objection, but it is a bad precedent that the Minister should proceed without request or notice. If the Minister had made contact in advance with Deputy Owen and myself, we may well have facilitated him, but it is bad practice. The Bill should go into committee in the normal way.

Yesterday something similar happened with the Bill taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, but on that occasion both spokespersons were asked if they would agree and they did. I was in the Whips' office when that matter arose. The first I heard of the proposal to take Committee Stage of this Bill today, however, was when the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said he would take it now.

    <P>I resubmitted this amendment following Committee Stage. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would look at this matter again before Report Stage with the possibility of tabling an amendment on behalf of the Government. The Government has not tabled an amendment so I assume the Minister has not found it possible to accede to the proposal I made on Committee Stage which was to include General Assembly Resolution 47/111 of 16 December 1992 in the Bill because it is a General Assembly resolution which was passed subsequent to the original proposals of the convention we are now proposing to ratify. It would seem logical, therefore, to include it in the text of this legislation which will become law here. I would like the Minister to explain the reason he was not able to bring forward an amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of whether General Assembly Resolution 47/111 of 16 December 1992 should form part of the convention to be included in the Schedule to the Bill. The main effect of the resolution would be to provide funding for the committee established by Article 17 directly by the United Nations instead of through contributions by state parties to the convention. This matter is complicated because although the resolution predated our signature to the convention, it has still not come into effect and indeed it may be some time, if ever, before the amendment is accepted by the number of states required before it can enter into force.</P>
      <P>The advice to me had been that it would not be appropriate, therefore, to include the resolution in the Schedule. Prompted by Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, however, I asked my officials to re-examine this matter in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the Office of the Attorney General, and I undertook to table an amendment on Report Stage to include the resolution in the Schedule if the advice to me was that it was legally appropriate to do so.</P>
      <P>I have had this matter re-examined since Committee Stage and I have been reassured that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to include the resolution in the Schedule. The resolution still has not come into effect and indeed it may be some time, if ever, before it does so. Not including the resolution in the Schedule would have no legal consequence for our ability to apply its terms at some future date if and when it becomes effective, whereas including it in the Schedule would, I am told, be totally inappropriate for a resolution which has not come into effect.</P>
      <P>I regret that in the circumstances I cannot accept the Deputy's proposal but I assure the House that I am acting on technical legal advice in not doing so.</P>

      <P>At the end of Committee Stage debate the Minister suggested that he would come back to us in relation to the matter Deputy Higgins and I raised by way of amendment. It concerns the question of torture and what is lawful in some countries and not in others. We had some debate on practices which we would consider to be entirely abhorrent but which may be lawful in some states. We wanted to make sure that this legislation goes as far as possible in terms of ensuring that the State can take every action possible with regard to such abhorrent acts and that, in this regard, we would push the boat out as far as possible in relation to the convention. After a fairly lengthy debate on Committee Stage the Minister said he would consider coming back to us on Report Stage to see whether anything further could be done.</P>
      <P>I raised the question of the way other countries may have dealt with this issue and whether other countries had been able to find a way around adapting the legislation to domestic law.

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I would like to join Deputy O'Sullivan in expressing concern on this <Col N="535" /> particular aspect of the Bill. This is a good Bill. We support the thrust of what it purports to do and we want to see it enacted as quickly as possible. The Bill contains a definition of torture with which we all agree. It states that torture means an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, is inflicted intentionally on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person or another person information or a confession, punishing that person for an act which the person concerned or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or imtimidating or coercing that person or a third person, or for any reason based on any form of discrimination. The definition provides that it does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions.</P>
      <P>That is the net point we are making. There is obviously an exclusion clause here by virtue of the fact that certain sanctions that are manifestly brutal by their very nature are lawful in other countries, such as mutilations and amputations of a hand or a finger. They are lawful sanctions, particularly in many of the Islamic countries. The sanctions are imposed by court order and are duly executed.</P>
      <P>We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage and the Minister replied that it was a matter for the courts to decide and that this House does not have an obligation, or indeed a right, to legislate for other jurisdictions. We have a right to legislate for our own jurisdiction and it is our job as the elected Parliament, the law making body, to ensure that we set down clear definitions in relation to what are lawful sanctions. These are universally accepted by virtue of the definition in the Bill and we are seeking to ensure the definition we are embracing by virtue of this legislation and endorsed in the convention is rigidly adhered to and that there is no exclusion clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed in detail on Committee Stage and I believe I indicated to the committee at that point that even after in-depth consideration I could not offer any solace to Opposition Deputies in respect of these amendments. I have again considered the excellent and well-intentioned contributions of the committee but I remain of the view that my approach is the best one and I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are seeking to ensure that the defence of lawful sanction will not be available in relation to acts carried out which are contrary to established tenets of international or Irish law. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the same understandable concern was considered by the drafters of the convention. They recognised this exception might be interpreted so as to allow a state to practise methods which would normally be regarded as torture by making them lawful sanctions under its own legal system. On the <Col N="536" /> other hand, however, they were faced with the situation that while the convention was intended to strengthen the prohibition on torture in international law, it was not intended to lead to a reform of the system of penal sanctions in different states and if that had been the intention, the convention would have been unacceptable to a number of countries. The drafters decided to leave open the definition of lawful sanctions in the knowledge that it would be left to the courts to decide in any given case what was lawful and what was not, having regard, as appropriate, to international law.</P>
    <P>My approach to incorporating the convention into Irish law generally has been to follow the wording and approach of the convention as closely as possible which is what I have done in this case. My approach leaves it open to the courts to determine whether what is presented as lawful is genuinely lawful. In such circumstances, a court can, for example, reject a defence put forward by a brutal regime of dubious lawfulness. On Committee Stage I was asked whether other jurisdictions have found a solution to this dilemma. I am not aware of any satisfactory solution. I am aware that one approach often suggested is to qualify the defence by reference to international instruments in a somewhat similar way to that suggested in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment. I indicated to the committee my concerns about that approach, in particular the fact that international conventions arise in the context of a binding international agreement on states and, at least in this State, do not establish criminal culpability.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have chosen an approach which leaves it to a court to decide in what circumstances criminal culpability arises. This approach does not prevent a court from taking into account any international agreements which are applicable in this State and which the court considers would leave no ground for a defence of lawful sanction in relation to a criminal charge of torture.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I pointed out difficulties with the proposed amendments which have been resubmitted. In Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, the legal effect of the reference to &ldquo;without prejudice to any international instrument . or enactment&rdquo; would probably be no more than the creation of the statement of the obvious &ndash; that such instruments are not affected by the section. It is confusing to add such a reference and I would be concerned at the creation of such confusion. The reference to international instruments could cause problems in a definition of criminal behaviour, as I already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would also have difficulties with the reference to domestic enactments, as it could raise doubts as to whether sanction prohibited by our law would have to be deemed unlawful in accordance with the section, if committed in another country. This could mean, for example, that an executioner performing his functions in the United States of America could be prosecuted <Col N="537" /> under this section because the death penalty was finally abolished as a sanction in this country in the Criminal Justice Act, 1990. We might abhor the death sentence in this country but that does not give us the right to decide that a person acting in accordance with the legitimate law of his or her land should be liable to criminal prosecutions here. I understand the good intentions of Deputy Jim Higgins's amendment but I am afraid it does not achieve the clarity he is seeking. It is simply a circular definition.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that the intention behind the convention and, therefore, behind the Bill, is not to ensure that all the possible cruelties of the world can be prosecuted in this State but rather to provide a framework for the prosecution or extradition of persons in cases which may be important in the context of the international effort to bring persons who engage in torture to justice. The Bill does this unequivocally. I realise this is a complex matter and I understand the concerns of Deputies Higgins and O'Sullivan. However, these concerns are best met by my approach. I hope that in the circumstances, the Deputies will understand the position and realise that I cannot accept their amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying he will leave the courts to interpret what is difficult for his draftspersons to put into law.

      <P>In page 4, line 11, after &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided such act or sanctions do not contravene the definition of torture assigned to it by this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will press the amendment because, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, the Minister is effectively placing the onus to make a decision on the courts. The matter can only be brought before the courts if it is referred by someone. Obviously the State is happy with the current position and has no intention of doing this. Who will bring such a case to the courts to decide whether there has been a contravention of the convention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) A person, other than a person referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> or <i>(2)</i>, who carries out an act of torture on another person, whether within or outside the State, shall be guilty of an offence of torture, but shall be liable to be prosecuted in the State if that <Col N="538" /> person or the victim of the offence is an Irish national or if that person subsequently enters the State or if the offence was committed in or has any other substantial connection with the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We debated this matter on Committee Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to extend the scope of the Bill beyond public bodies to cover what might be described as private torture. I have acknowledged that it is difficult to draft appropriate wording in this regard but it is permitted under the UN convention to allow national laws to offer a wider definition of torture. I recognise there are limits to a worldwide unilateral Irish prohibition of purely private torture which is why I have inserted a requirement of connection with the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister responded to this on Committee Stage and said it would be difficult to implement such a provision from the point of view of our State because it would extend the scope of the Bill too much. However, I resubmitted the amendment to discuss the matter further and see if it is possible to extend the scope of the Bill. There are reports of widespread torture in various parts of the world which is not state torture but is organised by groups. There is concern that there is no way to deal with private torture under UN conventions which only deal with torture carried out by or on behalf of a state. I am anxious to discover if it is possible to extend the scope of the Bill to include what might be described as private torture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to extend the scope of the Bill to non-state torture. The issue was discussed fully on Committee Stage. The definition of torture in the Bill gives full effect to what is contained in the United Nations convention which specifically recognises the peculiarly evil nature of state sponsored or condoned torture and the need for an international system for the prosecution of such torture. Non-state torture is another matter.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, torture already constitutes a serious offence under our criminal law. The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, updated our law in the area of non-fatal offences generally. It includes a wide range of offences for which heavy penalties are prescribed. Accordingly, a person committing physical acts of torture here would be amenable to the criminal law. Nor could persons committing acts of torture outside this jurisdiction find a safe refuge here as such offences are, in all probability, likely to be extraditable. The important distinction is that the international community has not identified the need for an international system of prosecution of such offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most often quoted case of non-state torture which should be criminalised is the phenomenon of paramilitary punishment beatings or kneecappings currently occurring in Northern Ireland. Our jurisdiction over such behaviour is already established by the Criminal Law <Col N="539" /> (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976. Accordingly, including such behaviour in this Bill, in so far as acts committed in Northern Ireland are concerned, would be largely a duplication of law. I strongly believe that extending the scope of this Bill to non-state torture would dilute its importance and purpose and could have unforeseen consequences for its application when enacted. This Bill is, and should be seen as, exceptional legislation to deal with exceptionally abhorrent behaviour. In the circumstances, my position on the matter has not changed and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the meetings referred to by Deputies and numerous other meetings, I wish to report to the House some very significant developments. I have laid before the House a statement issued by both Governments on Friday, 5 May and a letter to the parties in Northern Ireland sent by both Governments on Saturday, 6 May. The statement by both Governments on Friday, 5 May, was responded to by the IRA on Saturday, 6 May. The British Prime Minister and I welcomed the IRA statement and announced that, following consultations with the International Independent Commission on Decommissioning, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, the former President of Finland, and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, former Secretary-General of the African National Congress, had agreed to head the recurrent inspections of a number of IRA weapons dumps, as set out in the IRA statement.</P>
      <P>Following intensive discussions and negotiations, we have secured a map for the comprehensive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As the Governments indicated in their statement, subject to a positive response to what we have proposed, the Secretary of State Mr. Mandelson plans to sign an order to enable the Northern Ireland Assembly and its Executive to be restored by 22 May next, the second anniversary of the referendums that overwhelmingly endorsed the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be familiar with the background to the situation. In my statement to this House on 15 February, following the suspension of the institutions, I expressed my disappointment at what had transpired, but I pledged that we would dedicate ourselves to ensuring the earliest possible restoration of the institutions, so that the progress we had all welcomed could be built upon and developed. In the period of their suspension the institutions have been sorely missed and commentators and politicians on all sides have expressed the need for local, inclusive and accountable governance in Northern Ireland and for the effective operation of the North-South institutions. Senior political figures from Wales and Scotland have looked forward to the activation of the British-Irish Council.</P>
      <P>Few anticipated the progress achieved in the time when the institutions were in place. We have now regained the opportunity to build on that work and to re-establish the basis that will allow democratic politics to flourish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all, the progress we have made allows us to fulfil the democratic wishes of the people as expressed in the referendums, North and South, following the successful negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. The people voted then in <Col N="542" /> overwhelming numbers for a new beginning, a new future. In this process there cannot be winners and losers because that is only storing up trouble for the future. We have now, the potential for a win win situation but the opportunity must be grasped. The prize in our grasp is bigger than the individual concerns of any party.</P>
    <P>It is the obligation of all democrats to ensure that the violence of the past is firmly put behind us and that we achieve a new way forward. In this regard, the IRA statement of Saturday, 6 May, is highly significant. I have always said the IRA ceasefires and the ceasefires of loyalist paramilitary organisations have made a crucial contribution to the search for peace. Now, the commitment by the IRA, as set out in its statement, to resume contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning; to initiate a process to completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use in such a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure maximum public confidence; and the agreement to put in place a confidence-building measure to confirm that weapons are secure are all immensely positive developments. Furthermore, the IRA repeated in the statement that there is not a threat to the peace process from it and that it saw a political context &ldquo;in which Irish republicans and unionists can, as equals, pursue our political objectives peacefully&rdquo;. All of this represents a significant and historic advance on the part of the republican movement.</P>
    <P>We also look to early commitments by the loyalist paramilitary organisations. I would like to express my warm appreciation to Mr. Martti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, both of whom are widely respected international figures for agreeing to undertake the inspections.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning had been a persistent challenge, which had to be addressed satisfactorily. It would be a serious mistake if other matters were to overshadow the achievement of what has been accomplished. It was also critical that we address issues around the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement. This has now been done over a range of outstanding issues. For our part, we stand ready to offer whatever clarification the parties consider helpful. With regard to security, the British Government will progressively take all the necessary steps to secure as early as possible a move to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland consistent with the level of threat at the time. The statements of the weekend before last have been highly significant and, in response, the British Government will take further substantial normalisation measures by June 2001. A number of important measures in this regard were announced last week, which I warmly welcome. We will continue to oppose with resolute and determined action any group that uses or threatens violence to disrupt this process and we will take whatever measures are necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>We have a timetable for the implementation of the Patten report and the criminal justice system <Col N="543" /> and yesterday saw the publication of the policing Bill. The need for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland is central to the Agreement. It is in the interests of all in Northern Ireland that the police service be able to function fully and freely in all areas and across all communities. People from both communities want to be able to give unqualified support to the police service and want police men and women to be made welcome in every home.</P>
    <P>The publication of the police Bill yesterday was another step on the road to implementing the Patten Commission recommendations. However, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated, there are some issues that give cause for concern and need to be addressed during the legislative process. At the end of the day, what is essential is that the SDLP and Sinn Féin be in a position, for the first time, to encourage young Nationalists and republicans to join the Northern police service. To do this, the legislation needs to deliver a police service which will be acceptable in every town and village in Northern Ireland. Both the British and Irish Governments are fully committed to this, and I am convinced that any difficulties can be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>It is also in everyone's interest that the criminal justice system delivers a fair and impartial service, is responsive to the needs and concerns of both communities and has the confidence of the public to deliver an efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>With regard to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, incorporation of the EHCR into British and Irish domestic law will take effect from October 2000. This will require legislation in this jurisdiction. As Deputies will be aware, the Human Rights Commission Bill is before the Oireachtas and the Irish Commission on Human Rights will be established in July 2000, so that the Joint Committee of both Human Rights Commissions required under the Agreement will, therefore, be established by the end of July. The British Government will ratify the Council of Europe Charter on Regional or Minority Languages by September and significant measures relating to the Irish language will also be taken.</P>
    <P>It is now up to all of us to ensure that the restoration of all of the institutions provided for in the Agreement becomes a reality. I call on the pro-Agreement parties to respond positively to recent developments. I also urge all those in civic society, who have done so much to support the process from the start, to once again lend their support. Some have already done so. I welcome in particular the statements by the two Primates and by the Group of 7 in Northern Ireland. We have a unique opportunity to pursue democratic politics constructively, for the betterment of everyone on this island and on these islands. We have the opportunity to build trust between parties and between communities. We have the opportunity to work together for the sake of all our futures. The alternative would only play into the hands of those who seek a return to confron<Col N="544" /> tation and mutual distrust. It is only in that atmosphere that extremism and violence can flourish.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all of those who have worked so hard in recent weeks. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Attorney General, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, all of the pro-Agreement parties and officials of both Governments, who worked tirelessly and intensively on this process and continue to do so. I also pay tribute to the smaller parties, the Alliance Party, the Women's Coalition, the PUP and UDP for their constructive contributions. I thank Deputies in this House and the leaders of the other parties for their assistance. Once again President Clinton and his Administration have been unstinting in their support, including through the issuing of statements after the Government's statement of Friday, 5 May and the IRA statement of Saturday, 6 May.</P>
    <P>The result of all of our efforts is that real progress was made at Hillsborough. The story of this process to date has been one of an historic achievement being followed by a period of frustration. The reality, however, is that we now have the potential to move to a new phase of exciting political development and economic and social progress within a framework that can deliver true equality. To realise this, everyone in positions of leadership must show the courage to seize this opportunity.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ongoing formal and informal contacts with political representatives, the Government endeavours to keep in touch with the broadest possible spectrum of opinion in Northern Ireland. In this regard, I and my office continue to avail of the good services of individual clergy and community leaders to help further the cause of peace, stability and reconciliation. They have an important role to play and I have always valued their support, as on this occasion. However, I have not had any formal meetings with church leaders recently.</P>
    <P>On 13 April the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in reply to priority questions, said that the Garda Commissioner had asked a senior officer to investigate the allegations that had been made about gardaí in relation to a number of murders. I replied to the letter I received from Mr. David Trimble on the matter on 14 April and I conveyed this information to him.</P>
    <P>There have been no discussions to date about a possible visit to Ireland by President Clinton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the inquiry by the Garda Commissioner into the possible passage of information by a member of the force to the IRA yet been concluded? Will the Taoiseach indicate the exact parts of the policing Bill as published and now before the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, to which he has objection? Will he identify in specific terms the problems he sees? <Col N="545" /> In regard to the IRA statement that it will put arms beyond use, does the Taoiseach understand that to mean that each weapon would be rendered physically incapable of use or, simply maintained in some place where it is intended that nobody would allow it to be used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, my understanding is that those investigations are ongoing. In reply to the second question, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out last night, we have particular concerns. We have done an analysis of the Bill over night. We have concerns about the provisions relating to structures of accountability, that is, the policing board and the ombudsman, and particularly their power to initiate inquiries as clearly envisaged in the Patten report. We have also concerns about the membership of the policing boards and the district policing partnerships that they should be representative of the broadest possible cross-section of the community as detailed by the Patten report. In respect of the human rights aspects, we are concerned about the contents and scope of application of the oath. They are the main areas. We have a number of other questions and concerns about the legislation, which we documented. As stated in my reply I think they can be satisfactorily dealt with. The Bill was published yesterday afternoon but already we have an 11 page detailed list of concerns from the SDLP and a three page list of concerns from Sinn Féin. Those lists will be extended enormously.</P>
      <P>To reply to the third question, my understanding of the position is that the arms will be in dumps and a number of these will be inspected, as stated in the IRA statement. They will be secured and inspected on an ongoing basis. The operations of this will be worked out by Mr. Martti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa in conjunction with General John de Chastelain and his commission. The move from secure dumps to destruction of weapons on another, unspecified day, would also be regularly monitored in the remit that will be extended to General John de Chastelain and I hope the task will be worked through successfully over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen to the arms in the dumps that are not to be inspected? What control would there be over their use? Is there any assurance that punishment beatings involving the use or the threat of the use of IRA weapons will not continue? Does the Taoiseach consider that the use of IRA weapons and the possible discharge thereof in the course of punishment beatings or shootings represents a breach of the ceasefire? Will he indicate approximately what proportion of the total of IRA dumps he expects will be inspected? Does he expect it will be a number that constitutes about half, most or less than half? What exactly are his concerns about the contents of the oath to be administered to members of the new Northern Ireland police service? To which aspects of the oath does the Irish <Col N="546" /> Government object? What problems has he with the proposals in regard to representation on the police boards? What precise changes would he envisage on the boards? What groups does he believe should have reduced representation to allow the additional representation that he is presumably seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into second guessing the work that will be undertaken by the de Chastelain commission in conjunction with Mr. Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa. They started to discuss the operational aspects on Monday and will work out in the immediate days ahead how they will inspect the dumps, how they will monitor and seek control of that and how they will check back. In regard to the arms that are not in the dumps&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the dumps that are not being inspected, we have seen from the IRA statement that it is its intention to continue to maintain them under its management as it has maintained dumps successfully over the past six years. I hope, over time dumps can be included in the remit of the independent group examining them. As indicated in its statements, the IRA will be responsible for making sure there is not a misappropriation of these arms and that they will not drift into criminal activity or into the hands of other subversive or dissident groups. This is a matter of concern. The IRA is very conscious, as we all are, that these guns should not be used. We have emphasised that time and again to the political representatives of these parties. Sinn Féin has also made statements about punishment beatings even though punishment beatings have been reduced substantially, by about 25% in the first four months of this year compared to last year which was down on the previous year. We want to see the elimination of all punishment beatings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask, through whatever means of communication he had with the IRA prior to the issue of its statement, if it would issue a statement in regard to the involvement of IRA volunteers or IRA weapons in punishment beatings? Will he agree that the IRA should have made a statement saying it would cease forthwith to support punishments of an extra legal kind? Has the Taoiseach reflected on the implications of the acceptance by an Irish Government of arms dumps being, as he put it, continually under the management of an organisation which is illegal? Will he indicate how long he expects these arms dumps to continue to be under the management of an organistion in this category? Will he revert to the earlier question I asked about the oath and the police boards?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to deal with that, but the Deputy indicated that he wished to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, it is my fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My position is that I want all the dumps identified and all the guns and arms handed in and disposed of tonight, but that is not likely to happen. The Government's position remains that the Garda or the Army will continue to search for such dumps. They will not cease searching for dumps. If we knew where they were located, they would be put out of action quickly. That will continue to be the position. A number of dumps have been found over the years and I hope more will be found.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the independent commission and the two independent individuals who will monitor the situation will work out the arrangements for the international body. The IRA says that guns are not drifting in and out of other dumps which cannot be found or sourced. It is not a satisfactory position, but it is better than the way it has been for the best part of three decades. We will continue to do all we can to ensure the disposal of these arms.</P>
      <P>One of the things Mr. Trimble asked me to do was to endeavour to get a statement on punishment beatings from Sinn Féin. This issue was raised after the IRA statement on decommissioning. We have been working on the issue of decommissioning in recent months, but the issue of punishment beatings was subsequently raised. We asked Sinn Féin to deal with that matter and it made a statement, which has been welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but my difficulty, as usual, is that I only deal with Sinn Féin and, as the Deputy said, whatever sources are available to me. Perhaps this is unsatisfactory at times but that is the way it must be. My conduit to the IRA is Sinn Féin; I do not deal with the IRA directly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the policing boards and the pledge. In relation to the policing boards, there is still much debate about how the district partnerships will be addressed. The Patten report contains detailed pronouncements on how the district policing partnerships should operate. It states that they should monitor police performance, raise resources for community funding, meet in public etc. However, my problem is that these proposals are not included in the Bill. They probably have been deferred until decisions are made on the community safety element. There are no requirements in the Bill and we will have to pursue those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make too much of our posi<Col N="548" /> tions on these matters at this stage. We have an enormous number of questions and the SDLP, which has taken a particular interest in this matter, has even more. It is most concerned about many aspects of the Bill. However, we will try to bring some legislative influence to bear on the issues raised, particularly those which are of concern to us. Many of these issues are important and generated an amount of anxiety &ndash; I will not put it any stronger than that &ndash; in the North overnight. We will do our best, from the Nationalist community, to assess what is the best thing to do and to put forward our views. There were meetings last night with Seamus Mallon and we will keep in close touch with Sinn Féin and the SDLP on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the most important decision to be taken over the next few days is that by the Ulster Unionist Council? The House should at this time be sensitive to the legitimate concerns of that body to ensure that the institutions can be reinstated next Monday with the First Minister and his executive colleagues in place and willing to participate. In that context, does the Taoiseach agree that the problems of so-called punishment beatings are the other side of the coin of the absence of an acceptable police force? At this time anything we say south of the Border, which has been in effect enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, should be sensitive to the concerns of the Ulster Unionist Council.</P>
      <P>Assuming that Mr. David Trimble, who has not yet incorrectly read the numbers in his party, is successful on Saturday, as I hope, when will all the institutions be reinstated? When will the civic forum be established? What input, if any, will the Irish Government have in relation to the composition of the civic forum?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding his first point. His comments are eminently sensible. We have spent the past ten days almost exclusively trying to work, in whatever way we can, with the British Government and the parties in the North on dealing with the other issues which have been raised. Few questions are being raised about decommissioning anymore. Operational issues remain to be worked out in that regard.</P>

      <P>I accept the view of the House. However, it is worth pointing out, in the spirit of Deputy Quinn's comments, that we should be extremely helpful to all the parties. We all agree on that and there is no difference. An enormous amount has been achieved and this is a significant breakthrough. We have spent endless hours, days and weeks trying to address this issue and we have reached this point.</P>
      <P>In addition, Mr. David Trimble has won my respect and that of many others for his excellent work. He moved on the Good Friday Agreement and maintained the issue of decommissioning as an obstacle, although we all would have preferred him to move away from it. That was the issue which brought down the executive and created the difficulties. It created all the uncertainty and it was the reason for the order which ceased devolution. That issue has been dealt with, although perhaps it has not been addressed entirely. People in Mr. Trimble's party and elsewhere should realise that the issue has been addressed.</P>
      <P>I put this alongside Mr. Trimble's other major achievements, which were signing off on the constitutional issue and the changes to Articles 2 and 3. Some people may forget that they were not easy to achieve. Other issues included the principle of consent and the institutional changes that he achieved. Sinn Féin had to move and change its constitution to allow it to take part in the Assembly. All these matters should be taken into account in terms of what people have achieved. However, I am concerned that all the achievements could be taken off the list while people move on to concentrating on a particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, we need to understand that we have tried and will continue, within <Col N="550" /> the legislation and by all other means, to satisfy reasonable need. Everyone has put in a great effort and I hope that, after all the major issues, be they constitutional, institutional, changes in parties or decommissioning, that we do not now get into a wrangle over whether the RUC will be called the RUC today and what it will be called after 1 September 2001. The Patten report stated that the RUC would not be abolished, nor will it. We are talking about a new beginning so that there will be proper policing and so that there will not be punishment beatings and problems in areas. I am not saying what I will not do. I am being as helpful as I can. If that issue can be resolved, and it is quickly becoming a major issue, then we will be able to move on Monday to quickly establish the institutions.</P>
    <P>I agree the civic forum should be set up quickly because we desperately need to create balance in many areas. It needs to include the groups which will be represented in G7, the smaller parties, equality organisations and organisations active in either community, and they should play a key part in it. We do not have an enormous statutory or implementational role. I assure the Deputy that we will do all we can to encourage it to be an organisation which has the full participation of as many important civic groups as possible, from trade unions to employers to cultural groups to equality and humanitarian groups. I would prefer if we were dealing with this issue next Monday morning and not still trying to deal with issues which are difficult to resolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has partly responded to my question in the context of the forthcoming debate in Belfast, a debate which will be public, unlike the Army Council debate and vote. Does the Taoiseach agree that the proposals from the Patten committee for the modernisation of police services in Northern Ireland do not, as he said, constitute the abolition of the RUC, rather its modernisation, and that, of the 175 recommendations contained in the report, if the five which refer exclusively to symbols and names were excluded, the other 170 which allow for different local government structures could be usefully applied in principle to the Garda Síochána? Does he also agree the people of Northern Ireland, who are suffering from the imposition of vigilante terrorism, otherwise known as punishment beatings, would recognise that we in the South have a problem in terms of the modernisation of our own police force, and that there are lessons for all the people on this island in terms of the necessity to modernise police forces on an ongoing basis? Does he also agree Patten should not be seen as some type of &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; insult to the tradition of policing in Northern Ireland which, for one community, is seen as a defensive force, and for the other, as an oppressive force. Does he agree we must go beyond that, that restating prejudices is not helpful in the current climate, and that we must understand the fears <Col N="551" /> and aspirations of both sides? Is it the Taoiseach's intention between now and Saturday to communicate with David Trimble or to try to assist the process of normalisation of politics in Northern Ireland by sending whatever signals would be considered supportive without being intrusive to the Ulster Unionist Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our aspiration and desire is for Saturday to be successful. All the matters I mentioned, all the changes and progress made, the confidence building measures, all that is happening with decommissioning and all the other aspects of the agreement we set out in the Government statement are designed to achieve a successful conclusion as regards the Ulster Unionist Council conference and vote on Saturday. That is what we want to achieve. I have responded in writing twice this week to David Trimble. I have been in touch with him and will continue to do so. We are working closely with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson. We have been in contact several times a day and will continue to do so to achieve our aims.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Patten report, it is worth revisiting its origins. We could not reach agreement on exactly how policing should be dealt with in the discussions on the Good Friday Agreement in the time available. That is not surprising. The issue of policing has been so complex and sensitive that the parties to the Agreement felt it best to request an independent commission to make proposals for a police service which would be acceptable to all parts of the community so that all communities, be they Belfast, Derry or rural areas, could have a successful police force.</P>
      <P>Chris Patten and his colleagues did an excellent job in coming forward with an authoritative set of proposals which I agree with the Deputy could be used anywhere. The head of the RUC has often said he believes almost all the recommendations are good policing and could be used in any country, be it New Zealand, the Republic or Northern Ireland, for example. Chris Patten had to strike compromises between all that he heard. It should be noted that he did not just sit down and write the report in London or in the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast. He spent all winter holding consultative meetings in the community. He did that along with Senator Maurice Hayes and the other commission members who were from the United States and who had enormous experience of policing in other countries which had racial discrimination and divided communities. The report was a set of balancing compromises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton, we have been looking in our examination at where the Patten report has moved <i>vis-à-vis </i>the legislation. We do not have any hang-ups about it. We are merely seeing where it has moved from this balance. We welcome the introduction of the Bill and are committed to its full implementation. The issues of the <Col N="552" /> RUC foundation and the oath were raised and I can understand some of the concerns in that regard. There is a certain logic about some of the changes to be made. While we want to discuss it, the important point is that it is successfully implemented.</P>
    <P>We have worked closely with David Trimble on the Good Friday Agreement and on the constitutional aspects. We, the people and the parties in this House, have delivered to him on the consent principle for which the Unionists have fought for 70 years. We changed Articles 2 and 3. We established institutions and urged Sinn Féin to change its constitution. David Trimble then insisted on decommissioning. We continued to try to find a successful solution to decommissioning. We have not gone overboard in our comments on the changes in the Bill yesterday, although we are worried about many of them when viewed against the Patten report and we will have to argue and debate many of them. At the same time, we are sensitive to people's positions. We have agreed to the inclusion of the RUC foundation in the Bill because it is something which was sought. These are all important matters. We have supported the plight of the widows and I am due to meet the widows of RUC members shortly, as I am sure other parties will do.</P>
    <P>We will do all we reasonably can. However, we cannot ignore the SDLP, especially in this case, because it put in years of work. Deputy Currie will tell me how long because I do not remember. It put in years of work and held endless meetings on policing. It has said that we will not achieve the principles of the Good Friday Agreement if policing is not got right. I cannot agree to anything which parties such as the SDLP cannot sell to its members.</P>

      <P>Like others, I too hope and pray the Saturday meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council will allow the institutions to be re-established. I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions, one of which relates to Mr. Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa. To whom are both gentlemen directly accountable as regards the operation of their inspections and what is the relationship, both legally and in terms of operational matters, between General de Chastelain and the inspectors? Has the Taoiseach or the Government been in contact recently with the Ulster Unionist Party or Mr. David Trimble to offer a view on the various aspects of policing reform currently being debated in terms of whether a postponement of the name change is acceptable or the insistence on a neutral name would supersede any aspect of retention of the name &ldquo;RUC&rdquo; or whether there is any more useful communication that can be entered into to ensure a full and frank exchange between now and Saturday in order to avoid any difficulties that might arise? </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, the two individuals have taken on the role in an independent capacity. They will deal, in the first <Col N="553" /> instance, with General John de Chastelain. They are independent and they are very conscious, as international figures, of their independence. The arrangements that will be worked out as regards inspections, how they will move, travel and report back will be very much dictated by them. So that we will not tie them into a remit we have not taken on&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governments. They are very clear on the fact that they will have to have a working operation and not be moving around. They both have considerable experience in this area. On the second point, as I said in reply to Deputy Quinn, we have been in touch and will continue to help in every way. We want to see full implementation of the Agreement. It is a new beginning. We are conscious the decisions made on Patten ensure we are talking about a new police force that has a cross-community name and serves on a cross-community basis. That has been emphasised very strongly to us in the past few days. We are helping in any way we can without upsetting that delicate balance and, as Patten is already a balance, we must be conscious of that. Much is being achieved and perhaps clarification may be required on a small point but it seems to us that there is an enormous amount to sell.</P>
      <P>I would like to be able to say that every item asked for by every party has been achieved, but that is impossible. We could agree to anything from the safety of Dublin, but what use is that if the Nationalist parties and those who have lobbied and worked on this for years say they will not ask Nationalists to join the police force? Where will that get us? The reality is the RUC is not being disbanded. The RUC Bill will be passed by November. The policing commission will be set up in the springtime. The first recruits will come in September. The force will have a new name. That is the clear position of the British Government, and the Irish Government is happy with that.  Anything that changes that will only create difficulties and unravel the position.</P>
      <P>People sometimes forget that the Irish Government and parties had a problem trying to stop people objecting to Patten. It is only now that we have succeeded in getting the Nationalist side to agree that Patten is acceptable because of the balances that were in the report. I cannot balance it any more.</P>

      <P>How many times have you heard <Col N="554" /> me say that policing is the potential Achilles heel of any settlement? Unless young men and women of both traditions in the North can join the police service, almost inevitably, the new institutions will fail. Does the Taoiseach agree that, for understandable political and historical reasons, one section of one community in the North has been negative in its attitude to policing &ndash; it is not our State, parliament or courts and it is certainly not our police service? Does he agree that even in optimum circumstances there will be a considerable task in getting people from that Nationalist and republican background to join the police service? Does he agree that getting Catholics and Protestants to join is not sufficient, particularly in relation to the Nationalist community? They must be young Nationalists and young republicans ideally similar to those who joined the Garda Síochána in this State, particularly those with a GAA background. That is what we must achieve, otherwise what we have been involved in will almost inevitably fail. Will the Taoiseach, if he has not already done so, spell that out to all those who are talking about things that are important but secondary such as, for example, which flag will fly where. Unless we have a police service that is acceptable, those issues will cease to matter.</P>
      <P>There are other matters on which I hope the Taoiseach continues to talk to Sinn Féin such as the so-called punishment shootings, the disappeared&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie and people should note what he said. His colleagues from times past and the SDLP have been making those points. They are eminently sensible. The case has been put that if we really want to go forward &ndash; I believe we do and that everyone means well &ndash; we cannot ignore the points. It has been put to me by the SDLP that to make any permanent references that strike at the core philosophy of the Patten report and changes that would mean that it will not be a new beginning and would be a conscious decision to deprive the new police force of cross-community support. It would lead to division among the communities on the very name of the police. It used to be offensive to Nationalist elements of the community and members of the force if Nationalists were to join. Unless these issues are dealt with correctly, the force will be made unattractive to Nationalists. It is difficult for people in the Republic who may say you can put this or that into a section, <Col N="555" /> but that is not how it is seen in the North. If it is done a certain way people will not join the force. We know of cases where dual names were carried for a number of years and enormous difficulties were created.</P>
      <P>Having achieved so much of what we have all worked for on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the constitutional aspects, changing the Constitution, which all parties here supported, accepting the principle of consent and now convincing others to accept institutional changes so that there will be an assembly in Northern Ireland, and the issue of decommissioning is resolved, if not totally satisfactorily, this is the opportunity for people to go to their various meetings, positively and constructively, and support these initiatives so that we can set up the institutions and move forward. This is the opportunity for people to go to their various meetings with a positive and constructive attitude &ndash; it is not just one party &ndash; and to support these initiatives so that we can set up the institutions and move forward. We should not get ourselves hung up on other issues that can be dealt with in the legislative process or in a calmer, saner environment in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>A consultants' report commissioned by the Department on air safety, including training and operational requirements of the Air Corps at Casement Aerodrome, and carried out by Sir Frederick Snow and Partners has been received and is being examined. There are no plans to publish the report at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the future use of Baldonnel, its utilisation for civil aviation purposes, is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public <Col N="556" /> Enterprise in consultation with myself in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard, the recent report to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance on the future of Aer Rianta considered the possibility of a second airport in the Dublin area and this was considered in the context of Baldonnel Aerodrome. This report by Warburg Dillon Read and AIB on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome. Its recommendations will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. Following consideration of the report, it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and I will report to Government with specific recommendations on the future of Baldonnel. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what those recommendations will be.</P>
    <P>My Department has lodged an objection with South Dublin County Council in connection with an application by the FAI to erect a new stadium at Gibbons townland as the proposal may impact on the Department's policy on the safety of aviation operations and the future development of Casement Aerodrome. In this regard, my officials have met representatives of the FAI to discuss the matter and the Department has clarified its position in relation to the FAI application. The most recent meeting between the Department and the FAI took place at the end of March and at that meeting it was agreed a report would be prepared by the Air Corps on the impact of the proposed stadium on Air Corps operations from an operational and safety viewpoint. The report has just been completed and is under examination in the Department. My Department was in touch with the FAI last week and I expect the Air Corps report will be the subject of further discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to make the details of the Air Corps report available to the FAI? Have any other drafts of these reports been given to other Departments? Will the Minister confirm whether the report he has received states that the development of the FAI stadium, Eircom Park, will have no impact on safety for Baldonnel? Is that correct? What is the problem with publishing the reports that are available? Is the Minister's Department playing ducks and drakes with the FAI on this issue, perhaps for political reasons related to the development of the national stadium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense. The question of operational safety, particularly for training young pilots at Baldonnel, is crucial and not one to be tossed around in a frivolous way, as Deputy Fitzgerald appears to be doing. It is not normal to publish these reports, but to be honest, I do not mind. As soon as we have finished our examination of the report I am quite happy to publish <Col N="557" /> it, not just for the FAI but for others also. This 45,000 seater stadium is not in the flight path but in the training path, but we want to be absolutely sure there is no diminution or weakening of the safety standards around Baldonnel, no more and no less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I raised this issue. Obviously, the safety issue is extremely important, but equally it is important to publish the reports and not to delay publication to get the facts out. That is why I am asking whether the reports will be published, as it is in everyone's interests that they be published as soon as possible and that there is transparency. That is why I have raised these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the timeframe for these matters, particularly for the FAI development? I agree that safety is important; we have had a number of tragedies involving the Air Corps and we do not want to create problems. However, the FAI has put a huge effort into planning this stadium and time is of the essence. When will a decision be made on this issue so that the FAI can move on to the next phase of its plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a fanatical sports supporter and I recognise the enormous efforts the FAI and other organisations put into playing facilities. I cannot give a definitive answer as to when a decision will be made on this issue because there is also the Snow report which recommends the application of international civil aviation guidelines. That report is also being considered in the context of the wider use of Baldonnel. That presents some further complications in giving an exact time for a decision, but I do not think it will be too long as both reports must be considered in that context. I would like to be able to make a final decision and to publish the report before the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <P>Is it true the Minister's Department has sought the views of the Irish Aviation Authority, though I understand that body does not normally have jurisdiction over military airports? Will the Minister confirm if that has been done and, if so, why? Also, has the Minister had discussions on the Aviation Regulation Bill, in particular section 46, which is before the Seanad? Did the Minister's Department have an input into that section?</P>

      <P>Before a final decision could be taken on the potential for joint military-civilian use of Baldonnel the Irish Aviation Act, 1993, would have to be amended. Section 3 of the Bill currently in the Seanad, which we discussed with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority, provides that the legal impediment which restricted the possibility of that potential use could be removed. In that context we have had discussion with the Irish Aviation Authority. That body is also responsible for <Col N="558" /> overall civil aviation guidelines and it is retained by my Department for advice on a continuous basis.</P>

      <P>To come back to the FAI, I am happy the Minister said he will do his utmost to publish the report by the autumn and every effort should be made to realise that aim. It is of vital importance to everyone involved that this matter be resolved.</P>
      <P>What capital outlay is envisaged for the development of Baldonnel? What is Baldonnel's position relative to Dublin Airport? I know the facilities are not the same, but are the runways compatible with those at Dublin Airport or would major investment in Baldonnel be necessary in order to use it as a private or military airport? What is the overall view of development at Baldonnel? Development seems sensible in terms of giving a second option. What capital outlay would be involved? Would there be a major problem in developing Baldonnel as a second airport?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of private businesses are interested in private civil aviation in Baldonnel. If the decision was to proceed only with that aspect of development, about £1.5 million would be required for immediate investment. However, a wider and more extended use in terms of commercial civil aviation would require a very substantial investment and major planning and consultation. I cannot put a precise figure on the amount, but I would guess a minimum of between £5 million and £10 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to inform the House of the latest position on implementation of the White Paper on Defence.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the White Paper is moving ahead quickly and positively. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for the management and development of defence for the next decade. This Government has fulfilled its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to define a long-term strategy for defence. This strategy includes a major new investment programme of £250 million in equipment and infrastructure, ensuring we have a modern and sustainable defence organisation with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important element of the implementation of the White Paper is the organisation and <Col N="559" /> resourcing of the Defence Forces. In accordance with paragraph 4.3.17 of the White Paper, I recently directed the Chief of Staff to draw up a draft implementation plan for my consideration and approval which will give effect to the organisational elements of the White Paper. I advised the Chief of Staff that I considered it important that the draft plan adopt a long-term view of the organisation of the Permanent Defence Forces to reflect the ten year time frame of the White Paper. The new organisation, as set out in the White Paper, will be based upon an overall PDF manpower which will not exceed 10,500 with the option of an additional 250 recruits in training. The plan should also provide for the maintenance of existing barracks and should be broadly consistent with the proposals on the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Forces set out in Chapter 5 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the ten year time frame for the White Paper, the draft plan will address the broad goals set out in paragraph 4.3.19 of the White Paper, namely: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation. I have asked the Chief of Staff to submit a draft plan to me by the end of June 2000.</P>
    <P>An important element of the White Paper is the reallocation of resources to improved equipment and infrastructure. I have already announced decisions on major new equipment programmes which are a key element of White Paper implementation. Air Corps capabilities will be augmented through a special £55 million investment programme over the next three years, with the procurement of new helicopters being given special priority.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Naval Service vessel replacement programme has already commenced with the planned acquisition of a second new state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the LE<i> Róisín</i> at a cost of some £20 million. In addition, I announced a multi-million pound investment programme for the Army, worth an estimated £25 million over the next three years. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. This equipment will be of considerable benefit to the Army in carrying out its roles at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, announced investment in new equipment totalling at least £100 million in addition to the £40 million already set aside for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers. <Col N="560" /> Investment of this scale confirms that the White Paper represents a serious response by the Government to a sustained case advanced by the military authorities to develop the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation and we have allocated the funding that this ambitious project will require.</P>
    <P>Other implementation initiatives and measures will be rolled out over time and I will keep the House informed of these as they arise.</P>
    <P>The White Paper makes clear that consultation will take place. Communication is extremely important and I have sought to ensure that everyone is familiar with the White Paper and its contents. The major improvements announced in relation to equipment and infrastructure, I am sure, will be well known to people throughout the defence organisation and I am certain these are welcome. Other implementation initiatives will be proceeded with progressively to achieve the objectives of the White Paper and consultation will take place in accordance with the normal arrangements under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. A comprehensive agenda of items is contained in Chapter 4 of the White Paper in relation to the development of Defence Forces personnel and I am certain the representative associations will want to engage very quickly in these issues.</P>
    <P>The overall objective must be to ensure the country has the Defence Forces it needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people will be proud to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the provision of helicopters and the additional ship for the Naval fleet, what liaison does the Minister envisage between the Defence Forces and the Garda in terms of the massive amount of drugs being brought into the country by sea? Every family is concerned about drugs and I wonder if the Minister is happy that once the proposals in the White Paper are implemented, we will have Naval and Air Corps personnel and equipment to meet the demands of constant patrolling of our shoreline to prevent the importation of drugs or the use of Ireland as a European cockpit for drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A primary concern in the White Paper was to ensure we had the flexibility for very significant investment in infrastructure and equipment so that personnel in the Navy and Air Corps would have available to them the most modern equipment and be able to carry out the duties which the Government may give them. It is important to remember in terms of the Navy, however, that its primary work is broadly concerned with fishery protection, though it has strongly supported the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda in drug interdictions. There have been a number of successful drugs seizures, something which will continue. Co-operation between the Air Corps and the Navy in surveillance and in supporting the Garda and Revenue is very important in ensuring we have the best possible <Col N="561" /> resources to combat this terrible evil. I support the Deputy's contention that there is more work to be done.</P>
      <P>We are in the process of acquiring the equipment I mentioned. Shortly, the high level procurement group will give me its recommendations regarding the type of aircraft which the Air Corps will require and the funds are in place for their acquisition. I have already signed a contract for a sister ship for the LE <i>Róisín</i> and we are also in the process of a major recruitment drive. Manpower policy and maintaining the level of personnel are important elements in the policy.</P>
      <P>I cannot say everything is perfect as difficulties still exist, but we are putting in place new resources and there is a new will to combat the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As one might reasonably expect, members of the Defence Forces across all ranks take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity. While this also applies to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the PDF. First, the PDF pension schemes are among the most generous in the public service. For example, an enlisted man or non-commissioned officer can retire with an immediate pension and retirement lump sum after some 21 years service, often implying a real potential for retirement at about age 40. Moreover, in the case of commissioned officers, a pension is payable along with a lump sum after the completion of 12 years military service. For example, an officer, such as an Army captain or commandant, may retire from the PDF in his or her late 30s and immediately receive a military pension along with a retirement lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> Second, it is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. This always applied across a wide range of traditional trades, such as electrical work and vehicle mechanics. Nowadays, however, military skills training is as likely to encompass well recognised courses of training in electronics and communications and also provide qualifications in computer software and information technology. Many military personnel in all ranks are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and to post graduate degree level in such readily marketable specialisms. Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target for the private sector. The military authorities are aware of such individual personnel being actively head-hunted by private sector employers.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the temporary and once off nature of the former voluntary early retirement scheme, under the Defence Forces review implementation plan (DFRIP) over the years 1996-98, it should be noted that the demographic age structure within the PDF is such that a considerable number of personnel, whether serving as commissioned officers or as other ranks are now at a stage in their careers when they can retire and thus avail of the terms of their respective statutory pension and lump sum entitlements on the basis of accumulated years of past service. That this phenomenon coincides with an unprecedented degree of economic prosperity and employment opportunity in the private labour market will continue to challenge the senior management of the Defence Forces for some years to come.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and look forward to reading his reply in detail in the Official Report. Has the recent recruitment campaign been successful? How many people have applied? Are serious gaps emerging in some ranks? Are the Defence Forces finding this a problem in respect of certain tasks? Has the number of members leaving implications for services overseas? I understand the Government, for example, is considering a request to send extra members of the Defence Forces to south Lebanon.</P>

      <P>Recruitment is ongoing and all the indications are that there will not be a difficulty filling the 750 vacancies listed. The cadet competition is popular with 749 eligible applicants for 200 places. We will not have great difficulty meeting the required numbers. With regard to the effect of people retiring early, clearly losing people in a number of specialised areas in the prime of their lives is not something one would like to continue but, as I have explained many times, it is fantastic that this challenge faces us because for too long the options were not there. Young people have opportunities to work and engage their talents when they graduate from university and we should look on that positively. The Deputy will appreciate that when an individual retires, somebody else is promoted in his place. There are promotional opportunities when people retire early and it is good that promotions occur earlier sometimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we began the continuous recruitment programme we have had little or no difficulty in meeting our overseas commitments. We may <Col N="566" /> have some difficulties at times in certain specialised areas and that is one of the reasons we were anxious to ensure in the White Paper that members of the reserve with the required training and ability would be provided with opportunities to fill these positions as they emerge. There is enormous demand in the commercial private sector for certain specialities and we are not able to compete with the remuneration offered. Recruitment is going well. We will meet our target. We are a little stretched overseas because Ireland is providing its highest level of service for years &ndash; 872 members &ndash; and we are doing our best to introduce innovative programmes in the human resources area to make sure skills are maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 146, 147 and 148 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force is based on the report of a special steering group established by me in January 1998. The group produced its report in September 1999 and the recommendations in it have been accepted as a general basis on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed. As I have indicated previously, I plan to publish the steering group report in due course. I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the reserve has been undertaken involving a considerable <Col N="567" /> amount of work by both the military board, which was set up by the chief of staff, and the steering group. The steering group met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, which made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern and it met the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association on three occasions, which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February, recognised that a feature of the FCA is that it has a countrywide geographical spread which will in general be retained. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the implementation process which will consist of the development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes will take place over six years. There will be a requirement for the military authorities to consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of reserve units within each brigade area and I am advised by the military authorities that such proposals are being drawn up.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions by other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve, which come within the scope of representation, will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>The steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments so that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces training centre. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments will hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these posts has not yet been established it will form part of the implementation process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>How large will the integrated RDF element be? Will the reserve comprise a two-tiered system? What resources does the Minister intend to make available to both <Col N="568" /> elements of the reserve? How soon will the reserve be asked to serve overseas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Army Reserve will comprise 12,000 members. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with PDF units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation and the other element will provide an overall Army Reserve, which will be organised in three brigades and trained along standard military lines. When the reserve was examined one of my concerns was that maintaining numbers would be difficult, as is the case in many organisations which have a large voluntary complement. I, therefore, sought to provide new accommodation and equipment, training, overseas opportunities and consultation with employers and I examined how our human resources system provides for such consultation. That is why provision was made to restore two week training courses and to provide weekend and night training and other facilities, such as uniforms, arms and equipment. All these resources must be part of the implementation plan to make it more attractive.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the response of the representative association. I attended its conference, which was extremely positive, and I hope we are opening a new chapter in terms of what RDF members can do. There was a little neglect in the past which we are eradicating and, I hope, we can get the numbers back up to a level at which we can make a difference.</P>

      <P>The number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving on overseas missions is 872. Details of these missions are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces has resulted in a significant increase in the number of volunteers for overseas service. I am happy to report that there were sufficient volunteers to fill all appointments in the 87th Infantry Battalion UNIFIL, which departed for service last month.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of moneys owed in respect of UN missions overseas, the only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of $1,087.10 per person per month.</P>
      <P>The total amount owing to my Department by the United Nations as at 30 April 2000 in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Forces personnel in UN missions, is calculated at £7.1 million, approximately. Continuous efforts are made to recover the moneys owed from the United Nations. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concerns regarding arrears. Since 1 January 1999, the UN has repaid arrears of £9.5 million approximately, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL in South Lebanon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the UN owes us so much money. I know that all the relevant Departments are trying to ensure it is paid, but surely the fact that so much money is outstanding is holding up progress with regard to the Department of Defence? In a previous reply the Minister answered many of the issues I wanted to raise. FCA members may have some of the crafts and trades that are required for the establishment of overseas missions, so that matter should be examined. Has the Minister reviewed the situation concerning apprentices and will apprentices be taken on this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to say the Defence Forces are awash with money and that we are not really being held up because of moneys due to us from the United Nations. We are well able to manage without it for the time being, but that does not lessen the continuous effort to make sure these arrears are paid. In fairness to the United Nations, there has been a progressive improvement in the past 18 months. We have to bear in mind that one major donor country is considerably in arrears in making its contribution to the UN, which presents difficulties for the United Nations. It is important to realise that progressively, as regional organisations take over peace-keeping missions under UN mandates, it will be particularly dependent upon donor countries producing their own resources in order to make this happen in future. We must plan for that eventuality.</P>
      <P>We do not have anything missing in terms of our existing contingents. As I said earlier, we have special problems concerning some specialities which we are able to manage, although just barely sometimes. Overseas missions will have a morale-boosting effect on the new reserve following longer training with better equipment and facilities. However, due to the preparations that have to be made, this will probably not take place for a year. As far as the apprentices are concerned, we look to the existing institutions, where possible, to provide essential apprenticeship courses and training, and draw our numbers from there.</P>
      <P>As has been proved, it is not possible for the Defence Forces to expend the kind of money which was expended in the past. The institutes of technology and other educational institutions are well suited to doing that and we can draw from that resource. I have given a commitment that in areas where this is not catered for I will look to see what the needs are and how they can be addressed. It is a minor problem in the overall context of educational and technical support services in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government taken a decision on providing extra troops in south Lebanon? As regards the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on service overseas and the sad and disturbing reports on the men who were murdered in south <Col N="572" /> Lebanon, will the Department follow up on some of the issues raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity of seeing the programme last night but I have to confess that I was not familiar with these problems until I saw it. I immediately called a management meeting this morning to discuss what we could do. I understand there has been some contact with my Department today from some members of one of those families. It made for very sad viewing because it was clear that wrong decisions were taken at the time and that the safety of the troops should have been of a higher priority in the context of how things were done. I will have to examine the matter further to see what intervention I can make.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's second question, we are considering such a request. It is fair to say that we would be able to increase our numbers if the requirement was proven. It is important to realise that we have to have close monitoring of what is happening in south Lebanon and how matters develop up to 7 July, the date for the proposed withdrawal of Israeli forces to the border. In one sense, it is unusual to receive a request of this nature when a peace process is supposed to be working. One would imagine that over a period of time the deployment of troops would be reduced rather than the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would certainly be the expectation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, we are examining the matter. We are in a position to make some adjustments in terms of increased numbers but we must have further discussions with the force commander and deputy commander in Lebanon, as well as with the Israeli authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on last night's television programme. It would be very welcome if the Minister could become involved and deal with some of the issues, even at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me if it was necessary to order members of the Defence Forces to go overseas recently, especially to the Lebanon? In other words, was there a shortage of volunteers and, if so, how many? Is this something that is relatively new? Did I hear the Minister correctly a few minutes ago say that he expects the new reserve to be in a position to go overseas within the next 12 months? Can he confirm that is what he said? What are the specific problem areas the Minister referred to with regard to special skills that are required overseas and in the Defence Forces generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Deputy's final question first, they are the medical and engineering areas, and sometimes the culinary area. The practice has always been to have volunteers only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For one reason or other, some people have <Col N="573" /> been given different reasons they should not serve overseas. It is important that the management examines all that to see whether those reasons are justifiable. In essence, 99.9% of the people who go abroad are volunteers. A tiny percentage have to be coaxed a little. That is the best way I can put it because it is not something in which I am directly involved but it is something I have come across in the context of representations on behalf of very small numbers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the FCA, it is probably ambitious that it can happen within a year but in the context of some of the people I know who have considerable training and experience in the specialties where we have some difficulty, it would be important to open up that facility as quickly as possible because it would get the implementation plan, morale and the different problems being experienced in the reserve moving a little better. We need to get that co-operation with the PDF as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise. I had not realised the question would be reached but I am glad that has happened. There are two areas I want to focus on, and I hope there will be no repetition. I am concerned about the changing security position in southern Lebanon. What considerations now influence the Minister in the context of those changes? Ireland has been engaged in honourable service there over many years. How does the Minister see our role in the future in light of the withdrawal and the possible new situation in the area?</P>
      <P>My other question involves a more hard-nosed financial concern, namely, the outstanding moneys due to us from the United Nations and the steps, if any, the Minister can take to get rid of that long-standing hoary chestnut. What are we doing about it? Why will it not pay up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to keep in closer consultation with his colleagues as to what is happening. There has been a considerable improvement in the past year and a half. Arrears in excess of £9 million have been paid but there are outstanding arrears of £7.1 million. It is working better than it was previously. I explained already that some of the donor countries are very much in arrears so the United Nations has its own problems. For the future, as regional organisations under UN mandate take over peacekeeping, the pressure will be very much on the countries contributing troops to make their own arrangements and we have to prepare for that as well. We are looking forward to successful peace negotiations in the Middle East. There are a considerable number of problems ahead that have yet to be resolved for us to be sure of the safety of our troops in south Lebanon in the new scenario. We welcome Barak's statement. We hope it <Col N="574" /> can be fully implemented and that the other matters relating to that can also be ironed out. We are in constant touch with the Israeli authorities and the commander, first commander and deputy commander assessing the situation. We have been asked for additional troops. We are in a position to meet some of that requirement but we are waiting to be sure that the overall position is safe enough for us. As I have said publicly on a few occasions, I do not want our troops to be caught in crossfire in difficult circumstances, and we need to iron that out first.</P>

      <P>Is the old Hadad militia, the SLA, still operational in the area or where does it stand in the whole equation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still operational. Some commitments have been given over the years as to what would happen in the peace circumstance. I do not want to go into that in detail in the House but it would be one of the areas that would present real problems for us if anything were to go wrong in the context of commitments that were given in the past. I do not want to say any more on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with Deputy Fitzgerald's remarks in relation to last night's programme and I am pleased that the Minister intends to take some action in relation to same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that the Minister and I are on the same wavelength with regard to people being coaxed to go overseas. Is the Minister saying that no soldier was ordered &ndash;&ldquo;detailed&rdquo; is the word used in military parlance &ndash; to go overseas recently? The Minister said that 99.9% were volunteers. Does that mean that 0.1% were ordered to go, or what does it mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure 99.9% is often given, and I gave it in that context, as meaning there were virtually 100% volunteers, and that has always been the position. It has been greatly eased by constant recruitment but, as I said earlier, it came to my notice, and I was trying to be as fair and open as I could be to the House in the context of the question, that there were small numbers in certain specialties where the kind of repetitive reasons given over the years for not going tended not to be acceptable in the long run, having agreed to them in earlier times. Whether the Deputy regards that as coaxing or whatever&mdash;</P>

    <P>Both of these contracts were awarded by the Government Supplies Agency following a tender competition which included advertising in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the national newspapers. Tenders were received from 12 companies and following examination, contracts were placed with the two companies which submitted the lowest offers. These contracts were placed in the knowledge that the fabric and garment in both instances were to be manufactured overseas. Ireland's international obligations on procurement prevent the contracting authority from specifying where the goods are to be manufactured or from discriminating on the grounds of country of origin in its assessment of tenders.</P>
    <P>The particular disruptive pattern used in the new uniforms was designed by the Defence Forces following trials carried out with various patterns already available, including testing for performance using night vision equipment. The selected pattern is unique to the Defence Forces. No outside agency was involved in the design of the disruptive pattern and, therefore, no cost arose in this regard.</P>
    <P>The new uniforms are manufactured from what is described as a 50% polyester-50% cotton mixture rip-stop material. A precise specification was supplied to tenderers and was based on a similar specification which had been used satisfactorily for a number of years for clothing for the Army ranger wing. The Government Supplies Agency examined suits delivered initially to ensure that they conformed to specification and that it was satisfied with the results. In accordance with normal practice, the military authorities will monitor the suits in use. The military authorities have indicated that the new uniform is so far satisfactory and that no difficulties have been reported to date with regard to washing or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that the design of this pattern was done entirely in his Department and in the Defence Forces and that the Defence Forces and his Department have the expertise to design what the Minister called a unique pattern for this uniform, and that they can do so satisfactorily?</P>

      <P>This is an area in which the military authorities have built up considerable expert<Col N="577" /> ise over the years. It was important to take account of the type of activities that our soldiers would be involved in and the different climates, from the cold in Kosovo to the humidity in a place like East Timor. I am satisfied, on the basis of the trials that have been carried out, that the military authorities put intensive effort into the design and preparations before a final decision was taken.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the initial batch was not unsatisfactory but that a contract was unfulfilled. I have no knowledge of an unsuitable initial batch. I understand the company concerned was not able to meet the contract in the timespan set down by the authorities and as a result it is void.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the design of this uniform is specialised, not an<i> ad hoc </i>operation? Who in the Defence Forces designed the uniform and what are his or her qualifications? Is he or she a graphic designer? I was not aware we had such highly qualified people in the Department or the Defence Forces. Is the Minister aware of the possibility of the print washing off these uniforms? Will this affect the infra-red reflector built into the uniform, with a corresponding safety problem for our soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of an<i> ad hoc </i>approach to a serious change in the Defence Forces such as a uniform upgrade which involves significant funds. We wanted a new uniform for years, one made of light material which would be warm in cold climates and relatively manageable in hot climates. I am surprised the Deputy is surprised we have this kind of talent in the Defence Forces. We have been able to manage in all parts of the world and to improvise and compromise as good as the best. I am happy this applies to this speciality, although I cannot give the Deputy details regarding the personnel concerned. The naming of such individuals is not necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>On the problems with the material and the infra-red reflector, I know from my limited experience that precise washing conditions must be adhered to. In the cases where there were problems, it was indicated to me that perhaps people did not follow these. There is room for further investigation so I can give more detailed information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 73, 89, 132, 138, and 139 together by agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy Barracks, will be evacuated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000. With regard to Ballincollig, the independent consultants appointed to draw up an integrated action area plan for the former barracks undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as part of its <Col N="579" /> commission. The integrated plan for the property has been completed and was presented to my Department and is now with Cork County Council for integration in its development plan.</P>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC and arrangements are being made to put it up for sale.</P>
    <P>In relation to the urgent need for accommodation for refugees, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been used to accommodate Kosovar refugees since May of last year and arrangements are also now under way for the accommodation of asylum seekers at that site. In the interim, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. A number of the proposals received were short listed and those consultants placed on the short list made presentations before a selection committee on 16 February 2000. These proposals are under consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement has been completed between the North Eastern Health Board and my Department and the former barracks was handed over to the board on 9 February 2000 on foot of this agreement. It is envisaged that the child care project proposed by the health board for the site will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested in the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million. The proposal from the NEHB includes a gymnasium, an all-weather pitch and a swimming pool. I understand these facilities will be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated later this year when alternative accommodation becomes available. I expect the sale of the property will proceed in 2001. As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Three hundred Kosovar refugees are residing in Magee Barracks, Kildare, and it is also proposed to house 150 asylum seekers there. The people of Kildare have accepted this decision. Will the Minister ensure the report on the proposals for this barracks is progressed as quickly as possible? The people of Kildare think the process will be slowed down because of the latest changes. In fairness to these people, a quick <Col N="580" /> decision should be made in this regard to give them the impetus to put forward their ideas for the development and advancement of the area so that facilities can be provided for everyone involved, including the refugees and asylum seekers. I ask for a commitment from the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister previously quoted a sum of £50 million which will become available from the sale of Army barracks. Will that amount have to be revised given the short-term change of use of some of the barracks, for example, in Kildare? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have revised the amount substantially upwards, in excess of £60 million, notwithstanding the other difficulties. I did not anticipate the problems which arose as far as Magee Barracks is concerned. I appreciate the co-operation of the community and public representatives in Kildare, notwithstanding their disappointment, and mine, that we were unable to proceed with the plans, on which I had consulted with Deputy Wall, local representatives and the commercial and other voluntary interests in the town. Nonetheless, we have a wider obligation to the Kosovars and the asylum seekers. I cannot state for certain that we will revert to the integrated area plans. It is a significant block of land, ideally located in terms of the development of the town. I would like to be more optimistic and hope we will revert to the original plans, but I cannot be sure.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 24, after &ldquo;life.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;However, if the court is satisfied that the person was acting under duress or threats to his or her life the Court shall have discretion to impose a lesser sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the penalties for the offence committed. A person, whatever his or her nationality, and whether within or without the State, who attempts to commit or conspires to commit the offence of torture, or does an act with the intent to obstruct or impede the arrest or prosecution of another person, including a person who is a public official, in relation to the offence of torture, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.</P>
      <P>I seek to mitigate that in certain circumstances. The Bill sets out to deal with official torture in all its forms and guises and there is a definition of torture contained in the definition section of the Bill. We are giving effect to the United Nations convention. There is a problem, however, that people who are doing their political masters' bidding could be caught in this. They might have no option, there is a gun to their heads. We should seek to mitigate that somewhat &ndash; after &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life&rdquo; in line 11, we should insert &ldquo;provided such act or sanctions do not contravene the definition of torture assigned to it by this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister focused on the word &ldquo;liable&rdquo; and said the courts could exercise discretion. I would focus on the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. There does not seem to be an option. I would have preferred &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence and may be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life&rdquo;. What we consider a discretionary choice for the courts might be more explicit than we realise. The terminology is binding in what it conveys to the courts by way of the sentence option.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment provides that, where a person acts under duress, that person would not be subject to a life sentence. As Deputy Higgins has said, the Minister said on Committee Stage that section 2 does not provide for a mandatory life sentence. The maximum penalty under section 2 is a life sentence but a court is free to impose a lesser sentence if the circumstances warrant it. Such circumstances would not be limited to duress but duress is, in law, a defence to a criminal charge. There is nothing in this Bill which changes the applicable law governing the offences.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;Where a person has before the commencement of this Act carried out an act of torture, whether within or outside the State which was at the time of such commission an offence against international law by reason of the fact that either&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)the act was carried out at any time and constituted or was carried out in the course of a crime against humanity, an act of genocide or a contravention of the laws and customs of war, or</P>
      <P>(b)the act was carried out on or after the 10th day of December, 1984, and constituted a contravention of the Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York on the 10th day of December, 1984,</P>
      <P>and which was at the time of such commission an infringement of the law then in force of the State or of Saorstát Éireann by reason of being an unjust attack on the rights of any person, whether within or without the State, being rights recognised at such time by the Constitution or the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, such person shall be liable to prosecution for that offence in the State and on conviction on indictment thereof shall be liable to imprisonment for life.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. When we debated this on Committee Stage, we referred to the case of General Pinochet and his proposed extradition from Britain. This amendment would ensure that such a situation would not arise in this jurisdiction and that it would not be possible for someone to plead that, because this legislation was not in force when the act was committed, he or she should not be tried for the crime or extradited. The arguments in the Pinochet case centred on the fact that the relevant legislation in Britain was not in force when General Pinochet carried out the offences. It is an attempt to ensure there is no loophole in Irish law to allow such a situation to arise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the list of proposed legislation, there is a new Bill from the Department of Foreign Affairs, entitled Twenty First Amendment of the Constitution (No. 6) Bill, to provide for a referendum to ratify the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. The question of providing for some manner of retrospection in relation to international criminal law arises here and it may have relevance to this amendment. We are proposing that, when the offences were committed, they were an offence at the time under international law and would have been an offence if they had <Col N="584" /> been committed in this State at the time. Obviously, however, it is questionable whether they would have been considered to be an offence in the country in which they were committed. If the person running the country committed the offence, it is doubtful it would be considered to be an offence. They are clearly offences in moral and international law.</P>
    <P>The amendment ensures that there is no loophole through which a person who had committed horrific acts in another jurisdiction could claim clemency in this State and avoid extradition or trial.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, which seeks to make the offence of torture retrospective in law, cannot be accepted. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the fact that on Committee Stage, the Minister explained that he was sympathetic towards the amendment but was constitutionally precluded from accepting it. Article 15.5 of the Constitution contains a prohibition of the enactment of retrospective legislation which declares acts to be an infringement of the law which were not so at the time of their commission. Much ingenuity has been used to draft the amendment to get around the constitutional prohibition. In recognition of this, the Minister asked the Attorney General to check the wording once more. Unfortunately the advice available is that the problem remains and there is no constitutional way to achieve the aim of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Ireland takes a dualistic approach to international law. Despite the adoption of the United Nations convention by the General Assembly of the UN in December 1984, no offence is created in Ireland until provided for by our criminal law. Unless the acts constituted an infringement of the law at the time of their commission, to give retrospective effect to the present legislation would be contrary to Article 15.5 of the Constitution. If the legislation had been enacted at the time the offences were committed, we would be able to take action against them. However, when enacted, it will enable us to deal with actions that might be taking place elsewhere. In the circumstances, I regret I will not be able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the parliamentary draftsman was not able to come up with appropriate wording to give effect to what is proposed in my amendment. I did not draft it, as I do not have the capacity to draft such a complicated amendment but, as the Minister of State said, the person who drafted it was aware of the constitutional prohibitions and was careful to use words that would comply with the Articles of the Constitution. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not find the words in the amendment acceptable or put forward a more appropriately worded amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter. Many international human rights crimes were committed in the past <Col N="585" /> before various Bills were enacted in different countries. We all want to ensure people do not get away with committing such heinous crimes against their fellow human beings. I will press my amendment.</P>

        <b>: </b>In supporting this amendment, I wish to say it has been acknowledged that in drafting it the Labour Party has brought a large amount of ingenuity to bear on it and it has gone as near as possible to making constitutional something that is unconstitutional. Article 15.5 of the Constitution is quite explicit on retrospection. I asked a question on Committee Stage to which I did not get a reply. I asked if an attempt had been made to make a law retrospective in its application in order to have it subsequently tested and challenged.</P>
      <P>When we pass this Bill, we will deal with the Sex Offender Bill, 2000. Approximately 384 people who, in many cases, committed the most heinous sex offences, many of them against children, are in jail. A register will be drawn up to ensure such offenders are compulsorily registered so that they can be monitored, tracked and subject to surveillance as to their whereabouts at a particular time. While that will be done to protect the public, not a single offender currently detained in Arbour Hill, the Curragh or Castlerea can be put on that register because of the prohibition in Article 15.5 of the Constitution. While there is a difficulty in this regard, has the possibility of introducing flexibility in the application of the Constitution been examined or tested? Is there any scope, loophole, chink, or possibility for the introduction of such flexibility in the application of the Constitution?</P>

      <P>Following the return of the Bill to the Seanad, it will then be soon enacted. It is long overdue and I hope we will be able to overcome some of the issues raised here.</P>
      <P>The Bill marks a commitment by Ireland to take its place with the rest of the international community in the effort to protect people against the use of torture by paving the way for a ratification of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> I am pleased this Bill, when passed, will bring to 27 the number of Bills passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas since the Government took office. I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff for their assistance and co-operation during the passage of this Bill. I also thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate and, in particular, the main Government and Opposition spokespersons for stimulating a thought-provoking and constructive debate.</P>
    <P>In the discussions on this Bill, there has been little difference across the divides of the House. All were at one in a wish that the legislation be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The international community has provided a framework for international protection against state torture. That framework is the United Nations Convention against Torture. The convention seeks to ensure that those who engage in such torture cannot evade prosecution in any of the territories of the parties to the convention. It does this by providing a common framework for the criminalisation of torture and provides a method of international prosecution of torture.</P>
    <P>The House has strongly supported the Bill, which will enable Ireland to ratify the convention and participate fully in this important international effort. Many Deputies pointed out during the debate that this convention should have been ratified at a much earlier date and some amendments tabled have sought to make its provisions retrospective. The Minister shares this concern and, on taking office, recognised the importance of Ireland's ratification of this convention and took immediate steps to have the necessary Bill drawn up.</P>
    <P>More and more it is becoming a fact of life that we cannot be content to watch out for what happens in our own country only. Our forefathers fought long and hard for Ireland to take its place among the nations of the world. Now we have achieved that honour, we must make sure we fully play our part. The Government is committing to ensuring that we do. Proof of that commitment is not only the taking of this Bill but that five of the 14 Bills before the Oireachtas from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform contain proposals to give effect to international agreements and conventions. These include the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1999, the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and the Criminal Justice (Illicit Trafficking by Sea) Bill, 2000.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies would have preferred if we could go further than the convention and I understand their good intentions. However, the debate in this House has shown this Bill cannot be a panacea for all the ills and cruelties of mankind. The best must not be the enemy of the good. The convention provides for the good and this Bill follows the convention approach. It provides a good and sound basis for us to ensure that those who <Col N="587" /> torture their fellow human beings cannot expect to find a safe haven in this State.</P>
    <P>I hope this convention will be very shortly ratified and we will have in place, for when we may need them, the powers to ensure those who have engaged in torture can be brought to justice. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí a thug tacaíocht don Bhille agus é ag dul tríd.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister of State about its contents and consequences. The sooner it is passed into law the better. In doing that, we will fulfil our international obligations. I agree with the comments consistently made to the effect that while we willy nilly sign up to conventions, we display considerable tardiness, at national level, in enshrining them in our domestic law. While it must be a nightmare for the Department which has to deal with a huge workload, ongoing demands, and unforeseen demands which come out of the blue, when we sign up to an international convention we have an obligation to ensure everything is done to ensure effect is given at domestic level, to the convention which we merrily signed.</P>

The world is becoming smaller in terms of our interaction with out countries. There are continual obligations on us to participate in whatever way we can at international level to make the world a safer and better place. We must do whatever we can in terms of co-operation with law, policing, drugs and other matters. The enactment of this Bill is one way of co-operating because torture, in itself, is abhorrent to all of us. We must do whatever we can in terms of international co-operation. While I tried to extend it further, nevertheless I am pleased the Bill is being passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and pay tribute to Deputy Dan Neville who introduced a Bill along these lines, in opposition, two years ago and who has done a great deal of work in this area. He made a substantial speech here when the Bill was introduced by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill and its provisions will be helpful. I commend the Minister for introducing separate representation for victims of rape in particular circumstances. This is a welcome section which introduces separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases during applications to deduce evidence on cross-examination of the complainant's past sexual experience. This issue has long been debated and the Rape Crisis Centre and many others would like to see this provision extended to include separate representation for all rape victims. There is no doubt that many cases are not yet brought to the courts. One of the reasons is that victims feel intimidated by the procedures and the lack of legal representation. It is welcome to see some bit of an open door in this legislation for those victims. It will give some encouragement to people to bring cases although much more action is needed before victims will have full confidence in going to the courts with these cases. It is a serious matter that victims of rape still have so little confidence in court procedures. The separate legal representation being provided for is important. Some of the research reports published recently recommended it. I welcome the Minister's action in relation to it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sex Offenders Bill means there are mechanisms in place with the Garda for the notification of certain issues in relation to sex offenders. For example, it creates a new civil court order against sex offenders whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda Síochána reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. It is important that this new civil court order has been created as it will give reassurance to communities. On the other hand we do not want the provisions of this Bill used for any type of vigilante action by communities. That would not be helpful either for communities or the individuals concerned. The Bill also creates a new offence for sex offenders who seek or accept work involving unsupervised contact with children without informing the employer of their conviction. I assume this includes voluntary work and I would appreciate if the Minister would respond in regard to that matter. I assume if they worked in a voluntary capacity they would be covered. It also provides for the post-release supervision of <Col N="589" /> sex offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service. The question that arises here is one of resources. Will the Probation and Welfare Service have the resources to do this job effectively? My colleague, Deputy Higgins, has raised frequently the issue of the serious lack of resources for the Probation and Welfare Service. Additional resources will have to be provided, given that it is being assigned extra tasks under the Bill, if it is to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>Overall this is a welcome Bill. The scale of current and past sexual abuse that has unfolded in Ireland is extraordinary. It is one of the sad realities that has to be confronted. Huge demands are being made on the resources of the two specialist units in Dublin, St. Clare's and St. Louise's. This is not a problem that belongs to the past, it is very much a problem that has relevance today. The Sex Offenders Bill is one aspect of dealing with the issue. Let us not think it is a panacea for the problem of child sexual abuse. To deal with offenders is an important aspect of the problem. Other speakers have said it is not about focusing on a cure. That would be naive. One has to look at containment and supervision issues. It is important to get the right balance.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of treatment facilities for adults and children. Any practitioner one cares to speak to in this area will highlight the shortage of treatment facilities. There is a shortage of treatment facilities in our prisons as well as in our communities. Given the huge pressure on community care, treatment issues are down the list of priorities. That is a shame. We have to work towards improving the treatment facilities that are available both in prison and outside. We should take note of the research from other countries. It is clear that some offenders can benefit from treatment. We must be careful not to put everyone into the same category and say these people cannot benefit from treatment. Research carried out by a man called Browne in the UK showed clearly that there can be a good outcome for some offenders if they get treatment at the right stage and in the right way. It is important not to write people off. The best protection for children is to work with these offenders and try to ensure they do not commit offences again. All offenders are not in the same category, they vary tremendously. Treatment should be matched to people who can benefit. While the recidivist rate is high it should not prevent us from trying to develop the range of treatment strategies and facilities available to deal with sex offenders.</P>
    <P>Another group on whom we should concentrate resources is young offenders. I spoke with a clinician in this area who said it is important to work with the young teenager who abuses because the cognitive distortions which they have are not so fixed that they cannot be treated. Many positive things can be achieved if they are helped to understand the seriousness of what they have done, if work is done on why it happened and strong behavioural programmes are put in place with good supervision. People are often surprised when they realise it is often older teenagers who abuse younger children. It is a particularly <Col N="590" /> important group at which to target resources to ensure they do not develop a pattern of life long abuse. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. Some programmes have been funded in the Dublin area but, undoubtedly, they need to be funded throughout the country also.</P>
    <P>Regarding expertise in the Garda Síochána to deal with this issue, Deputy Neville gave some disturbing examples. Paedophiles obviously operate in a clever way. There are no boundaries and they make use of the Internet. Does the Garda have the necessary resources to deal with the methods developed at an international level by paedophile rings? Are gardaí receiving training? Does the Garda link up with other police forces with experience in this area to enable new issues to be tackled?</P>
    <P>There are no boundaries or borders in this area. The register which will be established under the Bill will ensure there is more protection in Ireland and that it is not a refuge for people who have been forced out of other countries such as England or other European nations. The register will ensure they do not feel Ireland is a safe refuge and this is an important protection.</P>
    <P>At present only the Garda Síochána will have access to the register. What procedures are in place if it needs to share information on it with others? Deputy Neville also raised this issue. For example, if there is a need to link up with a local group, which unwittingly employs somebody who does not say he has a history, what action can the Garda take? I ask the Minister to address that issue and to reassure the House about the flexibility the Garda has in relation to using the register where necessary. What protections are available for any abuse of the register?</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill. The various issues I mentioned need to be addressed in addition to the broader ones regarding child sexual abuse. There is a need to consider the treatment facilities and to work in the education area so children feel safe reporting abuse. The Stay Safe programmes should be developed throughout the country. In retrospect, the misjudgment of the people who argued against the stay safe programmes is clear. They are an important part of the armoury involved in helping children to protect themselves. I hope they will be supported in schools and communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contribute to the debate because the Bill is important in so far as it relates to children. As my specific responsibilities relate to children, I come in contact with many people and I am aware of the incidence of abuse and the effect it has on children. There is an onus on us all to take all action necessary to ensure children are protected in whatever way possible from people who put them at risk and particularly from paedophiles and sex offenders who steal their innocence and childhoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the preparation of a children's strategy, I <Col N="591" /> have consulted widely with children and young people. I have received letters from children, telling me how they were abused and saying their lives have been destroyed. There is evidence of young people who developed serious behavioural disorders and who cannot settle in home or residential home situations. Much of this can be traced back to their sexual abuse. Statistics show that much of this may have taken place within the family circle or involved people whom they knew. I hope we can work at the level of early intervention and support for people and their families to protect children.</P>
    <P>Where we are aware that people have convictions for sex offences and that they may be, on the basis of that type of conviction, a threat to young people, it is important to do everything possible in legislative terms to protect all our citizens but particularly children. Much legislation is needed in this regard. This legislation is the third Bill to be introduced and it will add to the body of Acts already in place.</P>
    <P>The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, set out to protect children in other jurisdictions but particularly to take action against people who carried out offences against them while on holidays or abroad. Its purpose is to ensure there is no escape for such people in Ireland. The purpose of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, is to ensure children cannot be trafficked for sexual exploitation. It also deals with pornography on the Internet and made the creation, distribution and possession of child pornography an offence. This also applies to the Internet, which is a major challenge because sexual offences and offenders do not recognise international boundaries. As countries, we must work together to provide extra protection for young people.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the Council of Europe Social Affairs Committee in Dublin Castle on Monday and it was interesting that one of the questions asked was whether offenders can be prosecuted in Ireland for offences which took place abroad. They were pleased that this is possible. In addition, by virtue of this Bill, if sexual offenders are living in this country, they will be obliged to register and give information. It would be helpful if all other countries introduced similar legislation. This would allow us to work together to protect children from abuse, attack and threat of harm.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a sexual offenders register in providing tracking and notification systems will ensure there is up to date information. Computerisation will ensure information is available throughout the world when people are moving. If a person is registered on the system, he or she must notify the Garda if he or she intends to leave the country. This will verify that one is leaving the State and not only going under ground. In addition to all sexual offences committed against children, a wide range of other offences are also covered. The length of time for which people will <Col N="592" /> be on the register reflects, in a fair way, the nature of the crime and the sentence. It does not lump them all into the one group. It recognises that offenders also have rights.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the Garda can use this information properly. It is particularly important that it can be used to ensure that where knowledge exists, a close eye can be kept by the relevant people, the Garda, to ensure no person is put at risk. There is no point in merely having the register. Part 3 refers to the behaviour of these people and provides for special orders so that, if the Garda believes sex offenders on the register place people in danger by hanging around inappropriate places, such as playgrounds, school gates or areas where children might be put at risk, it can intervene and protect the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill places an onus on sex offenders to notify potential employers that they have a record and are on the register. That also applies to voluntary organisations. Of all groups, voluntary organisations sought this type of security for the people with whom they deal. Children and young people depend to a great degree on volunteers to provide them with sporting activities, to form clubs and organisations and to organise outings, events and camps and take children away for weekends. Therefore, these people are with children in a close environment. Voluntary groups need to know volunteers are of good character and standing.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers any person who works in a voluntary or employment capacity and who has access to children. This is a great safeguard for voluntary organisations to ensure they can continue to work with young children and not feel afraid. Unfortunately, in the past few years an element of fear has crept in among volunteers. They believe everything they do is being watched because of the past incidence of sex offences in different areas of sporting activity. We need to ensure they feel their work is valued while also taking steps to ensure they are protected.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I commend the Minister on introducing separate legal representation. During my time on the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, we heard submissions from a number of delegations, especially the Rape Crisis Centre, which requested this measure. It applies under the Bill where a person's past sexual history is being explored in court. Women are entitled to this representation. They have often felt daunted by the procedure and, even though they have been the victims, they have often felt they did not receive the sympathy and support they needed as victims and that, in many cases, they were on trial. By having separate legal representation, their rights as victims will also be recognised.</P>
    <P>The legislation, which goes on to give post-release supervision, should be used in conjunction with other measures providing treatment and therapy to offenders to ensure there is not as much incidence of reoffence. The addition of this <Col N="593" /> strong legislation &ndash; no person should apologise for it being strong &ndash; will support all activities involving children, volunteers and groups and will ensure the protection of children by providing that information relating to sex offenders and people who might offend again is in the hands of the right people, namely, the Garda, to be used as it sees fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Like those who have spoken in this debate, I welcome the legislation. The introduction of a register of sex offenders is inevitable given that such a register was introduced in the United Kingdom and has given rise to the understandable fear that, unless a similar register is introduced here, sex offenders from Britain will flee to this country. However, one must put the role of the register into perspective and see that it is part of a much larger picture.</P>
      <P>One of the strange aspects of sex offending has been the marked lack of a coherent approach to the problem. Lenient and inconsistent sentencing in many rape and sexual assault cases has been rightly and severely criticised by the National Network of Rape Crisis Centres. The centres instanced three serious cases all of which were heard within a short time of each other and where inexplicably lenient sentences were handed down. One case involved a serious sexual assault on a 17 year old girl by four youths. The incident was described in court as mere &ldquo;horse play&rdquo;. This was accepted by the judge and a community service sentence was handed down. The second case involved a sentence of a mere two years given to a priest who sexually abused and destroyed the childhood of at least nine boys. A jail sentence of two years was totally inadequate in the context of the evidence graphically presented to the court. The third case involved a County Cork school principal who admitted 21 sample charges of indecent assault and was sentenced to a three year prison sentence.</P>
      <P>While there have been many successful prosecutions which succeeded in drawing down adequate sentences in terms of their severity, especially more recently, cases such as the three I outlined undermine much of what has been achieved in putting sexual assault into the serious criminal category to which it belongs. The handing down of lenient sentences in serious cases has undoubtedly led to many victims being reluctant to go through the trauma of a court case and facing the possibility of being identified, at least within their own community, only to have a derisory sentence imposed by the court. While no two cases are exactly the same, we need a judicial system which guarantees at least a minimum level of sentencing consistency. There is a long overdue need for non-statutory judicial guidelines to assist this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month there were 354 convicted sex offenders in prison. Only ten of these were receiving the intensive treatment programme at Arbour Hill, which is the only prison where such a programme is available. To have only ten of the <Col N="594" /> 354 convicted sex offenders receiving intensive therapy or treatment is an absolute scandal. It has been categorically proven that treatment and therapy work, yet they are not available in prisons except for a tiny minority. The Curragh has a quota of sex offenders, yet it has only one part-time psychologist and one part-time probation and welfare officer for more than 100 sex offenders convicted by the courts. Castlerea Prison also houses sex offenders and does not have any psychologist. Only 6% of convicted sex offenders released from prison last year took part in a treatment programme while in custody. Some 80 prisoners convicted of sex offences were released, yet only five of them had completed the Arbour Hill intensive treatment programme. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform figures confirm that the proportion of sex offenders treated in prison has fallen. In 1998, for example, 11 of the 103 sex offenders released during the year received treatment.</P>
    <P>The number of convicted sex offenders serving prison sentences is now at an all-time high. The Minister defends his performance by saying that many sex offenders are unsuited or unwilling to participate in intensive therapy programmes due to insufficient motivation or emotional immaturity. He has commissioned &ldquo;a major review of the effectiveness of the Arbour Hill programme&rdquo;. There is no need for a review. The Arbour Hill programme is working and is extremely successful. International experience has shown that therapy can and does work. There should be no question of emotional immaturity or insufficient motivation. There should be no choice or option. Such therapy programmes should be mandatory for all sex offenders without exception.</P>
    <P>One must understand that paedophiles, by their nature, do not believe or admit they have done wrong. They are stuck in a psychological mindset and we should try to change that. That is what the therapy programmes are for and that is why they work where they are provided and if they are compulsory. Early intervention is particularly effective, especially where young offenders are concerned. Offenders should be part of such a programme not at the tail end of their sentence as happens at present but from the day they enter prison. Such programmes should be provided at community level as and when the offender moves back into the community but to release 75 sex offender prisoners back into the community in 1996 and 92 such offenders in 1998 without intensive therapy is grossly irresponsible. Yet there is little indication from the Minister that he proposes to improve the position.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my colleague, Deputy Neville published the Sexual Offenders Registration Bill, 1998. That Fine Gael Bill covered people who moved to Ireland following release from prison in Britain after conviction for child sex offences if they had been required to register there under British legislation. The Bill gave wide discretionary powers to the Judiciary. The convicting judge would decide whether the offender's name would <Col N="595" /> be entered on the register on release from prison or juvenile detention centres in the case of an offender between 17 and 21 years. The judge would also rule on the length of time the offender's name would remain on the register. The main consideration would be the likelihood of the convicted person re-offending on release.</P>
    <P>Those under the age of 17 were not covered by the Bill because young sex offenders may not be fully aware of the implications and consequences of their behaviour and often respond very well to treatment which, unfortunately, is not available in most cases at present. Once entered on the register, the requirements in Deputy Neville's Bill were quite strict. The offender must not only provide the local Garda station with his or her name and address but also a signed photograph and finger prints. Any change must be notified to the Garda within seven days and the offender would also have to notify a local Garda station if he spends a total of 14 days a year at another address.</P>
    <P>A registered offender who failed to comply with these conditions would face a summary conviction in the District Court with a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for three months. If the case went to a hearing on indictment in the Circuit Court, the penalty would be a fine of up to £5,000 or imprisonment for up to three years.</P>
    <P>It was a good Bill and one intended to fill a major void. It specified, for example, that the identity of the names of the registered persons would not be disclosed to anyone other than a garda, except in exceptional circumstances. A garda not below the rank of inspector could apply to the High Court for disclosure to a third party in the interests of public safety and the hearing would be held <i>in camera</i>. The purpose of this provision was to ensure that the kind of vigilantism referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald and the hysteria that can often occur on the release of such persons is prevented.</P>
    <P>The Minister flatly rejected the Bill on the basis that he had commissioned a study by his Department into the area of sexual offences. In May 1998 the departmental group produced an excellent report entitled The Law on Sexual Offences. Yet it took from May 1998 to 12 January 2000 for the Minister and his Department to produce a Bill which is now before us and plodding its way through the House. Had Deputy Neville's Bill been accepted the register could have been in place for the past two years.</P>
    <P>One of the disquieting aspects of the report produced by the Department was the suggestion that a register of sex offenders would seem to pose more problems than it would solve. The authors stress that the purpose of any such measure must be the protection of children. However, they point out that not all sex offenders abuse children and among those who do, not all are fixated paedophiles who prey on children outside the family.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a reluctance, scepticism or <Col N="596" /> little enthusiasm for the Bill among the professionals who treat sex offenders. According to Mr. Kieran McGrath, editor of the <i>Irish Social Worker</i>, this is not because the professionals oppose the Bill but because they believe that its measures will achieve little or nothing. Mr. McGrath believes that it will create an impression in people's minds that a major step forward has been taken. Terms such as &ldquo;a tough crack-down on sex offenders&rdquo; make good soundbite material but fail to address the reality of our sex offender population. From the point of view of perception the new measures strike a very responsive chord with the general public and the electorate but, in essence, according to Mr. McGrath, it amounts to a very limited response.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of sex offending about which we know very little. However, there are other aspects which are quite clear. First, it has been clearly established that most sex offenders are well known to their victims. Some 70% of offenders are family members. The &ldquo;stranger-danger&rdquo; scenario that the register is supposed to address is a reality. This accounts for the low prosecution rate, around 5%. In many of the worst cases of incest, for example, no formal complaint is made to the Garda and in the absence of a complaint no prosecution can take place. In many cases, therefore, the Garda never get to interview the alleged perpetrator.</P>
    <P>A sex offenders' register, as we have already said, will exclude a huge slice of the population. As we said during the course of the debate on the previous legislation we discussed, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1999, the Bill is hugely deficient, not through any fault of its own but by virtue of the fact that it cannot be made retrospective because of the consequences of Article 15.5 of the Constitution. That is a problem. The register will not be able to operate retrospectively because this would be unconstitutional and would be seen as interference with the judicial process because only the courts can inflict punishment. Being placed on a sex offenders' register would inevitably be seen as an additional sentence. Thus, the currently known sex offender population, irrespective of how serious or heinous their crimes or transgressions, will have to be excluded from the register.</P>
    <P>There are issues the Minister could have addressed in this Bill but did not do so. For example, it is possible for defendants facing allegations of sexual crimes to conduct their own defence. That is their constitutional right. However, by conducting their own defence they are automatically given the right to interrogate the women or children they are accused of abusing. I appreciate that this option is seldom taken up, although it was availed of in a notorious rape case in England some years ago with obvious consequences from the point of view of the victim. The fact is that it still exists and victims know it exists. It is a very real psychological threat and deterrent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> To return to the attitude of some of the professionals and the general feeling of disquieting scepticism on the part of some professional workers in the field, one is again struck by the comments of the editor of the <i>Irish Social Worker</i>. His summary of the Bill is very interesting. He wrote:</P>
    <P>Social policy formulation should be based on what is shown to be effective rather than on what appeals to the more primitive instincts of the electorate. Sex offender registers may help people to sleep easier at night, in the mistaken conviction that someone is &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; the paedophiles but this Bill will not achieve that objective. It may merely prove to be a safety valve for an adult anxiety rather than a safety measure for child protection.</P>
    <P>We should be somewhat worried that people with hands-on experience dealing with this problem at the coalface, the professionals, express such scepticism. It is something on which we must reflect.</P>
    <P>People across the political divide have supported the thrust of the Bill, as I do. However, I regret its late introduction. Deputy Neville's Bill should have been taken on board and any loopholes or defects rectified. Had that been done such a register could have formed part of the legal regime for the past two years, but the Minister did not see fit to do so. I see it as a public safety measure but in the light of the glaring negligence on the part of the State in failing to make treatment and therapy programmes available it is, as I have said, only one piece of a much larger jigsaw. There seem to be some glaring inconsistencies in that section 29 provides that offenders can be obliged to attend post-release courses. One must immediately ask why they are not obliged to participate in such courses while in prison.</P>
    <P>While rape figures, which are extremely high, are now levelling out, is the reported figure only the tip of the iceberg? As the Minister of State said, representatives of the network of Rape Crisis Centres and other interested parties have come to the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and the impression one receives from them is that the figures are just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that, for a variety of reasons, many rapes are not reported. We may welcome the prospect of independent legal representation for rape victims, which will hopefully encourage more people to report the violation of their person, but there is an ongoing major problem in that rape victims are very often not kept informed by the State of what is going on in their cases. A court case is conducted on behalf of someone whose person has been grossly violated and who is in fear of entering court, yet in many cases the DPP's office does not bother to apprise the victim of progress in the case, where the file is or the likely consequences of their appearance in court. In many cases in the past they were left languishing in total ignorance of what faced them <Col N="598" /> in court. That is appalling and unpardonable. All victims should be kept up to date with the progress of their cases if the State is acting on their behalf, but rape victims should be kept completely up to date and briefed regularly in relation to the progress and processing of their case.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already referred to the failure to properly resource the probation and welfare service, which will be a key cog in the working of this legislation, yet it is the Cinderella service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We have drawn the cost comparisons before and looked at the paucity of resources and manpower within the service. This time last year the service was thrust into the unprecedented situation of threatening industrial action. It had to take strong, affirmative industrial relations action and got a mere 40 additional personnel. That is hopelessly inadequate in the context of its current demands, let alone the demands that this Bill will make of it. It is an excellent service which is totally under-resourced and understaffed. We wish the Bill well, but if it is to be successful, it has huge implications in terms of additional resources for the probation and welfare service. The Minister of State should anticipate the additional demand on the service and the additional personnel and resources that will be involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the House passing the Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill and Members contributed enthusiastically to that debate, but the situation with regard to pornography is appalling. How successful is that Bill? One need only go into any newsagent to see graphic pornography on every shelf. It is readily available and there is no censorship or curtailment on the part of the shops themselves. One wonders if parents really involve themselves in supervising what their children are reading, as it is absolutely appalling, not to mention the Internet and multi-channel television. What is happening in terms of unsupervised access is appalling and the consequences are obvious both in the immediate and the long-term future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a new phenomenon that people are coming to Deputies' clinics with problems related to sex offences and sex offenders. I am very concerned by this because we do not have the professional expertise to deal with such issues and any legislative move to address them is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes a step in correcting the balance of justice in favour of the victims of sex crimes. For too long the perpetrators of these vile acts have had too much protection from the law, particularly when one considers the harrowing accounts of those who have suffered sexual abuse and other crimes which we have heard recently. A consistent theme is that the victims tend to be left on their own to revisit the horrors they have suffered with no help from the State, but this Bill addresses the needs of victims, their families and their communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provision requiring <Col N="599" /> sex offenders to notify the Garda, which has been flagged before. Experts in the field recognise that sex offenders are prone to repeating their crimes and this is borne out by research from around the world. There have been many examples of paedophiles being moved from town to town and parish to parish around Ireland, but those moving them on are burying their heads in the sand in believing a change of climate might cure them. I have been asked by families to visit people in prison, particularly in the Curragh and Arbour Hill. While acting as a form of middleman between family and offender I have often been taken aback by the lack of concern on the part of the offenders. The Bill tries to address this and other issues.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Higgins's point that the Bill may be too late for many victims, but it will protect them from the evil visited upon them. It responds to the needs of victims, who have called for many years for such a system to be introduced. We cannot undo what has gone before, but we can guarantee victims, their families and communities a law that requires sex offenders to notify local gardaí of their new address. This is welcome and although it will not resolve the issue it will give a sense of protection to families.</P>
    <P>The Bill also requires that offenders should report to local gardaí within ten days. I know the Minister has looked carefully at this, but I urge him to change this ten day period to immediate notification. I seek this amendment as unspeakable havoc could be wrought on a child or community in those ten days and as a result of speaking to those who have been victims or whose relatives have been victims. The point is that these offenders have gone through the courts system and are recognised as a threat to communities. For those who argue that the proposal is too draconian, those who are obliged to register with local gardaí are obliged to do so by the courts and not at the whim of a local health official or garda. Registration comes at the end of due process, although ten days is far too long a period.</P>
    <P>Victims and potential victims require every safeguard the State can offer and the sooner the local gardaí are aware of the presence of sex offenders the sooner children and communities can be protected. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this proposal, as ten days is far too long. Notification should be immediate and the reasons go without saying.</P>
    <P>I also recognise an international dimension to the Bill. I welcome the provision that applies the same requirement to those who have committed similar offences abroad. Recently we have become aware of sex offenders who have committed similar crimes in other jurisdictions. A pattern throughout the world, and particularly throughout Europe, in recent years has been that offenders have easily moved from one country to another and it is important that we address this issue. Notification will ensure Ireland does not become a haven for those fleeing similar laws in <Col N="600" /> other countries. Penalties and restrictions are more severe in other countries and we must ensure in this context also that Ireland does not become a safe haven.</P>
    <P>For this provision to work effectively it is important that systems and resources are put in place to ensure registers are updated and maintained across borders. There must be real co-operation between police forces, particularly at a time when international travel is a simple matter. The lack of border controls makes it easier for criminals to move across frontiers. It is very important that the Garda has the resources to ensure offenders are effectively monitored. The Minister has put means at its disposal, but it is very important that resources are always available to the Garda. It might be appropriate to ensure future Administrations do not reduce Garda funding to such a level that it would be difficult for it to effectively monitor sex offenders. I ask for this measure lest it be forgotten that the Bill is aimed at ensuring that our children, the most vulnerable in society, are protected from the evil perpetrators of sex crimes. We want to ensure we never again have a situation where the public or victims feel they are not being protected.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Garda will now have power to seek a civil court order against sex offenders whose behaviour gives gardaí cause for concern. This is a very important provision which will protect the most vulnerable in our communities. It is long overdue for us to redress the balance in favour of the victims of sex offences. The law should provide no hiding place or loophole for sex offenders who perpetrate evil acts. Families and communities throughout the country will welcome this measure. An extension of this provision will also give the Garda power to ban sex offenders from certain areas such as school gates and playgrounds and, importantly, individual houses.</P>
    <P>The Bill begins to bring us to a stage where at long last we are about to give the authorities the power necessary to tackle the menace and threat to the stability and safety of communities presented by sex offenders. Communities at long last will be able to look to Government and recognise that while we have often talked about the need to put in place safeguards and measures, this is the first step which shows the Government and the authorities are becoming involved.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the release of sex offenders from prison. Up to now sex offenders were released from prison in the same way as other criminals. The Bill will make it mandatory for them to be under the supervision of the probation services, a far reaching proposal and I commend the Minister on ensuring the inclusion of this provision. The provision puts sex offenders on a par with all other serious offenders in terms of post release requirements. Coupled with the notification to the Garda, it will also ensure that communities will be protected. Again, it is very important that the Bill wins public support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> At this stage I introduce a note of caution. While the Bill goes a long way towards providing much needed protection for children, their families and communities, they must be ever vigilant. There are a number of ways in which communities and individuals can be pro-active in this regard, for example through community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes and education and awareness programmes in schools, and not just rely on the legislation or the Garda and the health boards. We must also ensure that those who work with children are rigorously checked and monitored. As a member of a health board I often feel we do not go far enough in this regard. Often health boards appear to be a protector in terms of social issues, particularly child care, but too often they have been embarrassed to realise people who worked for them have been found wanting and have been brought before the courts as a result of their illegal activities. We should also move to raise public awareness.</P>
    <P>The law can only go so far and it is fair to suggest that research shows many such crimes are committed by people known to victims. Rural Deputies will be aware of the embarrassment to authorities in rural areas when the offender is well known locally. While we do not want to rely on the rumour machine, often word will filter through in rural communities to beware of a certain individual because of suggestions of interference elsewhere. Too often we have neglected to examine such inferences and I hope the Bill will give support to people with fears about people in their own locality.</P>
    <P>The ultimate protector must be the family and the community. I am at pains to point out that in no way do I attribute blame to families. I merely state that as parents we must be forever vigilant and always ensure the State does everything in its power to help parents maintain this vigilance and remove those who are a menace and a threat to the safety of children, as is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sadly, for many victims this Bill may be too late. However, it is a step in the right direction. It is a very strong Bill which will go a long way towards supporting victims. We accept that the provisions cannot alleviate their unimaginable suffering. We can only hope that with the enactment of the Bill the law and the State will not give any comfort to the perpetrators of sex crimes. The Bill provides communities with a certain level of protection and as legislators we must endeavour to ensure every protection possible is given to the most vulnerable in our communities, namely, the victims and the potential victims of sex crimes.</P>
    <P>Many victims may feel that the level of representation being proposed is inadequate. No right thinking person would wish to see victims of rape or other offences having to face the rigours of a criminal trial. Many victims have complained that all too often they feel like the ones on trial when it comes to the court case. Those who work with victims of rape have said that the experience <Col N="602" /> of victims in court prevents many families from going through with a full criminal trial, something which is regrettable. Nevertheless, the Bill seeks to provide victims with a limited legal representation. The Minister pointed out that while he would like to be in a position to provide greater representation he is unable to do so for constitutional reasons. The Law Reform Commission, in its report on rape, expressed doubts as to the constitutional propriety of separate legal representation for victims of rape and other serious sexual assaults in so far as it might alter the balance of the criminal process and deprive the accused of a trial in due course under law. It is important to remember that the Bill, in so far as is allowable, provides representation during a part of the trial which would be very difficult for a victim to go through alone without legal representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured us that the Bill is part of a series of measures against sex offenders and that complementary measures have already been put in place. The next phase in the process will be to examine the outstanding issues relevant to the criminal law governing sexual offences. The Minister has assured us that issues arising out of the discussion paper on the law governing sexual offences will be put before Government for approval. In the meantime the Government has committed itself to continue to do all it can to make sure our children and other vulnerable persons are protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I wish to share time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is regrettable that such legislation is necessary but, as all Members are aware, every town and village has experienced the pain and hurt associated with sex offenders. New measures are needed to address these serious sexual crimes and to protect families and children. For that reason I welcome this Bill as the response of the Minister and the Government in dealing with sexual predators in the community.</P>
      <P>The legislation contains five key elements. I welcome the new notification procedure or tracking system for all convicted sex offenders and I am satisfied the notification requirement extends to offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad because communities are just as much at risk from foreign sex offenders. I also welcome the sex offender orders, the new system of post-release supervision for offenders, the notification requirement for offenders when seeking employment where unsupervised access to children is involved and separate legal representation in rape and other serious sexual assault cases in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central purpose of the legislation is to impose a requirement on certain sex offenders to notify the Garda of their names and addresses and of any change in that information in order to ensure that records are up to date so that the <Col N="603" /> Garda can carry out its policing function on behalf of the community. My colleague, Deputy Moloney, referred to section 9, which provides that an offender has ten days to comply with the notification requirements. Why is it necessary to give them ten days to do so? If the Garda is to police this issue on our behalf it is vitally important that the whereabouts of sex offenders are known on a daily basis. This is a concern for many victims and their families.</P>
    <P>Notification requirements are used in countries such as the United States and the UK in the form of a tracking system. The purpose of this is that at least if a sex offender knows that his or her every movement is monitored it will, hopefully, prevent him or her from re-offending and will in some way contribute towards his or her rehabilitation. I am aware of instances in my own county where sex offenders have returned to the communities in which they committed their crimes. It has caused a great deal of concern for victims and their families and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The question of rehabilitation has been discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and there has been much debate in the media about prison rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders. The Bill provides that when an offender has served his or her sentence counselling will be provided on release. It is crucially important that while an offender is serving a sentence, he or she participates in a rehabilitation programme. Statistics prove that such programmes help people not to re-offend. Visiting committees have reported in regard to prisons which house sex offenders, that rather than having sex offenders sitting around comparing notes on how they carried out a crime and got away it or how they might do the same again, they should be compelled to undertake a rehabilitation programme. That is not too much to ask or expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I have contributed to debates on this issue on a number of occasions since I entered the House because of the publicity that surrounded it and also because Deputy Neville introduced a Bill almost two years which proposed to establish a register of sex offenders. I was disappointed that the Minister did not accept that Bill but we were reassured that he was examining the issue and that he would introduce similar legislation. I welcome the fact that he has now done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it does not provide all the answers to the problems relating to sexual abuse and sex offenders, it is an important element in addressing the issue. Studies have been carried out which show that 95% of hardened paedophiles re-offend. Counselling, treatment and therapy does not work on these people and, therefore, it is important that a register of sex offenders is incorporated into law. No attempt to cure or rehabilitate hardened paedophiles, who are repeat <Col N="604" /> offenders, will work. Control, supervision, curfews and constant surveillance are methods used to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the public hysteria surrounding media reports of paedophilia and the existence of paedophile rings. Offenders who were obliged to register in Great Britain and, particularly, Northern Ireland have travelled to this jurisdiction. One was quoted as saying that he would go as far as Cork because it was furthest from Derry. That comment was reported in<i> The Sunday Times </i>and it led to much hysteria. I experienced a great deal of reaction on the issue from concerned parents who were worried that such a ring could exist in Cork and also that offenders were entering this jurisdiction. I have no doubt that there were already sex offenders in Ireland before these visitors ever came from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, to compile a register of sex offenders so that people can be reassured that those convicted of a crime of a sexual nature are obliged to comply with it. Parents are concerned about allowing their children outside and giving them certain responsibilities as they grow up, such as walking to school on their own, walking to the local shop, changing their books at the library or going to the cinema with their friends. Children need that independence but at the same time parents are concerned about what they are exposing their children to in the community. They must be reassured that legislation such as this is in place.</P>
    <P>However, I sound a note of caution. It has been mentioned that up to 70% of sexual offences are committed by a person who is known to the victim, such a family member, relative or close friend. That also raises many concerns. Unfortunately, in our society this legislation is necessary. Given recent revelations it is unfortunate for many of the victims that society is only now waking up to the fact that children are vulnerable and some people who are left in a position of trust with them can abuse it. We have heard about the horrific acts that have been performed on young, innocent children. In many cases adults have been abused and tortured, both mentally and physically.</P>
    <P>Some sex offenders cannot be reformed or rehabilitated but others can be helped and treated for the betterment of society and themselves. I have read about courses of treatment that could be availed of by sex offenders and could be provided to many of those convicted and committed to prison for sex offences. Of the 80 sex offenders released last year, only five had completed the recommended rehabilitation programme. Why is this so? The 1988 figures show that only 11 of the 103 sex offenders released were treated. These figures have also been mentioned by other Deputies during the debate. Treatment levels have decreased and while such treatment for sex offenders is not obligatory, something is radically wrong if only five out of 80 opt to avail of it. The Minister should investigate <Col N="605" /> methods of improving the uptake in treatment before he proceeds with a similar treatment programme in the Curragh. It is frightening and alarming for the victims, their families and society in general to realise that very little is being done to ensure that when sex offenders are released from prison they will not re-offend. While they remain in custody every effort should be made to ensure they are rehabilitated. Treatment for sex offenders in the younger, 17 to 20 year, age group is crucially important. Research shows that the latter group responds best to treatment and has the greatest chance of reforming. Society should focus on trying to prevent crime of this nature in future.</P>
    <P>Isolating and segregating such prisoners without offering any form of treatment is an irresponsible act towards the rest of society. It represents a pathetic attitude by the State to its responsibility in this matter. When hurled together these criminals will feed on one another's fantasies, thus supporting one another and reinforcing the denial of their crimes. There is evidence that victim blame can become the norm and that these sex offenders will become heroes in their own sad little group.</P>
    <P>Sex offenders are not eligible for early release or sentence review, so many of them sit out their sentences untouched by any form of therapy. They are later released into society, in many cases with their initial mindset reinforced because of the company they kept while in prison. This could at best be described as negligence by the State because it fails to protect the community against a real and known risk. Therapy and close supervision is essential to the rehabilitation of such prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the courses available were not taken up and that there is no obligation or incentive to do so. In other countries, forcing prisoners into treatment programmes has shown to be a positive step. Experience has shown that such treatment can work, even when a prisoner is mandated to undergo it rather than volunteering to do so. In many cases, therapy in prisons is offered in group settings. The goal is to ensure that prisoners will not re-offend when released into society. Participants must gain an insight into the chain of events which trigger their abusive thoughts and behaviour and the coping mechanism in response to these thoughts. Such treatment will help the offender to develop an empathy with his victim. This is a very important part of the treatment because many offenders have no sense of their victims' feelings or predicament.</P>
    <P>The offender has a distorted thinking which can provide a behaviour rationale which justifies his offences. Statements such as &ldquo;the victim was asking for it&rdquo;, or that he or she &ldquo;was providing much needed sex education to the victim&rdquo; reveal a thinking that is endemic in the mind of a sex offender. Treatment and therapy will deal with this problem in a valuable way. The offender's response to stimuli is tested by therapists to gauge what progress has been made. In Canada, for <Col N="606" /> example, such programmes are the first step in a pre-release programme. The next step can involve closely monitored periods of temporary release and therapy in the community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that such treatment programmes will represent a cost to the State and I am concerned about the implication of the costs that will arise from implementation of the Bill when enacted. What are the implications in terms of extra gardaí, probation officers, therapists and psychologists? The Minister should explain the costs involved. It is all very well to have legislation, but what funding will there be to ensure the law is properly enforced? Funding for this legislation should be weighed against the cost of keeping an offender in prison or the cost to society of victim support services. While no price can be put on the long-term effect on victims, we should be examining the prevention of sex offences, which is the essential element of treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>When enacted, the Bill will establish a register of those convicted of sex offences against children and other serious sexual assaults. Under the legislation, judges will have discretion as to who goes on the register. The legislation will also apply to those convicted of similar sex offences outside the jurisdiction. Ireland can no longer be seen as a safe haven for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step forward in the fight against sex crimes and protecting vulnerable children. It will act as a deterrent to all would-be offenders. The offender must, either by personally attending a Garda station or by written notice, notify his or her name and address to the Garda Síochána within ten days of becoming subject to the legislation as well as within ten days of changing address or if he or she should leave the State for ten days or more. Access to this information is restricted to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about how exactly community groups, voluntary organisations, sports clubs and schools will be informed if they have a volunteer or an applicant for a job who is on the sex offenders' register. Will they be notified at the discretion of the Garda Síochána? Will the procedure vary from person to person, or will it depend on the area or jurisdiction? The success of the register system will depend on the vigilance of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister's speech that the onus will be on the convicted offender to notify potential employers, but if we are depending on that to happen we are heading in the wrong direction. Some stronger measure is required to ensure that groups who may avail of the services of such offenders will be notified that they are on the register. Recently, I spoke to a number of people involved in child care in my constituency who are concerned about the situation and would like to have access to such a register of sex offenders. I am not saying they should have direct access but they should have some way of knowing whether the people they are using to mind their children, whether as crèche supervisor <Col N="607" /> or child minder, can be trusted. Individuals may have the necessary credentials for working with children but I am concerned about others who have access to play groups or people's homes. At present there is no way of obtaining information on such people, or access to the person who is in charge. That needs to be examined. There is no register. There is no way of informing oneself of the credentials of the person employed there.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Bill proposes that there should be certain access to the register and that it shall be confined to the Garda Síochána. Information contained in the register shall not be disclosed to any other person save with the permission of a High Court judge on the application of a member of the Garda not below the rank of inspector. Such an application, which must be heard <i>in camera,</i> shall not be granted unless in the opinion of the judge it is in the interests of public safety to do so. The judge who grants an application shall specify in his or her order the extent to which the disclosure is to be permitted. The access that voluntary organisations or people who are working with children will have to the register is an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not an answer to all our problems on the issue of sexual offences. It is important to educate children, and this has been mentioned already in the debate, to equip themselves to deal with such situations and to recognise when they are in danger. The stay safe and relationships and sexuality programmes in our schools are valuable but I am concerned that they will be undermined locally in the schools. I am aware of one case where the parents were not happy because they did not want their children to be exposed to such a programme. I respect their views and that they are responsible for their children but if even one child can put his or her hand up in school and say that he or she can now say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because of this programme, it will have been 100% successful. There has been a lot of opposition in some schools among parents and some teachers are not comfortable with the course. They have sought some changes in the programme. I am aware that in one school the parents decided that they would remove the video section of the course, which totally undermined its value. The use of video is important because visual messages are a necessary way of imparting information to children, yet the programme in that school was interfered with. That should not have happened. I look forward to the introduction of the new RSE course. I attended an introductory meeting on the course and it is valuable in equipping children to deal with daily incidents in which they find themselves. The programme is another important prong in dealing with sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendations in regard to rape victims. They are important and have been sought for a long time by those involved in the area. Victims of rape will now have advice and assistance from a legal expert. Rape victims often <Col N="608" /> find the atmosphere in courtrooms very intimidating and they need this protection. That is the reason many cases of rape have not been reported. In many instances the victim does not get representation or any support in the courtroom. The recommendations in the Bill are an important part of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill which I am sure will be widely welcomed by all decent people. Dealing with the problem of child abusers, otherwise known as paedophiles, has caused a lot of soul-searching for a long time and frustration over the manner in which the State has been unable to deal with these people. When I read in the Bill that these offenders will not be able to work anywhere near children unsupervised I got a little worried. They should not be allowed to work anywhere near children, supervised or unsupervised. A few years ago a constituent of mine discovered, quite by accident, that her seven year old child was being abused by a man working in the school she attended. When the man was arrested and brought before the courts, it was discovered that he had committed a list of offences in Britain. I was appalled at the time that people like that could get jobs in schools. It is vitally important that we monitor these people at all times but I would not let them near schools, supervised or unsupervised. They should be kept away from the areas where children assemble. We hear about rehabilitation programmes for these people but as far as I am aware they do not work, or they work in very few cases &ndash; I do not know the percentage but I am told that they do not work in most cases. Many of these paedophiles were abused themselves as youngsters. Their lives are completely destroyed and the cycle continues.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, when I was a member of the Eastern Health Board, a psychiatrist told me about a problem he had which involved a patient who had gone to him for advice because he was a paedophile. He told the psychiatrist that he had an irresistible urge to kill, and he was looking for help to do something about that urge. The psychiatrist told me that because of the patient confidentiality rule, he was extremely worried. He happened to meet a friend of his who was a High Court judge and he asked him if there was anything he could do. The High Court judge told him there was nothing he could do other than speak to the local Garda superintendent in the area where the man lived, but the psychiatrist had already spoken to the superintendent who told him that, unfortunately, the law was such that he could not intervene unless the man committed a crime. This man was an unexploded bomb whom the psychiatrist was aware of but he could not commit him as a potential danger because a court would not have allowed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the sentences vary for first and second time offenders but where a person offends three times, that person should be put away for life. Young children cannot be allowed to be put <Col N="609" /> at risk from people who cannot be cured of their offending nature.</P>
    <P>We often talk about the terrible acts these people commit but we rarely reflect on the terror of their victims. Victims often have a sense of guilt about what happened to them. We know from recent history that when children told their parents of incidences that happened, the parents sometimes slapped them for saying such terrible things about the person about whom they were complaining. They just could not believe it. Parents now know they should listen to their children if they complain of being abused in some way, without going into any detail.</P>
    <P>While we are trying to batten down the hatches here on this problem, there has been a relaxing of the censorship laws in the UK relating to pornographic material. I listened to a discussion on this matter on Radio 5 this morning. The availability of extreme pornography does not help us tackle the problem and plays into the hands of these awful people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislative programme being introduced by the Minister. I hope sentences will be severe enough to deter. A psychiatrist who is satisfied a person will offend again should have powers to detain him. It is important our children are protected from the terror inflicted by these terrible people. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on the legislation he has introduced so far in the 28th Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and his officials on this groundbreaking legislation which is a testimony to their productivity. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under the Minister's leadership, has put an unprecedented volume of legislation through the Oireachtas in the life of this Government, which is welcome. The Bill is part of a major package of reforms designed to protect the public from sex offenders. It is a wide-ranging set of measures and the Minister has promised more legislation to make the law in this area as comprehensive as possible in the way it gives protection to children and the weak and vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>There are five main elements in the Bill. There will be a new notification procedure and tracking system for all convicted offenders. This requirement will also apply to sex offenders who enter the country from abroad. The civil sex offenders order will implement a new system of post-release supervision of sex offenders. There will be new requirements for sex offenders who seek employment where unsupervised access to children is involved, to which Deputy Briscoe referred. Separate legal representation in rape and other serious sexual assault cases will be available in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new notification procedures. We need a system to keep track of convicted sex offenders who are clearly a menace to the young and vulnerable in our society. There have been many recent examples of crimes committed by <Col N="610" /> such people. The apprehension and conviction of sex offenders does not end the problem, even when custodial sentences are imposed and rehabilitative counselling provided. It is clear from research in many countries that there is a very high probability of offenders committing further crimes, as Deputy Briscoe said. The public must be given the best possible guarantees and safeguards against this when offenders are released back into our communities.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, security is impossible to guarantee but measures in the Bill which, to all intents and purposes, place legitimate restrictions on the freedom of people who have demonstrated, through their actions and behaviour, that they constitute a continuing threat and menace to society, go a long way towards reassuring parents and vulnerable people that the State will do everything in its power to protect them from offenders whose crimes can have a deep and traumatic psychological effect on their victims' lives.</P>
    <P>The requirement for sex offenders to register with the gardaí, either on conviction or release from prison and to notify them of any subsequent change in name or address, will enable the authorities to keep track of these offenders and continually assess their risk to others. Offenders who receive a custodial sentence of two years or more will have a notification requirement. The penalties for non-compliance are stiff &ndash; a fine and up to one year imprisonment or both &ndash; and are necessary to continue placing unrelenting pressure on these predatory people. There is no doubt they are menace to society. If anyone offended against any member of our families, naturally we would be very upset. If a person offended against one of my family, I would go to the ends of the earth to ensure he got the punishment he deserved. I support the Minister's tough stance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the civil sex offenders order under which the gardaí will be able to apply to the civil courts for a retaining order for persons who, while their behaviour is not criminal, give reasonable grounds to believe they may cause harm to the public. For example, they can be banned from loitering at school playgrounds without a legitimate reason. This is typical behaviour of sex offenders who loiter at playgrounds, swimming pools and places where young people frequent to prey on them. The provisions on post-release supervision will enable the courts to fix a determined sentence, the latter part of which will be served in the community under the close supervision of the probation and welfare service and health boards. The combined custodial and non-custodial elements will not exceed the maximum custodial sentence available in respect of the crime. This provision should be used in such a way that the offender is obliged to make some form of restitution, either directly or indirectly, to the victim or the community.</P>
    <P>Sex offenders and employment is a contentious area. I welcome the creation of an offence covering the failure of a convicted sex offender, when <Col N="611" /> looking for or accepting work, to notify the employer of the fact that he or she has a criminal record for sex offences. It is important for an employer to know a person has committed sex offences. This provision is designed to act as a deterrent to unsuitable persons who might use the workplace to gain access to children for their nefarious purposes. Many offenders become involved in childminding, coaching and areas such as this. It is important these people are identified and can be told they are not welcome if they have committed offences elsewhere. Relationships based on trust or fear are commonplace but children are entitled to be protected from those with known perverted tendencies who might prey on them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases where applications are made to produce evidence or to cross-examine them about their past sexual experiences. I also welcome the provision which imposes an obligation on those convicted of sex offences to make this known to potential employers.</P>
    <P>Court proceedings are difficult and stressful for ordinary citizens but they are doubly so for the victims of sexual crime. Those people need every possible assistance and support from society and this measure goes some way to offering them some comfort. I am glad the Minister is introducing such necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises that those who commit sexual offences, which often have a damaging effect on the lives of their victims, must have their civil rights circumscribed in the interests of the common good. Civil society and social order is based on mutual respect for human rights, duties and obligations. Sexual offences and those who commit them are particularly repellent and reprehensible. Such offences destroy the personal integrity of the victim and his or her feelings of security and well-being. Those who commit such crimes cannot expect the normal freedoms to which every citizen is entitled. The potential for re-offending exists and society demands to be protected from it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister and his officials for the work they put into it. It is innovative legislation. In my constituency of Dublin North-East, I recently received representations about ten people who were involved in sex offences, including incest. The victims accuse social workers and others of not following up complaints, but it was very difficult until now to secure proof that offences had taken place. This is the best work the Minister has done and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with an issue &ndash; crimes of a sexual nature &ndash; that has long existed but is only now, as a result of shocking high profile cases in recent years, being debated more publicly. This Bill is a positive reaction to that debate. I agree with Deputies Brady and Briscoe <Col N="612" /> about the manner in which the Minister has introduced legislation.</P>
      <P>The manner in which society deals with sex offenders is complicated. The nature of the crime is such that our response must cover a number of areas and we could spend much time debating each of them &ndash; punishment, rehabilitation, deterrence and prevention are all aspects. Papers have been written on each of them but few have managed to deal comprehensively with all these aspects. In this case the Minister is dealing with one aspect of the crime. The Bill is important because it addresses how society deals with sex offenders.</P>
      <P>Before going into the detail of the Bill, I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the great progress he has made in introducing legislation. When the Minister entered office, he found a shambles in some areas. I was not in the House while the rainbow Government was in power but I kept an eye on what was going on here. The emphasis then was on PR rather than legislation. The Minister is now doing much more positive work and is producing far more legislation than any of his predecessors. I was amazed the Minister has had 26 Acts passed by the Dáil since entering office and has 15 Bills before the Houses at present, with seven further Bills being drafted, a phenomenal amount of work by any standard. It surpasses the entire output of some previous Administrations.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of all this work is that it has been carefully considered and properly drafted. That is essential if we are to avoid constant court challenges. The Minister's approach is in complete contrast to the knee-jerk reaction of the Labour Party and its Bill which is currently being debated in Private Members' time. Such actions may grab the attention of the public and give a few extra feet on the moral high ground, but it usually leads to disaster.</P>
      <P>The legislation introduced by the rainbow Administration to control expenditure at elections, an issue not unrelated to today's debate, was rushed through the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting Chairman is very methodical in her approach. I am making the point that unlike this Bill, the Private Members' Bill was rushed. I gave a very clear example, the related effort to control the amount a person could spend at election time. That legislation was <Col N="613" /> back in the House as soon as this Government entered office because every Member realised that it could not be put into operation. I compliment the Minister on his approach. The previous approach, where we had to amend legislation, led to a lack of credibility. If there is a lack of credibility in the Government and the Oireachtas, it affects us all. The Minister is to be complimented on avoiding such knee-jerk reactions. I am not suggesting that any one party has a monopoly on wisdom. There can be glitches in any Bill, but it is far less likely to happen with the Minister's careful and logical approach than with the approach being adopted by the Labour Party with its Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being discussed in the context of a continuing programme of law reform and the enactment of a wide range of legislation to improve the situation for potential victims of crime, assault and abuse. Initiatives such as the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, and the Children Bill, 1999, are part of that continuing programme. It is not much use introducing this type of legislation if provision for the means to implement it is ignored. I earlier referred to the shambles, which was commented on by both sides of the House, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, found at the end of the rainbow. It included a shortage of prison spaces, gardaí, modern equipment and technology and almost a total absence of personnel to deal with the issue of refugees and asylum seekers. The Minister has dealt with those deficiencies and still managed to introduce what must be a record raft of legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not pretended to enjoy a monopoly on wisdom. He has been willing to listen and to consider arguments for change. In line with previous speakers, I will make some proposals in that regard, which I hope he will accept and I am confident he will do so.</P>
      <P>The definition of an offender in the Bill is comprehensive. It covers persons subject to imprisonment or detention and persons subject to orders postponing sentences and non-custodial penalties such as fines, community service orders and persons placed on probation. We could spend an evening debating any one of those issues, as Members would have different views on them. Some would argue for and others against the provisions in regard to those issues.</P>
      <P>Those of us who visited prisons saw the conditions that prevail there and that sexual offenders are treated differently from other prisoners, and we are aware of the need for change. Sexual offenders have been treated as a different category. High security prisoners are treated differently from other prisoners. That situation needs to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notification requirement in respect of offenders will greatly assist gardaí in monitoring their movement and considerably alleviate the possibility that they will reoffend. That is important. My primary concern in this regard is <Col N="614" /> the protection of victims. There has been an imbalance in the approach of certain people and groups to dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The subject of persons who have been convicted of serious offences in another jurisdiction and who have come to reside here, possibly to avoid being placed on a sex offenders register in that country, has received considerable media attention. We have been openly criticised in that regard by concerned citizens and groups. I welcome the important provision in the legislation that covers persons convicted of sex offences abroad who become resident here. That is a logical and common-sense step to take. It is a matter of concern that it was not in place prior to this, but given the raft of legislation that has been introduced, everything could not be dealt with together.</P>
    <P>I urge continued and, if possible, increased co-operation between the gardaí, Interpol and other police forces internationally to ensure it is not possible for an offender to evade sanction by moving from one jurisdiction to another.</P>
    <P>Given that various categories of criminals, including paedophiles and drug dealers, co-operate on an international basis, they must be taken on by the law agencies on that basis. The recent seminar in Dublin was part of an ongoing programme in that regard. It is to be welcomed, but we must also work to ensure gardaí can co-operate at international level and provide for that in terms of staffing requirements, training and other needs.</P>
    <P>It is a few years since I attended a meeting of ECAD, Europe Cities Against Drugs, at which international police people gave perspectives and spoke about what was happening in their countries. It is only by having such meetings that Ministers will be aware of the legislation required and police forces will be aware of the improvements being made and the steps that need to be taken.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the rights of a local community in which a sex offender resides. I am sure that issue is of concern to every public representative whether they serve at local or national level. Whether a community should be directly told an offender resides in their midst or the possession of such information by the gardaí is sufficient to protect its members is a complex issue. We want to avoid unnecessary panic by the public and in so far as is possible facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders. I mentioned that the Minister is always willing to take on board concerns and suggestions. I urge him to continue to review the effectiveness of this legislation to ensure a maximum level of protection is given to allay the concerns I mentioned. This is one of the most critical aspects of this Bill and of related legislation.</P>
    <P>The cases of high profile offenders have shocked us. We could not have imagined people participating in crime, particularly of a sexual nature, against young people. Where there was talk and comment, it was thought such offences were committed abroad, but not in holy Ireland. The <Col N="615" /> incidence of such offences here is of major concern. The worst possible offence that can be imagined can be committed and for that reason we must be careful to protect the vulnerable in our community.</P>
    <P>The provision for the courts to make orders in respect of sex offenders is welcome. It was overdue and it represents a significant strengthening of the law. Where a respondent has acted in such a way as to give the courts grounds for believing an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from an offender, they will be able to impose a sanction restricting the behaviour and movement of the offender. It is imperative the courts should be able to act swiftly to implement such an order. The imposition of such sanctions should be monitored and assessed carefully to ensure we are in control of this area. The gardaí and the courts are given every facility to ensure such offenders are tracked.</P>
    <P>In the past many of us would have pleaded ignorance about the incidence of sex offences. Many of us had no idea that some of what was going on could even be thought of, but now we have no excuse. The worst examples of such offences have been highlighted. We have been made aware of what people who were pillars of society were capable of doing. Therefore, we must be wary and ensure we protect the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>While I recognise it gives rise to possible constitutional and civil liberty issues, electronic tagging of convicted sex offenders may play a considerable role in our response to dealing with sex offenders in the future. If the offender has a clinical medical condition, appropriate measures will have to be taken to deal with it and the introduction of electrical tagging of offenders will have be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>On the general question of civil liberties, I have been concerned for some time that no effort has been made to support the rights of law abiding, vulnerable citizens. There does not seem to be an established group to ensure elderly people can enjoy their liberty and life and are not marooned in their homes because of a fear of thugs who always seem to have some group willing to fight their cause and case for them. People may say that is the job of society at large, but we are all part of society. It seems there is often more concern for the offender than for the offended. Without being specific and accepting there is a great need for rehabilitative work and reforming programmes, I am concerned that at times the balance has been weighed against the victim. All of us are aware of such examples in our communities. The most blatant area of abuse in this situation is that of rape cases. I welcome the fact that at long last the Minister has included measures in this Bill to help redress that imbalance. The situation in this regard that we have tolerated up to now has been a scandal. Unlike earlier cases where people pleaded ignorant of the offences committed by paedophiles, we have no excuse. <Col N="616" /> We have tolerated what I suppose amounted to a legal abuse of victims and we have done very little to put the balance back in their favour or even ensure the situation reflects a balance. I am pleased the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is taking steps in that regard.</P>
    <P>The law in respect of sex offenders taking up employment where they had unsupervised access to children or other vulnerable persons was in considerable need of updating. The Bill makes it an offence for an offender to seek employment which would bring them into possible unsupervised contact with children without first informing their prospective employer of their record. I would go further and legislate to exclude the possibility of a person on the offender's register from seeking or obtaining employment in such a capacity. The names of persons will not be put on a sex offender's list unless they have committed a serious offence. Medical practitioners and others say the likelihood of reoffending is extremely high. I ask the Minister to consider defining a number of categories of employment which would be effectively excluded from those on the offender's register.</P>
    <P>I concur with my party colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, who suggested that the definition of persons with whom offenders should not have contact through their employment be increased to include the elderly, handicapped and other potentially vulnerable persons.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to consider the question of post-release supervision and rehabilitation of offenders. I welcome the provision for the sanction of post-release supervision of sex offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>I would welcome data from the Minister relating to the current provision of both pre and post-release counselling of offenders. I am not a psychiatrist and cannot estimate the effectiveness of such counselling and other measures to discourage reoffending, but I would hazard a guess that money spent in this area is money well spent in protecting the wider community, particularly the young and the elderly.</P>
    <P>We all wish we could live in a society free of such awful crimes as are being considered in debating the Bill. However, we must be conscious of the reality. The Bill is a significant updating of the law and provides new and welcome safeguards for the community. I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated by the Minister, the Bill is tough and uncompromising, and he makes no apologies for that. I support his position, particularly when the offence is perpetrated against children. I am pleased the notification requirement is necessary in respect of all offences perpetrated against children. Crimes against children are the most reprehensible and the most damaging. Survivors of abuse will relate stories of young lives that have been destroyed. Because of my involvement with a group in my constituency, I have had the experience of listening to those <Col N="617" /> stories. Those people speak of enormous psychological damage and relate harrowing stories of how their young adult lives were destroyed. It is not always the end of a life and it need not be a life sentence. If given proper support and resources, those who have suffered can regain control of their lives and do well.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this legislation came about, directly or indirectly, as a result of a discussion paper which he published in May 1999 on the law on sexual offences. I availed of the opportunity to make a submission on that discussion paper specifically in relation to the need for separate legal representation for victims of rape. My position would have been the same as that of previous submissions from the Rape Crisis Centre. That the Bill is introducing, in Part 6, separate legal representation for complainants is welcome. However, I am disappointed it does not extend to full legal representation for victims of rape. Rape is something which is done to a person. The person is not a willing participant. I think more victims will take their case to court because of the availability of separate legal representation. When the victims get to court they feel they are not participants. Legally they are only witnesses in their own cases.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission reported it had doubts about the constitutional difficulties in affording separate legal representation. I think it has something to do with double jeopardy. The Acting Chairman and I are members of the Constitution review group. When the Minister has had an opportunity to assess how the legislation is working, it may be worth revisiting this matter in the context of constitutional change. I would welcome the fact that a woman going into court would have full legal representation. That it is being afforded to a person whose past sexual history is being examined is worthwhile but I would have liked full legal representation.</P>
      <P>I am aware from my experience with people who have had to go to court on cases such as this that the Garda Síochána has a liaison type arrangement with victims not only in rape cases. Victims have fulsome praise for the Garda. I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for the way in which this arrangement is working. I do not know if the arrangement has any statutory standing and, if not, perhaps it can be formalised. Where it is in place it is working well.</P>
      <P>The notification requirement for registration of sex offenders is welcome. It is worth noting that the civil libertarians have not complained about this. It is vital that the Garda and the community are aware if sex offenders are residing in their communities. The new tracking system for convicted sex offenders will have the effect of reducing the number of crimes of reoffending and thus contribute to rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to inform a prospective employer of a conviction is welcome. When the Equal Opportunities Bill was going through the Seanad, as a member of that House at the time I expressed concern that those convicted of sexual <Col N="618" /> offences would use it as a means of gaining employment and would not be prevented from working in certain areas. I welcome the fact that the Minister has addressed that issue. Paedophiles will seek out employment in areas where they have unsupervised access to children or any kind of access to young people. They seek out the vulnerable in society. Following the enactment of this Bill it will be an offence not to inform a prospective employer of a conviction. The legislation cannot be implemented retrospectively, but communities had concerns about people hanging around areas whom they suspected might behave in a way that was dangerous to young people. The Garda response, understandably, was that the person concerned had done nothing wrong and, therefore, could not be charged with any offence. The new civil order is extremely innovative and will give powers to the Garda to watch people who are seen loitering in the vicinity of schools and take action against them. I welcome that measure.</P>
    <P>Other speakers raised the small number of offenders who seek treatment. I also have concerns about this and it has been suggested that it is due to a lack of places on treatment programmes. I do not know if that is true but if it is the case, there is a need to put additional resources into that area. I welcome the strong provisions in the Bill but there is a need to ensure that programmes are in place which will help people not to reoffend. Serious sanctions and penalties should be imposed on people who offend, but we must also ensure that places are available for people who seek treatment.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned visiting offenders in Arbour Hill Prison. I also had occasion to visit the prison on behalf of a wife whose husband had been accused of rape. The prison officers in Arbour Hill asked to speak to me afterwards. The accused man told me he had not committed the crime, that the sex was consensual and that there was no question of rape. However, the prison officer who spoke to me said that was not unusual. Some 80% or 90% of those who commit sexual offences state categorically and on oath that they did not commit the crime and the sex was consensual. If one considers that figure, it is not surprising that only a small number seek treatment because, in the main, they are in denial. This aspect is addressed in the Bill in that the court, in addition to the supervision requirement, has the right to require an offender to attend psychological counselling and other treatment programmes. This provision should be used as often as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister on introducing it. As he said, it is another part of a raft of legislation he has brought forward in this area. The Bill is long overdue and if it had been in place previously, perhaps there would be one fewer victim. However, I hope its enactment will ensure there will be fewer victims of these heinous crimes in the future.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill, which is long overdue. That is easy to say, but it probably took some time to put the legislation together and incorporate all the submissions made to the Department by individuals and various groups and organisations which insisted that some action be taken in this area.</P>
      <P>The contributions so far have highlighted the positive point that the Bill addresses the public's demand for such legislation. In terms of the number of sexual abuse cases that have been reported and the number of abusers involved, everybody was taken aback by the scale of the offences which took place over a long period. I welcome various aspects of the Bill, particularly the fact that a register of offenders will be compiled. I appreciate the legislation cannot be implemented retrospectively and that it will only deal with future cases, but there must be some method of ensuring that information available in the UK, Northern Ireland and other European countries where such legislation already exists is made available to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda Síochána through some policing mechanism. This would ensure that background details or a profile can be built up of people who have been involved in sexual abuse in other countries.</P>
      <P>I am sure sufficient information is available in the Garda network which would form the basis of a list. This would provide information and details of people who were convicted in the past or who may be under suspicion. This information could form the basis of a list which would be used nationally and internationally. I urge the Minister to ensure in enacting the Bill that this type of information is included. Although the legislation will deal with future cases, the public outcry relates to all sex offences that have taken place in this country to date. We owe it to the many families who have been affected by such offences to provide some reference for the Garda through such lists of offenders.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a case where an offender from the UK travelled to Ireland, settled in my constituency and continued to offend there. As a result, great trauma, sadness and disruption was visited on a number of families in my county. The offender moved from there to another location and continued to offend. As we know from various reports, given the nature of these offences and the psychological make-up of the people involved, individuals continue to offend. It is essential, therefore, that there is some reference to the historical events behind this Bill. We owe this to the families of those affected to date. I ask the Minister to consider some mechanism outside the legislation which would include previous offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the register and other issues mean some form of financial provision must be made in relation to the operation of the Bill. Much positive legislation in the justice area <Col N="620" />&ndash; I commend the Minister on his activities in that regard &ndash; has been passed by the Oireachtas to date. However, there must be a framework for extending and financing the administration of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I have given this issue as much thought as anyone else and I have come to the conclusion that, if trust in politicians is ever to be regained and politics is ever again to be regarded by the public as a public service, politicians should move as quickly as possible to remove themselves from the handling of money as far as it is statutorily possible to do so. This would mean banning donations to individuals from whatever source. There are those who view this as an overreaction to current scandals, who regard it as a Dublin issue and maintain that these circumstances could not pertain outside Dublin. They could pertain outside Dublin, and every Deputy and councillor is vulnerable to the accusation that they favoured or will favour someone who at one time gave them an election donation. Ireland is too small for it to be possible to go through a career in politics and not be party at some stage to a decision which favoured a person who gave an election donation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the majority of such subscriptions are given by friends and well-wishers with no benefit being sought, expected or given, and that they are received in the same spirit. In other words, they are regarded by both receiver and giver as legitimate election donations. However, from now on in the minds of the public, there is no such thing as a legitimate election donation to a candidate. Whatever the spirit in which the money was given or received, in the minds of the public, it is tainted. From now on, the motivation for giving or receiving donations will be assumed to be corrupt. That is the assumption, however unfair, and the best we can hope for is that it will be believed that we are compromised at a subliminal level in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way now to protect the body politic is to remove the conditions whereby such a situation can arise. We should go further and take ourselves completely out of the money equation, be it the receiving of money, either for personal or <Col N="623" /> party donations, or the distribution of donations which I will discuss later. At present, every Deputy receives some type of political contribution at election time, but they are also expected by their parties to fundraise for their local organisation, their constituency, their party headquarters, local and general elections, referenda, presidential elections and by-elections. With lunches, seminars, golf classics and quizzes, we are literally on an endless treadmill of ticket sales. We are nothing better than ticket touts. It is not just a distraction from what we should be about, which it certainly is, it is also embarrassing, distasteful and potentially compromising. It is time we got ourselves off that hook.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, and I know all politicians will be pleased, that from the next general election there will be a cap on spending. It will certainly reduce the pressure on all candidates and reduce dependence on donations. In multi-seat constituencies, Deputies compete not only at elections but between them in the donations they give to clubs and organisations and countless other groups which are all worthy and to which we should contribute privately. However, we contribute publicly in the size of the donations we give, the glossiness of the advertisements we take out and the extent of our sponsorship. In other words, we are trying to buy the goodwill of the public and are trying to be judged by the extent of our largesse. That is not how it should be and it is an unhealthy pressure on politicians. There is not the same demand publicly for an end to this, but it is the flip side of the donation coin and it is something we should take on board on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Some will remember in my first election in this jurisdiction in 1989 the widely reported comments I made on the widespread cynicism among the electorate of Dublin West. I said I was appalled at the cynicism about politicians and the political process and that this cynicism was a greater threat to our political institutions than was the gun and the bomb to the political institutions north of the Border. It now transpires that not even the most cynical could have suspected one tenth of what was going on. What has been disclosed so far indicates a level of corruption in planning matters comparable to what we are told occurs in a so-called banana republic. I did not exaggerate when I underlined the threat to our political institutions represented by such widespread cynicism. The fact that the cynics have now been proved to be correct makes the position even worse. What it means for the future is that the honesty and integrity of our public representatives cannot be taken for granted. Due to the corruption of a small number of people, the rest of us will have to prove our honesty and go beyond what would normally be expected in terms of transparency to regain the trust which ought to be the norm in a democratic society. It will take some time to regain that trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> A good beginning should be the rooting out and removal of those in whatever party, if any, who have abused the trust of the people and their political colleagues. There should be the strictest possible limits on election expenditure. I know this will be difficult to enforce and ways around it will be found, but the worst and most blatant excesses will not happen for fear of losing the seat. What happened in my constituency in the past, where there were queues of taxis outside polling stations and bags of coal delivered to the elderly, should not happen in future. We must look to the future. The current scandal over planning must ultimately have a good effect. The barefaced development-driven decisions of the past should be made impossible, especially in my constituency where the threat to Laraghcon and St. Edmondsbury should be lessened. We are told that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance; so is the price of democracy.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party's attitude to the funding of political parties is not only cynical but also opportunistic, given that its track record of receiving union and corporate donations poses a litany of questions which continue to go unanswered by its leader, Deputy Quinn. He has a selective memory where the methods used by the Labour Party to line its coffers and balance its books are concerned. He has submerged himself and his party in a sea of confusion in his clamour to take the high moral ground on an issue which now brings into question the Labour Party's commitment to transparency under Deputy Quinn. He makes no apology for his party continually returning to what it themes the corrosive and destructive effect on the political process of its reliance on private sources to fund its activities. His shallow reflection on the past reduces his claims of aversion to corporate donations to a gross act of cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's view of political donations being corrosive and destructive flies in the face of the fact that the largest recipient of political donations in 1997 was none other than Deputy Quinn who amassed a staggering £27,000. What credence does this give to the Labour Party's call for a £1,000 ceiling on donations to individual politicians? In a more recent statement, Deputy Quinn traced the Labour Party's opposition to political donations as far back as 1991. This <Col N="625" /> assertion is in stark contrast to the reality of the party's ongoing fundraising operations. The Labour Party calls for a £2,000 limit to the amount which can be donated to any political party. Contrary to its view of the potential for corrosive and destructive effects, the same Deputy Quinn had no qualms during the 1997 general election in accepting five times this amount on behalf of his party.</P>
    <P>A myriad of questions surround the Labour Party's link to trade unions and the funding it receives from this source. It has accepted a sizeable level of support from corporate Ireland. In 1997 and 1998 the Labour Party received a total of £78,841. This included £27,741 from SIPTU, which excludes support given to individual members, and £23,100 from former MEP, Bernie Malone, in the form of levies. Of significant interest is the fact that over this period SIPTU, the country's largest trade union, is ranked fourth in the league table of donations, with £52,961 given to the Labour Party and its Oireachtas Members. The Public Offices Commission donations for 1999 revealed that a further £38,721 was given to Labour from SIPTU, so the time has come for Labour to clarify its position in this respect. It should state clearly and unequivocally whether it is prepared to forego the amount it received from this source.</P>

      <P>It should state clearly and unequivocally whether it is prepared to forego the amount it received from this source. The £20,000 in trade union donations recently referred to by Deputy Quinn falls well short of that detail on the public record. Payments in excess of £30,000 have been recorded for each of the past four years. Perhaps Deputy Quinn will explain the anomaly between the two amounts. I for one would like to hear, in the interests of transparency, what is the precise position.</P>

      <P>A clear and detailed account of the additional thousands of pounds in donations received by Labour Party Members would be welcome at this point in the debate on political funding. A similar account of benefits in kind such as office accommodation made available by the party should be on the public record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that Labour's record on transparency is not as squeaky clean as it would wish us to believe. As recently as last year Labour was forced to admit it had received a donation of £30,000 from its then MEP, Bernie Malone, and failed to honour its legal obligations to inform the Public Offices Commission of this donation. Remarkably, the donation from its own MEP was almost eight times greater than the size of donations that must be legally disclosed to the <Col N="626" /> Public Offices Commission, yet Labour stands proud as the guardians of openness, transparency and accountability. Labour's attitude to transparency is also open to debate when one considers its attitude to tax clearance certificates, an issue my party has comprehensively addressed with the introduction of our code of conduct.</P>
    <P>At the Labour Party conference of 1997 a motion was put proposing an amendment to the electoral Bill providing that all candidates for elected public office submit, with their nomination papers, a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners. If this motion was passed why, three years later, has Labour failed to implement it? If the motion was rejected, what does that say about Labour's commitment to openness, transparency and accountability?</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the erosion of Labour's commitment to the same ideals lies with Deputy Quinn's failure to adequately explain his professed lack of knowledge of the Woodchester loan and subsequent write-off of £28,000 at the time of the 1994 European elections, despite the fact that he was Labour's director of elections in Dublin and deputy party leader at the time. Deputy Quinn recently said in the House that the Labour Party believes that we in the House have a duty to ensure that the whole truth, however unpalatable, is laid bare and that we have a responsibility to deal with the difficult questions the truth sometimes turns up. I am afraid this statement contrasts starkly with his refusal to make a definitive statement on the Woodchester Bank issue in the face of repeated calls to do so. He has rejected the need for an inquiry into how the debt and donation were treated in the Labour Party's accounts, while Senator Costello's call for a party inquiry was also shot down.</P>
    <P>It appears that some Members have selective memories when it comes to methods used by their parties to bolster finances. I am not for one moment suggesting any dishonesty on behalf of any individual&mdash;</P>

That is surely a reasonable stance for any member of the public or member of a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party speak about this matter, they should engage in deep political soul-searching at the same time before proposing cure-all solutions to an issue this Government has moved decisively to address. The work involved in such an undertaking would <Col N="627" /> allow a timeframe to put an all-encompassing strategy to tackle corruption and wrongdoing in public life and restore credibility and confidence in the body politic.</P>
    <P>It seems that while Deputy Quinn may wish to paint his party as a forest of palms, there is little question but that it sprouts olives. Down through the history of the State donations have not just been made to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and other parties but also to the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The fundamental basis to all government, whether it be at national or local level, is trust. Those of us who serve in the three branches of government &ndash; the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary &ndash; hold our positions in trust from the people. For a Member of this House, or of any other elected forum, or for a Minister or official to decide on a matter on the basis that it will benefit him or her is to betray the people's trust. The bottom line is that we have an absolute obligation to make our decisions solely on the basis of what is in the best interests of the people.</P>
      <P>In the wake of revelations at current tribunals and at the McCracken Tribunal, it is not going too far to say that public trust in politicians and the political system has been seriously damaged. We face an historic challenge to restore that trust which is essential to the successful working of democracy and politics in our country and, indeed, to the continued well-being of our nation.</P>
      <P>The Government's amendment seeks to have an integrated approach across these fronts through the mechanism of an all-party committee tasked to report no later than the end of September. Recent events have given added momentum to the reform process. However, it is important that we progress the reform agenda with due care because the fundamental nature of the issues means that the decisions arrived at will determine the future well-being of our democracy. We cannot afford the luxury of rushed provisions and it is the Government's view that an all-party approach offers the best chance of achieving good, properly considered legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, already provides mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest in relation to Members of the Houses, Ministers and officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service. The ethics legislation had been in place for less than two years when Justice McCracken wrote his report and while he looked <Col N="628" /> forward to that legislation being highly effective, he nonetheless made recommendations for improvements. These recommendations included provisions for an independent third party to monitor and investigate possible contraventions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, for the requirement that any candidate going forward for election to either House of the Oireachtas must produce a tax clearance certificate, for a statutory declaration from the person that his or her tax affairs are in order and for the making of a false declaration of interest under the Act to be a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The Government published proposals in 1998 to implement the recommendations of the McCracken Tribunal and following resolutions in both Houses, these were carefully considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Select Committees on Members' Interests in each House.</P>
    <P>While the Government has yet to finalise its consideration of the Standards in Public Office Bill, I wish to outline some of the key provisions currently being drafted for inclusion in the Bill. It will provide for the establishment of a new Standards in Public Office Commission to investigate complaints involving office holders, Members of the Oireachtas and various public servants. This commission would also take on the role of the existing Public Offices Commission in relation to the ethics and electoral Acts.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the time of the publication of the McCracken report, the Government feels it is necessary that the new commission be headed by a judge or former judge of the High Court or Supreme Court. This approach was endorsed by the Constitution review committee and an all-party committee which recommended a single ethics and electoral commission comprising a serving or former Supreme Court or High Court judge as chair. It is the Government's intention that the Standards in Public Office Commission will have powers similar to those of a tribunal. We have seen in recent weeks how effective these powers can be in getting to the truth of important issues of public confidence in politics.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the commission will not be confined to investigating breaches of the ethics Act but will have a wider power to consider significant allegations of financial irregularities on the part of Members, office holders and various public servants. Clearly, the investigative powers of the commission will be a substantial and credible deterrent to potential wrongdoers and will underpin public confidence in the probity of our political and administrative system.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill will also create tax clearance requirements for politicians, senior public servants and judges. Basically, this would mean that each Member would have to make a statutory declaration stating that his or her tax affairs were in order and produce a tax clearance certificate. The Government is also providing that senior public servants and judges will be required to provide a tax clearance certifi<Col N="629" /> cate. The Dáil Select Committee and the Joint Committee advocated a code of conduct for all persons in public life. The Standards in Public Office Bill will accordingly provide for drawing up a code of conduct by the new Standards in Public Office Commission to apply to Ministers and other office holders. The select committees will perform a similar role in respect of Members of the Houses. The Bill will also provide that codes of conduct applicable to public servants will be incorporated in the terms and conditions of employment or office of a staff member or special adviser or director as the case may be. These codes will aim to promote the highest standards and confidence in public life by providing guidance on appropriate behaviour in such areas as use of influence and conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>In line with the views of the Oireachtas committees, the Government does not propose to create a statutory prohibition on persons found guilty of an offence under the ethics Act from becoming a Member of either House. The Government is advised that such a provision would be highly vulnerable to a successful constitutional challenge. A similar prohibition does not apply to persons convicted of far more serious offences such as murder, rape or substantial fraud. This does not mean there would not be a penalty for such breaches, rather that the power to discipline Members, including suspending them, would rest with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Constitution. Deputy Quinn in his contribution last night said &ldquo;Constitutionality has arisen at each and every stage of the campaign to clean up politics and has been raised as an obstacle at every stage of the reform process.&rdquo;  The Government is not using the Constitution to put obstacles in the way of making progress on these issues. The Constitution exists to provide a proper balance of rights and obligations for citizens and their elected representatives. No dutiful Government can ignore important issues of constitutional law in designing legislation, just as no court would ignore these issues in deciding whether legislation is constitutionally valid.</P>
    <P>The committees which examined the Government's proposals on standards in public office identified a range of adjustments to the Ethics in Public Office Act which would be necessary to address technical and implementation issues. I am particularly anxious to ensure the administrative burden on Members arising from the ethics and electoral Acts is streamlined to the greatest extent possible and this will be achieved through measures such as aligning the periods covered by donations and interests disclosure statements required under these Acts.</P>
    <P>We have heard in the past that not enough use is made of Oireachtas committees. Very often when the Government mentions it is considering an issue we are told the matter should be referred to a committee so that complex issues can benefit from the undoubted expertise and breadth of experience of Oireachtas Members. That is pre<Col N="630" /> cisely what the Government is now proposing, but it is also proposing that the committee concerned would operate to a tight deadline, and that the Government would pledge itself to a swift and comprehensive response to the committee's deliberations. This seems to me to be the best course of action.</P>

      <P>The revelations at the Flood tribunal have occupied the front pages of our newspapers in recent weeks. I realise the seriousness of these recent revelations. However, the media has painted these revelations as a matter of great surprise. It is with certain regret that I say the public is not as shocked as we are led to believe. The revelations reinforce the perception that many of the electorate have of politicians in general. The revelations are serious and pose a very serious threat to democracy. There is no place for corruption or wrongdoing in politics. However, it is important that we deal with the matter in a mature manner, something which has not been evident in this Private Members' debate.</P>

      <P>As a Member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party I am very anxious that the proper action is taken, something I will ensure is done. Nobody has been dragged into the House &ndash; I volunteered to come to contribute and will speak my own mind on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is important that we do not take action solely for the purpose of appeasing the public. A quick fix, rushed job is in no one's interest and could possibly do more damage in the long-term as such an approach could be expected to be inadequate and short of the measures which should be considered and implemented. There is enough wisdom on all sides in the House to put in place a strategic approach to repairing the damage to the body politic and to restoring confidence in politics in the interest of those we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Labour Party has invested considerable energy and time in producing the Private Members' Bill. That said, surely a more constructive approach to tackling this issue would be to dispense with the quick fix and rushed approach and to adopt an all-party approach to <Col N="631" /> definitely and comprehensively put in place the structures and legislation required to root out corruption and restore faith in politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that this is a very important debate, one of the reasons for which is that public confidence in politicians and the political process has been declining. We cannot blame the electorate for the increasing cynicism. A minority of people in elected office have given the majority of honest politicians a bad name, but we must accept the reality that a few bad apples can damage the entire barrel, and that is where we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>Elected politicians have a primary role in restoring public confidence in the political system. We acknowledge the tribunals have important work to do, but nevertheless we as politicians have a clear role to fulfil in our own right. The essence of democracy is that elected representatives represent the people. The role of the citizen and the voter must have pre-eminence. When people vote in elections their decision must be respected and there should not be a hidden influence in the political system.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding for political parties. Last year alone more than £3 million was made available by the Exchequer to the various political parties and Independents in the House. More than £2 million was made available through the party leaders' allowance scheme, and under the Electoral Act more than £1 million was paid directly to political parties, figures which may not be widely known. Given that the Exchequer has gone a long way down the road towards subventing the political system the time has come to complete the process. It would take an estimated £4 million, giving a total expenditure of approximately £7 million, to fully finance the political operation of all parties and Independents. If we have public funding the legislation must provide for new candidates, candidates who fail to get elected and new political parties. If no such mechanism exists the legislation will be biased in favour of existing political parties.</P>
      <P>It is well known that in the past I have proposed a ban on corporate and business donations to political parties, restrictions on donations from individuals to politicians and parties and full public accountability and an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General each year, with the accounts laid before the House. There should also be sensible expenditure limits.</P>

It <Col N="632" /> was an all-party committee and I had to make a private addendum to the report because I was unable to get all-party agreement for those basic proposals. I hope before the year is out we will have consensus in the House.</P>

I appeal to the Opposition to agree that it is better to get it right than get it quick. This issue will not be put on the long finger and I am satisfied that this legislation will be on the Statute Book in the months ahead, well in advance of the next general election, so that we can meet the electorate with our hands on our hearts and say that we have done our bit to restore the good image of politics. I look forward to a robust debate on this matter. There is not unanimous agreement within the parties or between them and it will take a great deal of work to reach a conclusion. If all of us work together we can do a good job in the interests of politicians and democracy in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>The stated intent of the Bill is to ban corporate donations to political parties. I support that intent. However, I cannot support the means proposed to achieve it. The core of the Bill is the provision to restrict donations to those from registered voters. In moving the Bill, Deputies Quinn and Gilmore made clear that one of its purposes was to ban donations from people outside Ireland. Deputy Quinn referred to &ldquo;the continued distortion in the political process caused by overseas fundraising.&rdquo;  Deputy Gilmore spoke in similar terms. Blinded by their obvious concern at the advances achieved and projected for Sinn Féin, the proposers of this legislation have apparently lost sight of their stated objective. It is supposed to target corporate donations and that is how it has been presented in the media.</P>

      <P>I totally reject the assertion that donations to Sinn Féin or any other party, including the Labour Party, which has not been so successful in this regard, by people in the US or elsewhere distort the political process. It is well known that Sinn Féin raises considerable funds in the US, Australia and elsewhere. We do so in the US under the most rigorous regulations. The Friends of Sinn Féin organisation must file a record of all moneys collected, the names and addresses of each donation of $50 or more and an account of all expenditures, including amounts remitted to Ireland with the US Justice Department every six months.</P>
      <P>This Bill would deny Irish emigrants, already denied the opportunity to vote, and members of the Irish diaspora in the US the right to contribute to the political party of their choice. These are not corporate donations. By definition, the donors cannot have any vested interest or hope of personal advantage in contributing to Sinn Féin. The vast majority of such donations are small sums from supporters of the party's peace strategy. Many are from people who had to emigrate from this country in the 1980s, young people at that time denied a future because of the gross mismanagement of the economy and endemic unemployment. It was the absence of that and previous generations of young people which, to adapt the words of Deputy Quinn, distorted the political process.</P>
      <P>Corporate funding of political parties needs to be stopped. It is scandalous that parties have been bankrolled by banks and other financial institutions and big business. Such a relationship has not just bought individual votes in council chambers, it has ensured Government policies which favour big business above all else, with banks free to fleece their customers and with the lowest corporation tax in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, however, as presented, is deeply flawed. I cannot support its central provision which confines donations to registered voters only. The absurdity of it is that my party leader could not make a contribution to my campaign at the next general election. It is absolutely ludicrous. The legislation needs to be reshaped. The commitment in the Government amendment to comprehensively address the issue and to introduce considered legislation before the year is out is both welcome and worthy of support. Having clearly stated my support for legislation which will end the corporate funding of political parties, I look forward to the consultative process to be undertaken by the as yet to be appointed all-party committee, the report of which will be available by 30 September. We will then have the opportunity to examine fully comprehensive legislation, hopefully, through the efforts of all parties in this House, including Sinn Féin. Tonight in accord<Col N="634" /> ance with that I will support the Government amendment.</P>

      <P>The notion that the legislation is somehow rushed and six months grace is needed to refine or perfect it has no basis in fact. We have been involved in this debate for the best part of a decade. The trilogy of Bills introduced by the Labour Party &ndash; the Electoral Bill, 1997, the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, and the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1995 &ndash; were negotiated in 1992 with all the parties represented in the House. They have become the core of ethics legislation to which the Government refers in order to defend the current conduct of business. It says these Acts are the protectors of standards in public life.</P>
      <P>Some members of the Government parties fought tooth and nail against those Bills, line by line. I had the honour and privilege of steering the Electoral Bill, 1997, through the House. It was held up in committee for months on end. The Opposition was led by the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the current Attorney General, former Deputy McDowell who said that the Bill was unamendable and unworkable, so bad that he could not table amendments to it, and that he would fight it line by line instead. That is the Government's record of commitment to the electoral reform that is now required.</P>
      <P>In direct negotiations during the formation of a Government in 1993 Fianna Fáil put a proposition to the Labour Party whereby we should not enact legislation to provide for disclosure of political contributions for at least 18 months so that it could clear the backlog of indebtedness which it faced at that time The Minister for Finance is aware of that. Unfortunately the current situation, as indicated by the ongoing work of the tribunals, requires us to make some decisions in principle immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal decision must be to end once and for all the link between business and politics. We have a responsibility to do that, to defend the honourable profession of politics and to protect public confidence in the administration of the country. The Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="635" /> Law Reform's response to this legislation was typically partisan, bombastic and, as usual, empty. No concrete proposals were made. The Government amendment seeks to defer any decision for six months. The next issue before us is a simple and straightforward principle, to end the link between business and politics or to continue it, on which we will vote at 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The refinement of the proposal and criticisms of it can take place on Committee Stage, once Second Stage has been agreed. It is on that principle the people await our decisions tonight. The Labour Party does not have a high moral ground. We do not have a monopoly on integrity or ethics which are values shared largely by every Member and every party in the House. That is why we have a collective responsibility. We have all received contributions from business, individuals and, from the Labour Party's perspective, from the trade union movement. We have not ever hidden that and in fact we have published it. However, all of us who have a duty to politics have a collective responsibility to accept the motion for a Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will yet again demonstrate their complete failure to recognise the damage which has been inflicted on politics, especially over recent years. The Labour Party has presented Fianna Fáil with an opportunity to draw a line under its past. It presented that party with an opportunity to affirm the principle that the link between business and politics must be broken. Fianna Fáil has run away from this challenge. For many on this side of the House that comes as no great surprise. The report of the McCracken tribunal in the summer of 1997 exposed the hypocrisy and deception which were at the heart of former Deputy Charles Haughey's tutelage of Fianna Fáil for over a decade.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's reaction was predictable and facile. Strong words were spoken in this House when we debated the tribunal's report and the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal, but these words have not been matched by any action of consequence. Lethargy, delay and downright cowardice is the real reaction of Fianna Fáil to the unfolding evidence of malpractice and serious corruption that existed and seemingly was tolerated by many senior figures in the party for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has refused to confront this damning evidence. Instead, it has embarked on an orchestrated campaign designed to smear the entire operation of politics. Fianna Fáil, given the level of evidence related to the activities of its own members, has a vested interest in propagating the lie that &ldquo;Sure, they're all the same&rdquo;. The revelations of the past three years in particular, demand effective and strong leadership from all politicians, and from the Taoiseach especially. However, the Taoiseach has failed utterly to rise to this challenge. This week he revealed that his opinion on the principle of ending the corrosive <Col N="636" /> effect corporate donations have on politics is dictated by focus groups and opinion polls. In the most pathetic example of leading from the rear, the Taoiseach told us he did not believe there was a groundswell of popular support for State funding, and therefore it will not happen. This is the kindest possible interpretation of the Taoiseach's position and many of us would contend that there are far more sinister reasons behind his refusal to ban corporate donations. At a time when principle and leadership are needed, the Taoiseach offers us populism of the worst kind.</P>
    <P>That is why the Labour Party is deeply suspicious of the Government's proposed amendment to this Bill. On 28 May 1998, nearly two years ago, the Taoiseach made the following statement in the House during a debate on political donations:</P>
    <P>The concerns I have expressed over an appropriate ethics commission, which would be in a position to investigate allegations of this nature, make it all the more urgent to have this legislation processed as quickly as possible. The Minister for Finance intends urgently proceeding with this.</P>
    <P>Two years later we still have not had sight of the Bill. The Taoiseach who claimed personal ownership of this issue has been content to sit on his hands for over two years, abdicating responsibility for a supposedly urgent matter. I fear the same will happen with the Government amendment now before the House. We must remember that the allegations to date are probably only the tip of the iceberg as regards rezoning and land deals in general. What about allegations of bribery in relation to the whole taxi business? We must remember that Mr. Frank Dunlop was central to that also. What about Vincent Browne's allegations this morning of serious corruption in the past concerning a current senior member of Fianna Fáil? What about the much more serious allegations that have been made about the whole process of privatisation over the years and which is still ongoing? The likelihood is that these allegations, and the damage they cause, will continue until the Government has the courage to take action and break the link between business and politics once and for all.</P>

      <P>The enactment of this excellent legislation, with possible amendments, will send a clear message to an already disillusioned public that the party political system in Dáil Éireann is prepared to respond to the allegations of corruption in public life, which has been manifestly exposed at the Moriarty and Flood tribunals. A democracy should assure that all its people have an equal opportunity to make use of their abilities and aspire to public office. A political system that closes its eyes to corporate funding, which mitigates against ordinary persons in favour of wealth and influence, is anti-democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the tribunals, it has been established that a former constituency colleague of <Col N="637" /> mine was in receipt of contributions totalling £117,000 in the run up to the 1989 general election. It has been further established that he held a political slush fund to use on an ongoing basis to copperfasten two Fianna Fáil seats in the Dublin North constituency. In comparison, the cost of my successful campaign in 1989 came to £5,800. On the basis of the information now available it is a miracle that I was successful at all.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the sensational allegations of corruption in the planning process in County Dublin have been publicly acknowledged. Since I first became a member of the council in 1983, I have been suspicious of the way controversial section 4 motions and development plan rezonings were proposed, debated and ultimately voted upon at council meetings. During this period the atmosphere in the council was both strained and electric. The foyer and the small public gallery of the council was full to capacity with builders, developers and their agents, while representatives of community associations looked on. On a number of occasions I witnessed amendments to motions being drawn up by agents of developers in the public gallery and passed on to obliging councillors for submission to the council meeting.</P>
    <P>It was also a most frustrating period especially for Labour Party and other concerned councillors who sat through long meetings discussing the planning and development issues relating to the various motions. At the same time, councillors, some of whom I would describe as the core rezoning lobby, would be in Conway's awaiting a phone call to troop back into the chamber to vote through one rezoning motion after another. The obvious connection that existed between the majority of Fianna Fáil and some Fine Gael councillors was unhealthy and not in the interest of proper planning.</P>
    <P>I shared the suspicion of the general public that some TDs and councillors were in receipt of &ldquo;election contributions&rdquo;, holidays, fitted kitchens and meals in return for making millions overnight for the successful developers who were in a position of influence. Not all builders or developers were successful, however, and I wonder why.</P>
    <P>Throughout the years there have been rumours of corruption in the planning process. The current attitude of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats sends out a message to the public that corruption is acceptable. My message to the Government, the Independent Deputies and to Sinn Féin is to accept the Bill and clean up the system. If elected members are proven to be involved in corruption they should be banished from public life.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that the House &ndash; I am referring to the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; does not realise the contempt in which politicians are held today. We are lower than clampers, and one cannot get much lower than that. Any politician who refuses to accept that the political system is about to sink beneath the waves and who has not got the courage, for the sake of his country, to take the step to ban the association of big business with politics, particularly the association the Fianna Fáil Party has had with the building trade, is wrong. For years the building trade profited when Fianna Fáil was in power. What we have heard revealed today is horrifying. I was very naive, despite being 18 years in this House, and I am repulsed by what I see. I shed no tears for anybody who is caught in it. The political system, if it is to save itself, has to act in unison and ban the association of all business with the world of politics.</P>
      <P>In relation to lobbyists, words fail me. I can only describe them as political prostitutes. They should not be allowed inside this building unless they are working for charitable organisations. Ireland is a small country and nobody is denied access to the political world. We are all available to people. We have seen what lobbyists did in Italy and America and how they were involved in questions for sale in England. We have all seen the disgusting spectacle of what happened with Mr. Dunlop. Lobbyists are piranha fish circling here and they will always find weak people, men or women, who will succumb to the temptation. Jesus Christ had one out of 12, Judas Iscariot, and money and people can always be bought. We should act in unison, for once in our lives, and prevent that happening.</P>
      <P>I address my remarks, as there is no one else on that side of the House, to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who is an honest man and who had the courage to recognise the cancer that was in Fianna Fáil and took steps to absent himself from it. The association of Fianna Fáil with Taca spawned this scandal. It was the most infamous, notorious and shameful organisation ever initiated in this country.</P>

    <P>Public trust in politics and politicians is lost. It has been lost through the actions of a greedy few. To use an old phrase from the past, they are the public representatives who have taken the sup. Those who have demeaned politics to this degree and are now caught should be dealt with firmly. It is unfortunate that when an opportunity such as this Bill is presented, the Government will not take it. How can the Government reconcile its seriousness about tackling this issue with its intention to vote down the Bill? There is something wrong with that. Why did the Taoiseach ask that the Bill be postponed until next October? Is <Col N="639" /> there some ulterior motive or hidden agenda? I hope he will be brought to boot some time in the future and made take responsibility for his actions in this instance.</P>
    <P>The media have a large part to play in the position in which we now find ourselves. We can all remember the glowing tributes that were paid in the past to former Taoisigh. They were the only people who were the saviours of the arts and culture, yet they were the people who were demeaning politics and politicians. Since I became a Member of this House in 1997 there has been nothing but inquiry and tribunal week after week. My first encounter with that was when I saw the former Deputy Raphael Burke crying crocodile tears on the opposite side of the House over the contribution he and his father had made when he was the sole initiator of this crisis during the lifetime of this Government. Fianna Fáil has lost an opportunity tonight. It is not interested in rectifying the situation and bringing politics and politicians back to their rightful place.</P>

      <P>I will try to be as quick as possible. Following the all-party meeting on political donations, from which the Green Party was excluded, I did an interview in which I stated that the establishment parties were simply trying to placate an angry public. On reflection I would <Col N="640" /> revise that statement. I still think that there is much posturing taking place, but are all people really angry? It is probably worse than that. Some are angry but many are resigned, cynical, apathetic and totally alienated from our political process. They believe politics is not relevant to them and their daily lives. They know instinctively that the corporately controlled world of politics has led to terrible corruption. They understand the reality of power. They have a vote, but is anyone in this House seriously suggesting that Mary Murphy in Fatima Mansions has the same power and influence as Dermot Desmond, Ben Dunne or Tony O'Reilly? If Mary rings the Taoiseach's office and says that she wants to speak to the Taoiseach, will she be put through? What if Ben Dunne or Michael Smurfit rings? That is a much different story. Of course, favours are never sought or given and let us be clear. Under our corporately controlled system, favours seldom have to be sought and they are never explicitly given.</P>
      <P>Corporate money oils the wheels of the political system while the wheels of democracy grind to a halt. Politicians have become the lackeys of big business. This Bill seeks to reclaim the ground for democracy. It seeks to re-empower Mary Murphy and to disempower the corporate world. It seeks a measure of what Karl Marx called democratic control, an unfashionable notion perhaps and one which my Labour colleagues have not referred to, but it is a notion which we must explore. Previous legislation capping election funding and spending has been a positive move, but we need to move much further if we are to restore public confidence in the political process.</P>
      <P>My party believes that as far as practicable all private funding should be removed from the political process. We believe that spending by parties and individuals should be capped, not just at election time but also between elections. The Labour Party Bill does not go far enough but it is a start. There can be no doubt that such legislation will introduce a level of complexity and bureaucracy into Irish politics not seen before. Look at what has happened in the Public Offices Commission, which is breaking new ground all the time. It is cumbersome and time consuming but it is also far better than the system that allowed the rich parties, funded by vested interests, to dominate political life and undermine democracy.</P>
      <P>The Green Party cannot accept the Government amendment which seeks to long-finger this urgent issue. To the Government parties and the Independents who will support them, I say that their prevarication is shameful. Their reticence is perhaps understandable as these parties have benefited most from this discredited system, but they must surely recognise that there is a crisis in Irish politics. The complacency of the Government parties in the face of this crisis is doing even further irreparable damage to the body politic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House must act and those members of the public who still believe in politics demand action. The Green Party believes in action, not just in <Col N="641" /> fine words. When we were offered a substantial donation by AIB many years ago, we refused to take it. Given what we now know about AIB, I am thankful we did. If politics could free itself from the shackles of corporate control, action could be taken against companies such as AIB and CRH but because the corporations have wielded such power, politicians have been afraid to act.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has not ever been afraid to speak out on these matters. We have often been accused of being alarmist and over the top but, regrettably, all our worst fears have been substantiated. When my colleague, Deputy Sargent, stood up in the Dublin County Council chamber holding a cheque aloft and asked if anyone else had received one, he was physically attacked and held in a headlock by Senator Lydon. He was verbally abused and told he was a disgrace. Deputy Sargent asked the right question on that occasion and we in the Green Party will continue to ask difficult questions. We are only beginning the process of uncovering the corruption that affects many sectors of society. We are all aware of the stories surrounding individuals who have yet to be investigated. I have no doubt the scandals will be revealed.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the reaction of the Tánaiste who insisted she was shocked by Frank Dunlop's revelations. Surely she heard the stories and had spoken to others. This morning, one of her party members, Tom Morrissey, said he was offered a substantial bribe. Perhaps the Tánaiste does not want to know because the more that emerges, the more she will have to alter her position on political donations. Surely she realises one cannot rid the system of corruption unless one rids it of corporate donations and that as long as private funding continues, individuals will claim they received a legitimate election donation and not a bribe. The idea of private funding is attractive to a Thatcherite party like the Progressive Democrats. We will support the Labour Party's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gormley has made, in essence, the points which need to be made on behalf of the Green Party. He related the incident in 1993, which Deputies Joe Higgins and Seán Ryan, who were there at the time, will recall &ndash; I hope as vividly &ndash;  and which is also related in detail in Frank McDonald's recent book. There is a need to go beyond what the Labour Party Bill proposes. We hope to be able to make some amendments on Committee Stage, if the Bill gets that far. We must guarantee integrity but also ensure a level of accountability, which is, as yet, unknown in Irish politics. It may be a painful and awkward exercise but it must be done so there is a restoration of confidence in politics, which is at an all time low. Many consumers are unaware that certain companies give money to political parties. They are entitled to know where their money goes.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I have always opposed big business donations to political parties. I will vote for this Bill despite some reservations. I note the conversion of Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the issue of funding by corporations. Three years ago when I said there was no difference between funding given to individual politicians and that given to parties, certain leaders jumped up and down in protest. All the establishment parties have accepted funds from big business. Despite the shock at the revelations of obvious corruption in the planning process in Dublin, some political parties are already attempting to downplay the seriousness of what transpired. The Progressive Democrats have not explained why their councillors pushed the rezoning of 102 acres of land at Harristown on the southern edge of Dublin Airport, when they knew the effect would be that a State body, Aer Rianta, would have to pay 20 or 30 times the cost if they had to buy it for airport expansion. Will the Progressive Democrats come clean on the relationship between them and the landowner? Will the former Progressive Democrats Deputy who, according to the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, gave money to Mr. Dunlop from that landowner also come clean? Will they make a statement to the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell?</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael inquiry into payments made to Fine Gael councillors was a joke and a whitewash. The speed with which Fina Gael cleared it councillors could not have been equalled by a priest in the confessional on a busy Saturday night giving absolution to errant parishioners. It seems to have been a case of &ldquo;Bless me, Father, I have not been influenced&rdquo; and &ldquo;Right, my child, away you go&rdquo;. It was a joke and encouraged Fianna Fáil to conduct their inquiry along the same lines. I sat on Dublin County Council from 1991 to 1993. I saw what went on. The Fine Gael report utterly fails to get to grips with the reality of what went on at that time. It ignores the sleazy, seamy relationships between landowners and developers and councillors from the rezoning alliance of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and occasionally, the Progressive Democrats, as they mingled at their dinners, golf classics and political fundraisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Councillors, including Labour Party councillors, fought for proper planning for weeks, months and years. We now know others walked into the council with wads of cash in brown envelopes in their pockets, given to them in Conway's, with their votes bought outside the chamber. That is the reality of what went on. No party should attempt to whitewash that &ndash; I saw it and the truth must come out. Any councillor who took thousands of pounds from Mr. Frank Dunlop around the time of the Quarryvale controversy is hopelessly compromised and should resign. Any Deputy in this House who took thousands of pounds from Mr. Frank Dunlop around the time of the Quarryvale controversy is hopelessly compromised and should resign. Deputy Lawlor <Col N="643" /> said he took thousands of pounds from Mr. Dunlop around the time of the Quarryvale controversy which damaged proper planning enormously. Deputy Lawlor should resign from this House and let us have a by-election in Dublin West. We can debate proper planning and allow the people have their say, for a change, on this sad, sorry saga. Any other Deputies who accepted thousands of pounds should also resign and let us also have by-elections in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>I would like further discussion on the public funding of political parties. The Socialist Party receives a party leader's allowance, every penny of which goes through the proper channels and is audited by the Minister for Finance. I have serious reservations about the taxpayer carrying the cost of the wholesale funding of elections. This funding should come from the hard work of our members and the pennies and pounds from collections, raffles etc. We should fund our work like this rather than making the taxpayer pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent revelations pose a major challenge to the political system. We now know there was large scale corruption in local government in Dublin in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The picture emerging suggests this involved landowners, developers, local government officials and local politicians. Time will tell whether political culpability went any higher than local level. If that was not enough, we have heard, in the past three or four years, a string of disturbing revelations about Charles J. Haughey and the way in which he ran his party and his country. We have also heard a string of allegations against other senior politicians, many of whom were close colleagues of Mr. Haughey.</P>
      <P>An objective observer would agree that we in this democracy have responded in a reasonable and responsible way to this unfolding story. We have established tribunals, as appropriate, to inquire into the most serious allegations. The McCracken tribunal did a good job and published an excellent report. The Moriarty and Flood tribunals are doing a good job and I am confident they will also publish excellent reports when they have concluded their deliberations. Since the beef tribunal, tribunals of inquiry have had something of a bad name. The present tribunals have suffered their fair share of sniping but they have more than justified their existence. We have also established inquiries under the Companies Act and they are also not immune from the snipers in the long grass. However, the initiatives taken in this area by my colleague, the Tánaiste, will also prove to be well justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all these inquiries and investigations, it seems at times as if the floodgates have opened. How do we respond to this torrent of revelations? We should respond strongly and vigorously but in a reasoned and responsible way. I do not believe in legislating in haste and repenting at lei<Col N="644" /> sure. Our immediate concern is how the Irish political system is funded. The contributions of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to this debate have been remarkable. Listening to those contributions, one would be led to believe that the present law governing political donations and their disclosure is highly deficient. We were led to believe that the law was not working and was open to wholesale abuse. It is worth reminding ourselves that the law governing political donations was conceived, drafted and enacted just three years ago by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Far from highlighting its deficiencies, the Labour Party has always boasted of this legislation as one of its major achievements in Government. The reality is that the legislation has not been tested in any general election campaign, although the experience of several byelections suggests that it works quite well.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there is no scope for further reform but I am surprised that the parties opposite are in such a hurry to tear up their own legislation before it has been given a proper chance to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If further tightening up of the regulations is required, the Progressive Democrats will support it. We will support any new regime which affords fair treatment to smaller parties and Independents and which facilitates the emergence of new parties. We would not, however, support a regime which would fossilise the political system and copperfasten the dominant position of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for another 20 or 30 years. We would not support a regime which would put political parties at a disadvantage<i> vis-à-vis</i> lobby groups which could engage in political campaigns without being governed by political restrictions. We would not support a regime which gave the republican movement an unfair advantage over all the other parties in this House. The republican movement is a broad church with both political and military wings working to a common purpose. I doubt the Public Offices Commission will be able to force the Provisional IRA to open its books for inspection.</P>
      <P>Neither would we support some spurious distinction being made between corporate donations and personal donations. Is Deputy Quinn saying that a contribution from Dunnes Stores is somehow tainted but a personal cheque from Ben Dunne himself is fine? I do not understand the logic behind that. When Deputy Quinn accepted donations from Mr. Dunne, where did he think he got the money? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for cool heads. We should examine this issue in a calm atmosphere and ensure that all aspects of the problem are ventilated and deliberated upon as fully as possible. It is perfectly reasonable to carry out this task on an all-party basis over the next six months. If there are <Col N="645" /> deficiencies in our legislation, they may be in the area of corruption rather than political contributions. Our law on corruption is antiquated &ndash; most of it pre-dates the foundation of the State. Prosecutions have been few. Our law on corruption needs to be modernised and the Progressive Democrats regard this as a priority.</P>
    <P>This issue goes beyond politics. Whatever legislative changes are made will have to take cognisance of the fact that officials as well as politicians can be corrupted. Good laws have been passed by this House, but bad laws have also slipped through. I remind Deputy Quinn of his party's role in the tax amnesty in 1993. That was hardly his party's finest contribution to the political affairs of the State.</P>

      <P>In the early 1990s the Italian political system went through a major crisis. Evidence emerged of widespread corruption and bribery at the very highest levels of politics in that country. It became clear that the people at the top of Italy's political system were guilty of serious wrongdoing or, at the very least, had cases to answer. The public response was dramatic, the system was literally shaken to its foundations. Top politicians were jailed, others fled the country and the biggest political party, which had dominated the country for 50 years, was swept away completely. The whole political order was turned upside down.</P>

      <P>I did not think until I heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, tonight and now the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that after all that has happened, this House is still so divided on this issue. Instead of wringing our hands about imminent political Armageddon, this House should do two things. It should accept the principle of the Labour Party Bill tonight and speedily make any necessary amendments on Committee Stage. It should then allocate £1,000 <Col N="646" /> million of the budget surplus to the compulsory purchase of lands, especially, but not only, in Dublin, for the construction of affordable homes.</P>
      <P>The thinking public would appreciate the significance of banning business contributions. If we had the courage to tackle the manipulation of land, the developers' and builders' lobby would understand that, for the first time, we are really serious about cleaning up Irish politics. All those whinging like Hanrahan that we will all be ruined before the year is out and we must do something, seriously underestimate the intelligence of the public. Anyone who is surprised by the revelations from Dublin Castle must have had very little confidence in the tribunals' capacity to unearth the facts. Instead of nurturing superficial gossip about the political system, we should welcome the fact that at last the boil has been lanced and we can get on with the measures necessary to restore public confidence.</P>
      <P>This is a period of catharsis that the legacies of the late 1980s and early 1990s made inevitable. Our democracy will emerge from it still imperfect but greatly strengthened and enhanced. Politics is not an optional extra. We need make no apology to any of the cynics for its being funded out of the public purse. Of course, it is up to the Government to display the political leadership and vision necessary to take advantage of the work of the tribunals to date to give the necessary inspiration to thinking citizens.</P>
      <P>Sadly, it now appears the Government is capable of neither the leadership nor the vision needed at this time if it persists in voting down the principle of the Labour Party Bill before the House. What chance then that the Government will hit back at the developers where it hurts and, in the process, make homes affordable for our people again? Bacon is a fig-leaf that no longer disguises the Government's abject failure to halt the rampant manipulation and profiteering in land and building that now threaten the very success of this economy.</P>
      <P>No single measure that we could take in this still sovereign Parliament would so confirm to the public that the past is a foreign country than the purchase of land to provide homes for the people. We do not take on, and we will not take on, the profiteering of the developers because the dominant party in this Government is one face of the political-business Siamese twin that is joined at the hip pocket. Instead, we continue to mutter that something must be done and set up death bed inquiries long after the horse has not only bolted but has been consigned to the knacker's yard. The House should ignore superficial comment and demonstrate by practical leadership that the nod and wink culture has also been sent to the knacker's yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public deserve more credit than they are often given in the environs of this House. Unlike some of the more recent adornments to the media corps, the public have an uncanny ability to recognise a deliberate campaign to muddy the waters. Notwithstanding our modern approach to <Col N="647" /> sex education, there are still some grown ups in gainful employment who believe babies are delivered by the stork. Last week I answered many questions and not even the Sisters of Charity would claim the questions were of a uniform high quality. Much of what was written was fair. Some of it was stupid. Some of it was alternatively insightful, nasty, tongue in cheek and careless and some of it was plain daft. None of it, I am glad to say, was malicious, although I gave that exemption before being told about the peculiar form of in-house perverse vindictiveness being operated by <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>, where there is an especially monochrome view of politics, to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>I have consistently believed that, notwithstanding the campaign to muddy the waters, the Flood tribunal would do the job it was set up to do. Clearly others believed that it would never come to this. Others believed that if the beef tribunal failed to draw conclusions, McCracken, Moriarty and Flood would similarly fail to make findings, but they were wrong. The difference is the order for the discovery of bank accounts, an instrument never once resorted to in the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>Some journalists, like Frank McDonald of <i>The Irish Times</i>, to whom there was a reference here this evening, who had another book published this evening, and Brian Dowling of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, did Trojan work in the period concerned. Some of us in this House remember Joe McAnthony back in 1974. Unfortunately, others want to equate the knowledge of today to the suspicions of a decade ago. Little enough attention was paid to a number of key speeches made in this House down through the years. The relatively recent speech of my colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton has now at last been properly highlighted, but going back to the 1980s and early 1990s extensive speeches were made by Deputies Gilmore, Shatter, myself and others.</P>
    <P>For example, only today at the Flood tribunal the matter of a certain transaction at the Strawberry Beds on the route of the M50 motorway was highlighted. That matter was comprehensively put on the record of the House by myself on 21 February 1990. The reference is Column 38 and following columns of the Official Report of 21 February 1990. I gave that reference because I am conscious of imposing an unreasonable burden on the media in terms of research for two weeks in a row.</P>
    <P>The public are intrigued, fascinated and disgusted at what they are learning almost every day, but the thinking public understands this democracy can easily withstand the corrosive and corrupting influence of a small number of politicians who betrayed the trust placed on them by the citizens. The public also understands that our democracy can emerge from this crucible energised and strengthened depending on our capacity to respond. The first test is tonight. If the Government fails that test, it will be the begin<Col N="648" /> ning of the end of its term of office. It will not have any authority or credibility in the current environment. This crisis will not go away. It is likely to get worse. The question of business funding will not go away. At best, the Government's procrastination is to buy time to allow the coffers to be replenished before a general election. This is a cynical price politics cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not recall one incident in the political life of the Taoiseach where he has taken a stance against the public mood. Why is he prepared to change the habit of a lifetime tonight? The answer is simple. He knows that the continuation of business funding confers enormous advantage on his party. He does not want to let go of an enormous advantage enjoyed by Fianna Fáil since the early 1960s. If he is serious about putting the past behind us and especially behind his party, the opportunity is tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not come far in ten years. Yesterday I referred to some passages from the debate on Labour's Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill, 1991. While not directly at issue, the question of funding of politics naturally arose. The current Minister for Health and Children spoke on that debate. Deputy Martin rubbished the idea of what he described as the underlying assumption that widespread corruption may have been going on or particularly that a tremendous number of gifts were being handed to Ministers. In a more constructive tone, he welcomed raising the issue of funding of politics and political parties. Like the Minister before him in the same debate, now Deputy Reynolds, he stated that the matter should be considered by all parties in a non-partisan fashion in &ndash; wait for it &ndash; an all-party committee. Ten years later Fianna Fáil, having put obstacles in the way of the ethics and Electoral Acts, is erecting another barrier to progress.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a fire blanket. It has one purpose, to get the Government from tonight to tomorrow with Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox, Gildea and Blaney along with them. Apparently ten years is not enough. Fianna Fáil needs another six months. The cover is that the issues involved are complex and difficult. That may be so, but the principle is simple. It is about the ending of corporate funding. That is all, no more, no less. We can discuss the detail, which is complex, but the principle is uniquely simple. To buy or not to buy into it, is a decision the Government and the Deputies who support it are refusing to make.</P>
      <P>The issues under consideration have been discussed in political circles for the best part of a decade. As Deputy Howlin has attested, they have featured in decisions on Government formation on two occasions in the 1990s. Progress was made and resulted in the Electoral Act, 1997, an Act whose constitutionality has not been challenged and on which the Bill being debated is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that ten years after this debate <Col N="649" /> began, the Government has yet to formulate its position on the key issue of corporate funding. It has not and it will not because it would like corporate funding to continue. That is a fact. Corporate funding is what has Fianna Fáil where it is today.</P>
    <P>An all-party committee also has obvious attractions for Fianna Fáil. It implies that all parties are equally responsible for the position in which we now find ourselves. It is an inference I totally reject on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>This amendment is the Government's attempt to seem reasonable while behaving utterly unreasonably &ndash; to explain away why long overdue proposals to ban corporate funding are being blocked here this evening. It is an approach consistent with how this issue has been approached over the past ten years by Fianna Fáil. Fine words rendered meaningless by equivocation and delay.</P>
    <P>Remember this is the same Taoiseach who made an urgent personal project of legislation on standards in public office, but that was when banishing the Haughey spectre was an urgent priority. Three years later that legislation has not been published. Last year our whistleblowers Bill was accepted on Second Stage. It has progressed not one millimetre further in the past 12 months &ndash; that reflects some urgency.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those members of the Government parties, like Deputy Fleming and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, who know that the age of corporate funding is gone, to think again. Do not support this sham this evening. End this nonsense. By obfuscating and fudging the issue they do neither politics nor business a favour.</P>
    <P>My party will not take part in a sham consulta<Col N="650" /> tive process. We will not participate in an an-all party approach that does not ban corporate donations. This Bill bans all donations to parties save those from registered electors. The issue concerning Fine Gael about defining corporate entities does not arise.</P>
    <P>We will not be party to an all-party committee that deals only with proposals from the Opposition parties knowing full well, as tonight proves once again, that only the Government has the votes to get proposals through this House.</P>
    <P>My party is reserving its position on participation in an all-party committee. Let nobody be unclear about the principle upon which we are standing tonight. We are not prepared to engage in any type of sham consultative process, if that principle is not accepted up front from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I want to see the colour of the Government's proposals. It either wishes to clean up this sleazy mess, largely of its making, or it does not. It wants to end corporate funding or it does not. Sadly, the indication this evening against the background of Dublin Castle after the past few sickening months is that it does not. If the Taoiseach cannot jump this hurdle, he need not bother putting pen to paper.</P>
    <P>We are being reasonable. We would be happy if our Bill was amended by all sides on Committee Stage as long as its fundamental principle is retained. That is what a Committee Stage debate is about. I remind the absent Deputy Fleming about that core point. I can think of no worse signal to send to a horrified public than this House refusing to endorse the principle of this Bill this evening.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Airport Development Projects.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Users of Cork Airport can tell one that the airport is bursting at the seams. Passenger numbers are expected to exceed two million in the next two years and investment is needed. It cannot cope at present with its expected passenger growth and this is recognised by Aer Rianta, which last September made a presentation of its development plan for the airport starting in 1999, but it is now 2000 and we have seen nothing yet. Those plans included an extension of the passenger terminal, a multi-storey car park and three airbridges to begin with. The long-term plan included further extensions of the terminal and runway.</P>
      <P>These development plans are all very well, but what about the money needed to support those plans? I am being asked those questions and I raise them here to ensure Cork Airport is not omitted from the Government's plans. We witnessed a recent extension to Shannon and yet we see no development in Cork. There are proposals but there are no commitments from the Government. The Minister indicated that she believes the State cannot invest in our airports due to a restriction at European level on State investment and that all the funding for airport investment will have to be found in other ways such as the sale or partial sale of those airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always found it hard to believe the <Col N="655" /> Government would consider the public sale of such a vital part of our national infrastructure. We are an island nation and ours is the only country in Europe without a landbridge connection to the Continent. We are on the periphery of the Continent and it does not make sense to consider the sale of such a vital part of our national infrastructure to private enterprise. We would not consider selling our roads, railways or bridges. Ownership of our airports should remain in public hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument against State funding has been refuted by a European Commission document on competition that I have here. It states that the construction or enlargement of infrastructural projects such as airports, motorways or bridges etc. represents a general measure of economic policy which cannot be controlled by the Commission. The document goes on to state: &ldquo;. under the Treaty rules on State aids, an infrastructural development decision falls outside the scope of application of this communication in so far as they are aimed at meeting planning needs or implementing national, environmental and transport policies.&rdquo;  It is essential for the development of Cork as a region that the Government makes a statement and commits itself to State funding for this airport. I call on the Government to do so now, to commit the necessary funding to the airport. Aer Rianta has the plans and has indicated its commitment to Cork Airport and the necessity for investment given the passenger numbers projection. I ask the Government to put its money where its mouth is and invest in Cork Airport, as it is a vital part of the region. It is vital to tourism, to the economic development of the area and to the people of the area to have a commitment to the future of the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for raising this matter. I am happy to assure her that all the work outlined in the plan is going ahead. I am happy to give that commitment to her and, through her, to Cork and to all who use that airport. The numbers have doubled and the airport handled more than 1.5 million passengers in 1999, as Deputy Clune knows. Aer Rianta set out its plans in this regard at Cork Airport in September 1999. The Cork Airport development plan proposes expenditure of up to £60 million over the next five years and that funding will be utilised. This plan covers both the short-term and long-term development proposals, which involve capital investment on a variety of airfield, terminal and ancillary projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the airfield, apron and taxiway extensions are planned at a total cost of £8 million, which will provide additional capacity for the increasing volume of traffic at the airport and also equip the airport to accommodate larger aircraft &ndash; the necessity for this has been frequently brought to my attention. This development is about to go to tender and will be completed within a year. Aer Rianta informed me that the necessary funding is in place for this project. A 40 acre site acquired <Col N="656" /> by Aer Rianta last year adjoining the airport is being prepared for the provision of future airport facilities, including aircraft parking and cargo facilities. A design team is actively working on plans to double the capacity of the existing terminal building. The project will also include the provision of airbridges and baggage screening, which is a new security standard that will be mandatory by 2003. Preliminary surveys are already under way and construction, which will cost £30 million, is expected to commence in 2001. The finance is in place for that.</P>
    <P>Plans are currently being finalised for an extensive upgrading of the roads, public car parks, including a multi-storey car park for which planning permission has been obtained from Cork County Council, and other infrastructure such as upgrading of the water supply, drainage and sewerage facilities, which will cost £15 million. Work has commenced on the provision of the new water supply and it will be completed by summer 2000, which is quite immediate. This improved water supply will benefit not only the airport but also the local communities. Of the overall capital expenditure programme of £60 million, £6 million was spent in 1999 on the overlay of the runway, while the second project is going to tender, as I said. In addition to the airport development projects I have outlined, work has also commenced on the construction of a new £7 million Great Southern Hotel at the entrance to Cork Airport which will be completed by March next year.</P>
    <P>I saw the great strides being made when I passed through the airport recently &ndash; perhaps others do not see it when travelling through the area. I understand Deputy Clune's concerns. When one is from an area one is keen on everything that goes with that area. People are right to express their opinions and my job is to answer their questions. I applaud the Deputy's determination, but if I am told that £6 million has been spent and tenders are out to spend another £8 million I must accept that. It is clear that Aer Rianta is actively progressing the necessary work to satisfy the immediate demands on the airport. A model and detailed plans showing all the developments will be put on display in Cork Airport within the next month so that airport users will be able to see for themselves what has been done and what is in store. It is a successful operation. Traffic for the first four months of this year was up 20% over the same period last year. What is being said is that the airport is jam-packed and that the new facilities are necessary. It has the fastest growth rate of the three State airports this year. All the indications are that Cork Airport will have another record year and the construction work in progress is no more than a symptom of its success.</P>
    <P>I compliment Aer Rianta on its hard work and the Deputies who serve the area.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Gangland Killings.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The brutal murder last weekend of Mr. Derek Benson brings to 18 the number of unsolved gangland killings in Dublin over the past 18 months. Gangland killings are yet again a feature of the criminal underworld in the city and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline to the House the measures he intends taking to tackle this appalling increase in cold blooded murder.</P>
      <P>Gangland killings are clear evidence of the upsurge in the power and viciousness of criminal gangs. Organised crime in the Dublin region was severely disrupted by the concerted and effective legislation and security response initiated by the previous Government, and which in fairness was continued to some extent by the current Government. However, it appears this original success in jailing key criminal figures and forcing others to flee the jurisdiction has not been sustained. The breaking up of major criminal gangs has left a vacuum which is now being filled by a new generation of young, ruthless drug dealers who will go to whatever lengths are necessary to protect their evil trade. This re-emergence of violent drug gangs has happened while the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has been in office.</P>
      <P>When on this side of the House Deputy O'Donoghue claimed to have all the answers to solving our crime problems. The increasing upsurge in serious crime, such as murder and armed robbery, prove how shallow and self-serving his posturing was. As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice when in Opposition, the current Minister spoke on this matter in the House on 28 November 1995. The soundbite politics which were central to his policy were then in full flight. He labelled 1995 the year of the criminal. What followed was a typical pot-pourri of political point scoring and unfulfilled commitments to action, such as his call for ballistic testing of all firearms sold in the State. What action has he taken on that commitment in the three years he has been in the Department?</P>
      <P>Unlike the Minister's performance in Opposition, I do not believe that stoking public fear in the hope of garnering publicity is the appropriate manner in which to address the shocking rise in organised crime. Well thought out policies which address the immediate needs of the Garda and which tackle the vicious cycle of poverty and drug abuse are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What discussions has the Minister had with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the serious upsurge in the activities of violent criminal gangs in Dublin City? Have legislative or resourcing proposals been put to the Minister by the Garda and will the Minister take action on foot of those proposals? Will the Minister explain why the first person to bear the brunt of the changes in the <Col N="658" /> bail laws was a 13 year-old who could not come up with £3 in court yesterday, while on the same day three individuals charged with the importation of illegal drugs with a value of £15 million saw their court case collapse due to the absence of a certificate from the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Will the Minister explain to the House the co-ordinated measures the Government intends putting in place to eradicate the poverty which grips so many working class communities and which has a direct link to the number of young people drawn into a life of crime and violence, the ultimate consequence of which can be violent death?</P>
    <P>The spectre of organised crime is once again dangerously on the rise in society, including in this city. The Minister has made the ridiculous claim that crime levels have dropped to those of the 1950s. The facts I have outlined contradict this errant nonsense. The Minister should seriously address the upsurge in organised crime and take the opportunity to outline a comprehensive response rather than issue the characteristic soundbites to which we have become accustomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given this opportunity to address the issue of the recent murders in Dublin City.</P>
      <P>First, the Garda authorities have informed me that provisional figures show that for the country as a whole in the period from 1 January to date, a total of 18 murders have been recorded, 11 of which have been detected to date.</P>
      <P>It is opportune to point out that all violent crimes, particularly murders, are given the highest priority by the Garda and are the subject of rigorous Garda investigation. However, I should emphasise that not all the circumstances of some recent cases are yet known. I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to comment regarding ongoing Garda investigations. While there has been much media speculation about some recent murders, the identification of the motive in all such cases and the evidence available in support are, as the Deputy will be aware, key elements of the investigation and prosecution processes and this clearly constrains what I can say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that while the term &ldquo;gangland killing&rdquo; is widely used by the media, it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda classify such crimes. In any event murder is murder whatever the circumstances surrounding it. It is one of the most despicable crimes known to mankind. While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the motives involved in specific cases there are, of course, grave concerns that organised criminal gangs may be involved in some recent murders. I wish to make it clear that the Garda will do <Col N="659" /> everything in their power to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>Organised crime by its very nature creates a climate of fear, not only for the general public but also among criminal elements. We are all aware that there are huge profits involved in organised criminal activity, in particular the vile and evil drugs trade. To the criminal gangs involved in these activities money is power and in pursuit of this money and power they are prepared to take whatever action is necessary, however ruthless or barbaric, to protect their positions.</P>
    <P>In this context criminal gangs, both in Ireland and internationally, have used and will continue to use violence. This, regrettably, is nothing new. This use of violence includes intimidation, both verbal and physical, beatings and occasionally murder. This use of violence and intimidation as a sanction by and within criminal groups can be very problematic for law enforcement agencies everywhere.</P>
    <P>The victims in these cases are frequently members of criminal groups and, accordingly, the Garda can encounter difficulties in obtaining information. Even in some cases when the victims are innocent outsiders, unfortunately, the element of fear is still there. Despite these difficulties every effort is made by the Garda to investigate these crimes. In particular, as I mentioned, murder is given the highest priority regardless of the circumstances or speculation regarding individual cases.</P>
    <P>For my part, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and indeed while I was the Opposition spokesman on Justice, my commitment to dealing with the twin menace of drugs and organised crime is something for which I make no apology. My policy is and will continue to be to tackle this problem with tough resolution.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of the State has An Garda Síochána been better resourced or equipped. Garda strength is heading towards an all time historic high of 12,000. My anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results with a further fall of 5% in crime figures last year leading to a cumulative fall of 21% since the Government took office. In addition, we are on target for increasing prison capacity in an unprecedented way. I also believe that the new restrictions on bail should prove particularly effective in helping tackle organised and all other crime.</P>
    <P>This policy of strong legislation and increased resources, backed up by tough enforcement, is vital to tackle drugs and organised crime. Legislation, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 which I introduced while in Opposition, and the recent Criminal Justice Act, 1999 which substantially strengthened the law in relation to drug trafficking provides the backbone for a modern <Col N="660" /> criminal justice system geared to cope with the challenges posed by organised criminal gangs.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the Garda Síochána in general and the specialist units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are well documented and there is no need for me to go into them on this occasion. Suffice to say the Deputy can be assured that whatever response is required from a law enforcement perspective will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Of course, as I have said before on numerous occasions, the drugs problem cannot be solved by law enforcement measures alone. The correlation between drugs, crime and disadvantage are well documented and in this context a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the problem at a local level is the cornerstone of the Government's national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to tackling the drugs problem is the right way to go. Our legislative and law enforcement response to the twin menace of drugs and organised crime has been acknowledged as among the most effective in Europe. Our partnership with local communities is beginning to turn the tide in tandem with this.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that even the most effective policies cannot totally prevent the use of violence and, even murder, by organised criminal groups. This is an international problem, not just an Irish one, but that does not mean there is any room for complacency. The activities of criminal gangs are a cause of deep concern and it will be clear from my record and that of the Government that we will not shrink from our responsibilities in this. I know from my discussions with the Garda Commissioner how seriously he views crimes such as those referred to by the Deputy and he has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and bring those involved to justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin was a member of that element of the rainbow coalition Government which opposed tooth and nail every measure I put forward when in Opposition to address our antiquated bail laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaving certificate examination is the defining moment in any young person's life and how he or she performs impacts significantly on his or her life thereafter. For this reason, it is imperative that every student gets a fair crack of the whip. Because I believe the student at the centre of this debate is not being given a fair chance, I sought to raise the matter. I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding this student's case only came to my attention in recent days. I was approached when the student, his parents and his school had exhausted all other avenues. I raise the case not because I believe the student should be treated more favourably than any other in similar circumstances but because a mistake has been made in dealing with his application, which should be corrected. I have raised this matter with officials in the Minister's office and with an official in the examination office in Athlone, all to no avail. I understand the proffered reasons they cannot accede to the request for special concessions, but I do not accept them as valid as they are based on an incorrect premise, which I will explain.</P>
      <P>First, the student in question was referred to a senior psychologist to evaluate his current level of intellectual functioning. His scores on the Ravens standard progressive matrices indicate that he is functioning within the superior range of intelligence. The psychologist recommended that concessions be made by the Department of Education and Science in respect of his leaving certificate, but these have been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the student's performance in the junior certificate is at variance with somebody identified as within the superior range of intelligence. This clearly indicates a specific learning difficulty and failure to recognise this is nothing short of discrimination. Third, during the Department's evaluation of this student's application for special arrangements in the form of extra time for his examinations a departmental official, whose name I will provide to the Minister, if necessary, <Col N="662" /> indicated to a teacher in the school concerned, who was responsible for presenting the application on behalf of the school, that the student's need could be served by using a dictaphone or tape recorder. This is implicit recognition of his difficulty and the Minister should consider this development carefully. The student, having no experience of the technology, found it unsuitable and intimidating &ndash; a hindrance rather than a help. This is also the professional view of the school and teacher involved. This is the fault line in the Department's decision.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I understand the Department has circulars, policy statements, pilot schemes, expert review groups and independent appeals systems which impact on this area. It may be difficult to comprehend but I firmly believe a mistake has been made in this case, which should be rectified. The evidence I outlined supports this view. The pilot scheme to be introduced in this year's leaving certificate, whereby an optional extra 20 minutes will be available to all students, has been presented to me in discussions with departmental officials as a partial solution to this student's problem in any event. However, it is far from one. Notwithstanding that this optional extra 20 minutes applies only to Irish, English, history and geography, it will merely accentuate his difficulty in so far as mainstream students will use the additional time to polish their scripts, raise the overall standard of results and, thus, put greater pressure on all students in circumstances similar to those of the student under consideration in this debate.</P>
    <P>This student and all similar students need additional time over and above that of mainstream students. The other subjects he is taking in the leaving certificate not covered by the pilot scheme, namely biology and business organisation, require a great deal of writing and will exacerbate an already difficult situation. I ask the Minister of State to revisit this case urgently. Not just an examination, but in all likelihood, a lifetime rests in the balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>To aid the Deputy's comprehension, it might be useful to explain the background and context to the arrangements made for the assessment of candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. The previous Minister for Education and Science in late 1998 requested the Expert Advisory Group on Certificate Examinations, a body he established in December 1997, to provide independent advice and evaluation on the operation of examinations and to prepare a discussion paper on the difficult and complex issues concerning the provision of special arrangements at the examinations for students with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion paper set out the current arrangements for candidates with special needs <Col N="663" /> and provided descriptions of approaches followed by examining bodies in Great Britain. It proposed a number of principles which should underlie the provision of special arrangements and identified a series of issues requiring discussion. The paper was published in May 1999. Responses were invited from interested parties in advertisements in the national newspapers and the paper was also made available to all schools. It was published on the Internet and more than 200 submissions were received.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration of the submissions the advisory body prepared a report for the Minister in which it set out the principles on which the provision of arrangements might be based. These principles aim to strike a correct balance between ensuring, on the one hand, that candidates with special needs are given every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment while, on the other, not giving any candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination. Among the principles proposed are that provision should be made for both physical and learning disabilities; special arrangements should not put the integrity, status or reputation of the examination at risk; special arrangements are designed to assist a candidate in demonstrating his or her achievements in an examination setting but are not designed to compensate for a lack of achievement arising from a disability; and since a core principle of the certificate examinations is to ensure equitable treatment for all candidates, arrangements should not give the candidate for whom they are made an advantage over other candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory group report considered the issues that relate to extending examination time for some candidates at length. It noted that the provision of extra time has the potential to allow a candidate to provide additional information in response to questions or to attempt additional questions. On the face of it, then, additional time could confer an unfair advantage on individual candidates. On the other hand, however, it can be argued that for some candidates additional time would do no more than enable them to access the test instrument in a way available to all candidates. The group considered that attempting to ensure that extra time is restricted only to those who would achieve no advantage is well nigh impossible. It would require intensive screening of each individual applicant by professionals and even then, given the variation in the nature and severity of special needs, it would be extremely difficult to decide how much time was required by a candidate and whether the additional time conferred an advantage in the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Accordingly, the group recommended that an alternative way forward that might meet the special needs of many candidates while, at the same time, preserving the integrity of the examination system, would be to make the time element of examinations less critical. They proposed that all candidates might be given the option of availing of a limited increase in time of 15 to 20 minutes, but that this option would not be available in all examinations on the basis that extra time would not be required in all subjects.</P>
    <P>Specifically, they proposed that, on a pilot basis, in the leaving certificate examination in 2000, all candidates be offered the option of availing of an additional 15 to 20 minutes in a small number of subjects. The examinations to which this proposal would apply should be determined in consultation with chief examiners. They recommended that the selected subjects should be ones taken by large numbers of candidates, in which time seems to be a critical issue, and that a number of subjects in the humanities, which involve extensive essay writing, would seem to meet these criteria. If the proposal is adopted, they recommended that its implementation should be monitored and the situation should be reviewed in light of the experience gained in the pilot project.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science accepted the general set of principles identified in the report of the expert advisory group as a sound basis for dealing with this complex and difficult area and decided to begin the process of implementing their recommendations for the current year's examinations. The measures the Minister has introduced make the examination system more flexible and responsive to the needs of students who would otherwise have difficulty with some examination subjects because of their special needs. This represents a significant advance in the inclusiveness of the examination system as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted upon the group's recommendation in relation to additional time and extended the time for a number of subjects at this year's leaving certificate examination for all candidates. As recommended by the expert advisory group the position will subsequently be reviewed.</P>
    <P>A further initiative taken by the Minister for Education and Science this year was to put in place an appeals group that is totally independent of the Department. The appeals group can adjudicate on individual cases where an applicant is not satisfied with the arrangements proposed and determine the case in line with the principles set out by the expert advisory group. The creation of an independent appellate procedure ensures that any candidate has ready access in an open and transparent way to a fair and unbiased hearing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> Given that an independent appeal procedure exists and given the overriding requirement that all candidates should be treated in a fair and consistent manner, it would be incorrect for any Minister to intervene at the level of an individual candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise the matter of the need for special facilities to be installed to cater for a class at St. Joseph's girls' national school in Skibbereen. The principal and class teacher in the school have made numerous phone calls and have written to various Departments about the lack of facilities in the special class for children with severe and profound learning disabilities, but they have received no communication or help. They feel it is of the utmost importance that priority be given to adapting a classroom which is suitable for their needs. These children cannot speak for themselves so I am putting pressure on the Minister to do something immediately. The children in the special class are all wheelchair bound and have associated severe medical conditions. They are totally dependent on staff for all their needs, including feeding, moving, changing position and lifting. In order to develop the children to their full potential, they require funding for a Leckey Pronestander. They also need funding for physio-equipment, such as wedges and rolls, and multi-sensory equipment.</P>
      <P>Since this is the only mainstream school in the south to have taken on a class of children with severe and profound learning disabilities, the principal and class teacher feel that for the project to succeed it needs to be properly supported and funded by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Parents of the pupils visit the special class regularly and they are disappointed with the lack of progress by the Department. The board of management is equally disappointed. When the school management agreed to take on this class it was led to believe by the Department of Education and Science that funding would not be a problem. The school management demands an immediate response to the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher of the special class is working in a classroom that is 30 ft. long by 26 ft. wide. The school inspector asked her to contact the Department about reorganising the classroom to suit the needs of the class. Three of the children are in wheelchairs and one is ambulant. A changing area, separate from the classroom and feeding area, is required for all four children. They are examining a toilet area of the classroom where a folding accordeon-type door could be installed to separate the changing area. A folding bench could also be installed <Col N="666" /> on one wall for changing nappies. It could be folded down when not in use to make more room. One toilet in the area could be removed to make room for a therapy bath. Hot water needs to be installed in this area as well as in the feeding area. The classroom area needs a multi-sensory corner. A rail is also required, about 8 ft. by 10 ft., to corner off an area with a dark curtain for ILV light use and relaxation.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, will the Department consider the provision of a small portakabin or a pre-fab attached to the outer wall of the classroom, with a door leading to the portakabin which could be used as a multi-sensory room? In this way, children from the other classrooms could benefit from this facility.</P>
    <P>Needed outdoors also is a ramp for transport to gain access to the path leading to the school and a ramp to the entrance door of the classroom from the path. Action is needed immediately on this important matter &ndash; action speaks louder than words. In this Celtic tiger age there is supposed to be an unlimited source of money throughout the country. The Minister should consider this unfortunate section of our community, particularly those children who have been taken on by the school management who provide them with special education. I appeal to the Minister to give me an assurance that he will provide funding for the requirements that I have outlined. In so doing, the Minister will alleviate a serious problem in that school.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding facilities for the special class at St. Joseph's girls' national school, Skibbereen, County Cork. Currently the school has a staffing level of principal, five assistant teachers, one shared remedial teacher, one permanent learning disability teacher and one shared resource teacher. The current enrolment is 175 mainstream pupils plus four pupils with special needs. The school's present facilities consist of eight permanent classrooms, a general purpose room, library-medical room, remedial room, principal's office and storage, including secure, safe storage.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is in receipt of an application from the school management for funding towards additional facilities and equipment for the special class. A member of the Department's architectural staff carried out a technical inspection on 10 May 2000. A report is currently in preparation and is expected to be completed shortly. The building unit will be in contact with the school management regarding their needs as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a large number of schools building projects on <Col N="667" /> hand in the Department. Because of the priority which the Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, the Department has significantly reduced the burden of fundraising by <Col N="668" /> schools and communities throughout the country. I assure Deputy Sheehan that the application by the management authorities of St. Joseph's girls' national school, Skibbereen, will be dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I last briefed the Dáil on progress under the strategic management initiative in October 1999. At that time I referred to the launch last July of the next phase of the SMI, and to the specific initiatives which were designed to improve the functioning of the Civil Service and its capacity to deliver high quality services effectively.</P>
      <P>A table which will be circulated in the Official Report shows the progress of various elements of the SMI. I am looking forward to continuing further early progress on the individual initiatives.</P>
      <P>The agreement of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with its focus on public service modernisation, will facilitate the speedy implementation of the framework for public service modernisation, with a particular emphasis on developing a sectoral approach. Strategies for the Civil Service and the education, health and local authority sectors are set out in detail. The programme also makes a specific link between the achievement of performance indicators relating to the modernisation programme and the payment of the final 4% of the pay agreement. The SMI implementation group will issue guidelines to Departments to assist them in meeting the requirements under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue of regulatory reform, the following are the main developments. In July 1999 the Government published Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland. Among other things, the action programme required each Department and office to consult with customers and other interested parties as to the priorities for regulatory reform. Based on those consultations, each Department and office has now listed the relevant legislation, both primary and secondary, and the regulatory reform unit and the Statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General have been working closely to establish priorities for a work programme of consolidation, revision, repeal or restatement, as appropriate. Consultation with Departments and offices on this programme is ongoing. When completed, the work programme will be submitted by me to Government for its approval. At a recent meeting, the Government agreed to the publication of a Bill which will empower the Attorney General to prepare versions of Acts of the Oireachtas, to be known as restatements, in a more readable form without <Col N="671" /> altering the substance of the legislation and, accordingly, will not require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The aim of this proposal is to make statute law more accessible and readable. It is expected that the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. Finally, the OECD are undertaking a <Col N="672" /> country review of regulatory reform in Ireland, which will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>These initiatives demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to making it easier, where possible, to do business with Government, and to make legislation more coherent and accessible.</P>

      <P>This matter has been under consideration by the Office of the Attorney General including the Chief State Solicitor's office. They believe that the most effective approach is to facilitate entry to the insurance link service by those Departments with a significant volume of personal injury claims, rather than providing a central service through the Chief State Solicitor's office. I understand that Departments will shortly be asked to consider joining the service and advised on the steps necessary for them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The former Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, began his work at the end of January. He is the sole member of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. I have made clear that, if the former chief justice requires any additional resources or support, this will be provided. Detailed terms of reference in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were agreed with the former chief justice and with the justice for the Forgotten Group representing the injured and bereaved relatives some time ago. Mr. Hamilton is currently engaged in his examination of these bombings.</P>
      <P>While it had been hoped the former chief justice would have been able to submit his report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings before the summer break, it is understood that this will not now be possible, although it is hoped that the report will be available in September.</P>
      <P>Discussions between the relevant Departments and offices on the detailed terms of reference for the examination of the Dundalk bombing are close to finalisation, following which they will be the subject of consultation with the legal representatives of the victims' relatives and with Mr. Hamilton.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific case raised by the Deputy, I have received a number of representations to have a public inquiry held into it. However, the best way forward in my view is for the Government to extend the remit of Mr. Hamilton to this case on a basis broadly similar to that which applies in the case of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. In this regard, discussions between the Departments and offices concerned on the detailed terms of reference are close to a conclusion, following which proposals will be put before the Government. If approved by the Government, the proposed terms will be the subject of consultation with Mr. Hamilton and with the legal representatives of the victim's relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> I have also received representations seeking different forms of examination of other cases of concern referred to in the report of the Victims Commission, such as the earlier Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976 and a fatal shooting at the bridge between Lifford and Strabane in 1971. Commissioner Wilson's report, while not recommending that these cases should be the subject of a formal inquiry, did recommend that &ldquo;the Government, taking heed of the need to preserve the confidentiality and safety of information, should, on request from the families of victims, produce reports on the investigations of murders arising from the conflict over the last 30 years where no one has been made amenable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly make a submission to Government on the report of the Victims Commission, and this will take account of the report's recommendation in relation to these other cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's action plan for the development of the information society in Ireland was launched in January 1999. The plan covers a number of areas such as infrastructure, legislation, electronic public services, access, etc., and mandates Departments and agencies to undertake specific tasks to ensure quick adoption of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the plan, major initiatives under way include the provision of broadband connectivity to Europe and the US is well advanced with bandwidth being sold on to the private sector. Work is also under way on providing broadband infrastructure to the regions and significant funding has been allocated to this in the national development plan; the e-commerce Bill which will give a legal framework to e-commerce transactions is currently before the Oireachtas and should be enacted later this month or next month; Enterprise Ireland is currently running e-business initiatives to raise awareness of e-commerce among SME's and the joint Information Society Commission-IBEC awareness initiative for the business community has recently concluded. Initiatives to increase awareness among the general public include a TV series on technology aimed at those wary of technology, which recently started on RTE; the Information Society Commission has recently published a report on IT Access for All, which contains recommendations to enable universal participation in the information age. Arising from this an interdepartmental group is being established to draw up an access strategy; pilot projects on the electronic delivery of public services have commenced with the FÁS online job resource for jobseekers and employers and the Land Registry online service. Work is in progress on the Revenue online service for processing tax returns; this week the Government approved a framework for the delivery of integrated electronic public services and decided that each Department should prepare a strategy for the development of such services; the recent appointment of a director and deputy director of REACH will facilitate its task of designing e-public service delivery systems around life and business events; the Government recently authorised commencement of an e-Cabinet project to bring the benefits of new technologies to the Cabinet process; and a dedicated information society fund has been established with funding of £30 million this year. To date more than £16 million has been committed to 38 <Col N="676" /> projects through the fast track evaluation process to facilitate quick start-ups.</P>
    <P>A second progress report on the action plan was published in July 1999 and a third report last April. The action plan and progress reports are available on the e-Ireland page of my Department's website.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The approved staffing levels in the Office of the Attorney General are set out in the following table which will be circulated in the Official Report. The vacancies are to be filled by means of open competition through the Civil Service Commission. The arrangements for a senior draftsman recruitment competition are being made at the moment.</P>
      <P>The vacancies in the administration category are at clerical level. Assignments have already been received for four of these vacancies. In addition the office uses contract people for a number of specialist positions including library, drafting and indexing. The office is in discussion with the Department of Finance and expects to increase its numbers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are difficulties in accessing the Irish Statute Book on the website of the Office of the Attorney General. I understand that the problem is currently being addressed by the office. The existing service on the website provides the Acts of the Oireachtas from 1922 to 1997 only, and is an interim solution which was put in place at the beginning of 1999. The office of the Attorney General is making arrangements to have the Statute Book from 1922 to 1998, comprising Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables, available on the website.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the existing difficulties is that the service uses the same software as the version of the Irish Statute Book which was published on CD-ROM at the end of 1998. The software used to publish the Irish Statute Book had been optimised for use on CD-ROM. Another difficulty is that the current service is hosted in South Africa, as the company which originally carried out the project is based there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a review of the issues involved and a subsequent tendering exercise, the office recently <Col N="677" /> selected a company to carry out required enhancements and updates to the website facility. This will comprise making the latest electronic version of the Irish Statute Book available on the web, i.e. Acts of the Oireachtas, statutory instruments and the chronological tables to the statutes from 1922 to 1998, and improving the design and search capabilities of the service. In addition, the service will be implemented in a format more suitable for use on the Internet and will be hosted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The approximate duration of the project will be four months.</P>

      <P>The table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report indicates the number of women within the Permanent Defence Force as at mid-February 2000, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available from the military authorities. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-commissioned ranks across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The military authorities advise that in previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5' 4&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Following the appointment of a new secretary general to the Irish Red Cross Society in 1999, one of the first tasks he undertook was a strategic review of the operation of the society. I am informed that the strategic review will encompass the views and opinions of all organs of the society to ensure the strengthening and development of the society. I understand this review will be inclusive, involving volunteers and all staff members. The Irish Red Cross is being assisted by a consultant in these matters. It is intended that the review will be completed by mid-2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of <Col N="680" /> recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations could be proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that will contribute to the overall development of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I have always emphasised the importance of involving all of the relevant stakeholders in the process. That is why I established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State's air and sea services. This consultation group, which I chair, is made up of representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. To date the group has held an initial meeting at which I invited stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>In October 1998, I directed the chief of staff to arrange for the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. Draft implementation plans for both services were submitted to me late last year. After careful consideration of both plans, I decided that additional work needed to be done to augment the draft implementation plan for the Naval Service. The chief of staff recently submitted a revised draft plan for my consideration.</P>
    <P>I have recently written to the chief of staff in response to the draft Air Corps plan, which, among other things, requires revision in the light of recent decisions contained in the White Paper on Defence.</P>
    <P>Only when these plans have been finalised can the consultation group's principal work begin. Further meetings of the group will occur as the implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that an updated Defence Forces personnel management plan should be prepared as a matter of priority. This plan will include a continuation of the policy of <Col N="681" /> regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Defence Forces. The chief of staff will manage recruitment to maintain the 10,500 strength and, to this end, funding for a recruitment advertising campaign was delegated to him in April 2000. A campaign to recruit an additional 750 personnel, including 20 Air Corps recruits and 130 Naval Service recruits, commenced recently. In addition, a competition to recruit 60 cadets, including 12 Air Corps and 16 Naval Service cadets, is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The broader development of both services has been dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence which presented a positive opportunity to develop the Defence Forces for the long-term.  Investment in both services continued during the White Paper process and considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote on weapons, ammunition, transport, communications and equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service. I have very recently announced decisions in relation to major new equipment programmes which is a key element of White Paper implementation.</P>
    <P>Air Corps capabilities will be augmented through a special £55 million investment programme over the next three years, with procurement of new helicopters being given a special priority.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service vessel replacement programme has already commenced with the planned acquisition of a second new state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the <i>le Roísín</i> at a cost of some £20 million, as a replacement for the <i>le Deirdre</i> which has been in service for nearly 30 years and is approaching the end of its economic service life.</P>
    <P>As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Following a survey of the older vessels of the Naval Service fleet, a small quantity of asbestos was found in the machinery spaces of the four offshore patrol vessels &ndash;<i>le Deirdre</i>, <i>le Emer</i>, <i>le Aoife</i> and <i>le Aisling</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1999, specialist firms were contracted to remove the hazardous material under the supervision of a firm of environmental consultants. The work was carried out in late December 1999 and early January 2000. The asbestos was removed in accordance with stan<Col N="682" /> dards approved by the Health and Safety Authority. A clean air certificate was then issued by the consultants and the vessels resumed fishery patrols.</P>
    <P>Ships companies of the patrol vessels have been advised on all known health risks relating to exposure to asbestos. In addition, all Naval Service personnel are screened for asbestos related illness as part of their annual medical examination.</P>
    <P>This matter was given top priority in my Department. I am satisfied that the issue was resolved as speedily as possible and in line with health and safety requirements.</P>

      <P>I fully support the principle of commissioning suitably qualified non-commissioned personnel in all areas of the Defence Forces. The military authorities advise that of those officers currently in service, a total of 52 or 4.2% have been promoted from non-commissioned rank.</P>
      <P>Non-commissioned personnel who attain particular specialist or degree qualifications may be appointed to commissioned rank to fill vacancies in areas in which they are qualified provided that they satisfy an interview board as to their suitability. It is the policy that the filling of such vacancies by commissioning enlisted personnel be given first consideration.</P>
      <P>In 1998 two non-commissioned personnel were commissioned as air traffic control officers in the Air Corps. Two non-commissioned Naval Service personnel were commissioned as electrical engineer officers in the Naval Service on 3 November 1999. In March this year, three suitably qualified non-commissioned personnel were commissioned as officers in the information technology area of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>A potential officers course for 15 Army and Air Corps personnel commenced on 13 September last and is due to be completed in July 2000. Successful candidates will be commissioned as officers on 3 July next. A course commenced in January 2000 for nine Naval Service personnel who will be commissioned as watchkeeping officers on successful completion of their course.</P>
      <P>The recently published White Paper on Defence provides for the preparation of an updated Defence Forces personnel management plan, which will include as one of its elements, regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
      <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows. The first of the new fleet of armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, will be produced at the end of this year and deliveries will be completed by early 2002.</P>
      <P>There has been significant investment in recent years on new vehicles for the Army with over £6.5 million spent in 1999 on heavy lift-load carrying vehicles which are being used in Kosovo, and other heavy duty trucks for use throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I recently announced an investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. Last month, I signed the contract for the second new ship for the Naval Service which will be similar to <i>le Róisín</i> and will cost more than £20 million.</P>
      <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It will ensure the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will be fully equipped with the most modern of equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision of living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces, a special reinvestment programme was initiated in 1999 to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works. The special programme is centred on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork, and is expected to result in the investment of more than £50 million in additional funding in the period to the end of 2003. It is estimated that the <Col N="685" /> combined cost of all new buildings and projects for the up-grading of existing buildings throughout the Defence Forces will exceed £100 million by that date. Substantial progress is being made. In April 2000 I opened the new men's dining hall at Collins Barracks, Cork, and work commenced on the building of a new NCO's mess at the barracks. About 20 further projects valued at more than £47 million are due to commence throughout the remainder of this year.</P>

    <P>The maintenance costs paid to date in respect of Devoy Barracks total £6,289.75. This figure is lower than the figure previously indicated for that location in a reply given on 28 March 2000, as the figures for maintenance costs at Magee Barracks, Kildare and Devoy Barracks, Naas were inadvertently transposed in that earlier reply.</P>
    <P>The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovar refugees on 12 May 1999. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further security costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to that property.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £540,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs <Col N="686" /> such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £88,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 72, 102 and 143   together.</P>
      <P>The recently published White Paper on Defence states that the Government is committed to ensuring that all components of the Defence Forces organisation are adequately equipped to carry out their assigned roles.</P>
      <P>The Government's plans for the development of the Defence Forces envisage the re-direction of resources largely from manpower to the acquisition of modern equipment. To advance this process, a high level civil-military planning and procurement group will formulate a five year plan to address the equipment needs of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these urgent requirements I was pleased to announce on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps under the direction of the high level civil-military planning and procurement group. This substantial funding for the Air Corps in the short-term will ensure that the Air Corps is ready and equipped to carry out different taskings as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future development of the Air Corps will be determined within a range of policy parameters which were set down in the White Paper <Col N="687" /> and include a full time helicopter capability for military and non-military, for example Garda support, tasks; fishery protection and search and rescue services as agreed with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; and air ambulance and ministerial air transport services.</P>
    <P>The extent and nature of these services will, of necessity, be a determinant of the type of aircraft to be provided for the Air Corps. In that regard, I should say that the Government has decided that Air Corps equipment resources will not be committed to any overseas operations. The work of the high level group will take all these matters into account when devising a balanced investment strategy for the corps for the next five years.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the technical specifications and other documentation required for the commencement of the procurement process in relation to new medium range helicopters for search and rescue are being prepared. A joint civil-military project team has been set up to organise and oversee the tender competition and eventual evaluation and selection of the most suitable aircraft. Arrangements for the acquisition of a helicopter for training Air Corps pilots working with the Garda air support unit are also in train.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of appropriate fixed-wing aircraft for the Air Corps will also be considered by the high level planning and procurement group. In the meantime, the recommendations of the general officer commanding the Air Corps as regards essential training needs of cadets and pilots have been considered by the civil and military authorities in the Department and have been generally agreed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 58, 97 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall strategy for the development of the Defence Forces Reserve is based on the report <Col N="688" /> of a special steering group established by me in January, 1998. The group produced its report in September 1999, and the recommendations contained in the report have been accepted as a general basis on which the development of the Defence Forces Reserve can proceed. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the reserve has now been undertaken involving a considerable amount of work by both a military board which was set up by the chief of staff and the steering group. The military board, as part of its task sought the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the reserve. From the outset there was ongoing liaison between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group were attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who kept the group well briefed on the board's progress. The steering group also advised the military board regarding aspects of the reserve that should be examined or that should be looked at in greater depth by the military board.</P>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February, An Slua Muirí will be developed to improve the capacity of members to provide a genuine naval reserve capability based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel. As a rationalisation measure the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Muirí will be amalgamated. The Naval Service, in conjunction with the director of reserve forces, will formulate specific proposals to develop an integration role for the re-organised An Slua Muirí and I am advised by the military authorities that with that in mind a process of briefings and visits to the various companies of An Slua has already commenced.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on Defence recognised that a feature of the existing FCA organisation is that it has a country-wide geographical spread which will in general be retained. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the implementation process which will consist of the development of a Defence Forces Reserve review implementation plan based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes will take place over a period of six years. There will be a requirement for the military authorities to consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of reserve units within each brigade area and I am advised by the military authorities that such proposals are being drawn up at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The blueprint for the new Defence Forces Reserve will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve which will consist of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training and career development opportunities and will be provided with appropriate equipment. The other element will provide the overall army reserve, will be organised into three brigades and the personnel will be trained on standard military lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60, 67, 71 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>After the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 7 December 1999 in the case of Hanley <i>v </i>Minister for Defence, I wrote to the Law Society of Ireland asking it to act as a channel of communication between the State and the leading plaintiffs' solicitors in Army hearing loss litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the good offices of the Law Society, which facilitated the emergence of a group representing the plaintiffs' solicitors, two meetings took place between officials of my Department and of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the <Col N="690" /> plaintiffs' solicitors' representatives. These meetings were held on 3 February 2000 and 1 March 2000 in Blackhall Place.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the meetings was to explore the possibility of establishing a mechanism on a pilot basis whereby disposal of Army hearing loss litigation could be speeded up and removed from the courts using the Hanley tariff prescribed by the Supreme Court. Following these meetings it was agreed that Army hearing loss claims which were due to come before the High Court in Dublin during the Easter term which commenced on 4 May 2000 might be adjourned. This adjournment was granted by Mr. Justice Johnson on 14 April 2000. In addition, adjournments have been granted for the Easter term High Court sittings in Kilkenny, Limerick and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The granting of this adjournment has provided a period during which a pilot scheme of direct negotiations between the Chief State Solicitor and individual firms of solicitors representing plaintiffs has been initiated. The object of this scheme is to settle as many of the claims listed for this term as is possible without recourse to the courts. Progress will be subject of review in early June.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to the Law Society for the role it has played in the establishment of this pilot scheme. There will, of course continue, to be ongoing communication between the Chief State Solicitor's office and plaintiffs' solicitors as the settlement process advances.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing developments, I do not consider that the establishment of a formal compensation tribunal, which would be considerably more costly and slower than direct settlement negotiations, is necessary or warranted at this time. I believe that the Hanley judgment provides a basis whereby the vast majority of existing claims can be settled on terms which are both fair to plaintiffs and to the taxpayer. An out-of-court settlement scheme should also provide a speedy method of dealing with outstanding claims with a significant reduction in legal costs. If the pilot scheme is judged successful it will, of course, be continued and extended.</P>
    <P>There are 9,357 hearing loss cases outstanding at present including 216 new cases lodged in the past three months. Some 917 cases have been settled in 2000 at a cost of £6.665 million. Legal costs have been paid in respect of 126 of these settled cases at a cost of £0.690 million.</P>
    <P>In total, £81.343 million in damages and £31.165 million in legal costs have been paid in respect of hearing loss cases to date.</P>
    <P>A total of 35 cases of post traumatic stress syndrome have been lodged to date of which one has been the subject of a court award and two have been settled.</P>

      <P>(i)the injury is fatal, or certified by a medical officer to be of a serious nature; or</P>

      <P>(c)any loss, deficiency, theft, destruction or damage of or to moneys, stores, equipment, clothing, supplies, buildings, vehicles, aircraft, ships, animals, machinery or other articles which are the property of the Minister or are in the custody of the Defence Forces or which are the property, or in the custody, of service mess, institute or canteen;</P>

    <P>(g)any other matter which a convening authority considers necessary to have investigated by a court of inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Courts of Inquiry are internal inquiries convened by a convening authority for the purposes of inquiring into any matter which may be referred to them and to make such finding or declaration as may be required. The purpose of such inquiries is to allow the convening authority to take such action as he may deem necessary in relation to the subject matter of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the regulations provides that &ldquo;the findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry shall be treated as confidential. They shall not be disclosed to interested parties, except as provided in subsection 181(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 ....&rdquo;. This section of the Defence Act refers to a situation where a court of inquiry is held prior to trial by court-martial.</P>
    <P>In addition, accidents involving personnel serving with the United Nations overseas are investigated by UN boards of inquiry. The reports of such boards of inquiry are the property of the United Nations and cannot be made available publicly. Defence Force Regulations C.S. 5 (New Series) &ndash; A Contingent Of The Permanent Defence Force Serving with An International United Nations Force &ndash; provides at paragraph 6 that a court of inquiry shall not be held into any matter relating to a contingent unless otherwise directed by the Chief of Staff or Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; Support. Such a direction would be given, for example, where the United Nations board of inquiry failed to address some national matter or where a national matter required further inquiry.</P>

      <P>A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident which occurred at Kilworth Firing Range on 9 December 1997 in which five Defence Forces personnel were injured, one seriously. The inquiry encompassed the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry. Weapons handling training on the 60mm <Col N="693" /> mortar continued but live firing for training purposes ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations. The report submitted to higher military authority gave rise to additional queries which could only be addressed by the reconvening of the court of inquiry and this was done. The report of the reconvened court of inquiry was submitted to me on the 10 August last.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 11 of Defence Force Regulations A.5 &ndash; Courts of Inquiry provides that &ldquo;the findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry shall be treated as confidential.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the report of the court of inquiry will not be made public.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House however, that all drills and procedures as well as all other aspects of firing exercises are kept constantly under review by the military authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 81 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As one might reasonably expect, members of the Permanent Defence Force, across all ranks, take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this would also apply to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general PDF <Col N="694" /> situation. The PDF pension schemes are amongst the most generous within the Public Service. For instance, an enlisted man or non-commissioned officer can retire with an immediate pension and retirement lump sum after some 21 years service, often implying a real potential for retirement at about age 40.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the case of commissioned officers, a pension is payable, along with a lump sum after the completion of 12 years military service. For example, an officer, such as an Army captain or commandant, may retire from the PDF in his or her late 30s and immediately receive a military pension along with a retirement lump sum.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. This always applied across a wide range of traditional trades, such as electrical work and vehicle mechanics. Nowadays, however, military skills training is as likely to encompass well recognised courses of training as electronics and communications technicians and also qualifications in computer software and information technology. Many military personnel, in all ranks, are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and indeed to post graduate degree level in such readily marketable specialisms. Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector. The military authorities are aware of such individual personnel being actively head-hunted by private sector employers.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the temporary and &lsquo;once off' nature of the former voluntary early retirement scheme, under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan over the years 1996-98, it should be noted that the demographic age structure within the PDF is such that a considerable number of personnel, whether serving as commissioned officers or as other ranks, are now at a stage in their careers when they can retire and thus avail of the terms of their respective statutory pension and lump sum entitlements, on the basis of accumulated years of past service. That this phenomenon coincides with an unprecedented degree of economic prosperity and employment opportunity in the private labour market will continue to challenge the senior management of the Defence Forces for some years to come.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,061 boardings were carried out by Naval Service personnel during the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. The new patrol vessel, the <i>LE Róisín</i>, was commissioned on 15 December 1999 <Col N="702" /> and became operational immediately thereafter. I signed the contract for the provision of a second new ship for the Naval Service at the Naval Base, Haulbowline on 6 April 2000. The placing of the contract is a further step in the implementation of the Government's commitment to the modernisation of the service. The new vessel, which will replace <i>LE Deirdre</i>, will join the Naval Service fleet on fishery protection duties following delivery in the latter part of next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 77 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware Ireland joined Partnership for Peace (PfP) on 1 December 1999. The areas of interest to Ireland in Partnership for Peace are set out in the Presentation Document which was approved by Dáil Éireann on 9 November 1999 and which was presented to the NATO secretariat upon signature by Ireland of the PfP Framework Document on 1 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of its Presentation Document Ireland will develop, in consultation with the NATO Secretariat, an individual partnership programme which will cover a two year period initially and which will set out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training and exercises and inter-operability in peacekeeping operations. It will be recalled that participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities. Arrangements are currently being put in place to advance the development of Ireland's individual partnership programme. This two year programme will be developed having regard to the State's requirements in relation to the roles of the Defence Forces as set out in the White Paper on Defence and taking account of resource implications. The White Paper sets out a comprehen<Col N="703" /> sive strategy for the management and development of defence over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever activities with which they may tasked from time <Col N="704" /> to time. In this regard participation in PfP does not involve the imposition of any changes in Defence Forces training procedures and equipment.</P>
    <P>Invitations to the following PfP exercises have been received and accepted to date this year:</P>

      <Quest>if the Naval Service have received any reports in recent weeks about intimidation, from Irish skippers regarding the activities of Spanish and French trawlers within the Irish economic zone as reported in a national newspaper (details supplied) on 9 May 2000; and, if so, the action taken.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Naval Service received notification from the Irish Coast Guard on 2 May 2000 of an incident involving the alleged harassment of the Irish fishing vessel the <i>Martha David</i> by the French fishing vessel the <i>Magdeleine</i> off the south west coast. The<i> LE Ciara </i>proceeded to the scene and Naval Service personnel boarded both vessels. Statements were taken from the skippers and these have been forwarded to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for further action. The Naval Service has stated that there was no damage to property or injury to any person as a result of this incident.</P>
      <P>The present position in so far as the Naval Service is concerned is that its powers are restricted to inspection, investigation and detention in cases where there are suspected breaches of fisheries legislation e.g. log-book infringements, etc. Where incidents such as harassment of fishing vessels at sea are reported, a Naval Service vessel is deployed to the scene to investigate. As the Naval Service has no powers to police such incidents, action by Naval Service personnel is confined to the taking of statements from the skippers of the relevant fishing vessels, or alternatively, reporting on such incidents if the Naval Service was present at the time the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has recently announced that he will shortly bring forward a proposal to Government on draft legislation to give effect to Article 101, relating to piracy, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to protect fishermen from harassment and intimidation. This is designed to enable the State, through the Naval Service, to arrest vessels for breaches of UNCLOS Article 101. It is envisaged that the proposed new legislation will empower the Naval Service to detain, escort into port and hand over to the Garda authorities any vessel involved in harassment or intimidation, both inside and outside the 12 mile limit.</P>

The Chief State Solicitor is in the process of preparing contracts of sale for these 86 houses. The contracts will be issued as soon as possible to the solicitors acting on behalf of the purchasers. At this stage it is anticipated that the vast bulk of the sales will be completed between September and the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 86 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>A number of approaches have been made in recent times by private concerns regarding the possible commercial use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending use of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for such use. However, the greater utilisation of this under used resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> The use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with me in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard the recent report to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance on the future of Aer Rianta considered the possibility of a second airport in the Dublin area and this was considered in the context of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>This report which was made by Warburg Dillon Read/AIB on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Their recommendations will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and I will report to Government with specific recommendations on the future of Baldonnel. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what these recommendations will be.</P>
    <P>A consultants' report commissioned by the Department on air safety including training and operational requirements of the Air Corps at Casement Aerodrome has been received. The report made by Sir Frederick Snow and Partners is currently being examined. There are not any plans to publish the report at this time.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>The minimum height requirement for both males and females had previously been set at 5' 5&rdquo;. However, in March 1998, I reduced the height requirement for female applicants for general enlistment in the Defence Forces to 5' 4&rdquo; in light of the natural height differential between males and females and to encourage an increased participation by women in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am in favour of retaining the reduced height requirement for women, I must however <Col N="707" /> be mindful of the professional advice of the Medical Corps, and the actual experience of training units, that persons of shorter stature encounter difficulties in carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment. Therefore, I do not envisage any further lowering of height requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo;, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year. This would roughly equate to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>What Helsinki agreed upon was a capabilities target and as the Helsinki European Council conclusions make clear, this does not imply the creation of a European army. Nor does it alter the fact that participation in the Petersberg tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council at the meeting of 20 March 2000, which I attended together with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, considered the way forward for elaborating the headline and capability goals set at Helsinki.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers of the 15 member states of the EU, was tasked at Helsinki to progress the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which the target could be met and maintained and progress reviewed.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council identified the process for further elaborating the headline and capability goals in the perspective of a capabilities pledging conference to be convened by the end of 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what contribution Ireland can make will be considered in the context of this process taking account of the voluntary and case <Col N="708" /> by case nature of Petersberg Tasks, current overseas commitments and security requirements at home.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published White Paper on Defence which is the first such paper to be produced in this country. One of its objectives was to set out the basis for the future development of Civil Defence policy and the follow-up to the &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; programme on Civil Defence launched in 1992. As I said in my message in the White Paper, the organisation provides a unique opportunity for people to give voluntary service within their own communities. It will continue to be developed as a top-class provider of second line emergency services through the local authority structure.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that the Civil Defence mission should continue to be to facilitate, through the local authorities, Civil Defence responses for emergency relief and support to ensure the operation of vital services and the maintenance of public life and to provide other community supports as directed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The necessary management and development processes to improve performance and increase effectiveness are currently being put in place. I propose to bring forward a new Civil Defence Bill which will be published in the autumn.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 87 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for giving me this opportunity to inform the House of the latest position on implementation of the White Paper on Defence. Implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively. The most important element of this is the organisation and resourcing of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for the management and development of defence for the next decade. The Government has fulfilled its commitment in An Action Plan for the Millennium to define a long-term strategy for defence. This strategy includes a major new £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This will ensure we have a modern and sustainable defence organisation with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
      <P>The final text of the White Paper on Defence was available very shortly after its approval by Government on 29 February 2000. The final text has been available on my Department's website for the past two months and a full-colour printed version of the White Paper has been available for sale from early May 2000.</P>
      <P>In accordance with paragraph 4.3.17 of the White Paper, I recently directed the chief of staff to draw up a draft implementation plan for my consideration and approval which will give effect to the organisational elements of the White Paper. I advised the chief of staff that I considered it is important that the draft plan adopt a long-term view of Permanent Defence Force organisation to reflect the ten year time frame of the White Paper. The new organisation as set out in the White Paper will be based upon an overall PDF manpower which will not exceed 10,500 with the option of an additional 250 recruits in training.</P>
      <P>The proposed plan should also provide for the maintenance of existing barracks and should be broadly consistent with the proposals on the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force set out in Chapter 5 of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the ten year timeframe for the White Paper the draft plan will address the broad goals set out in paragraph 4.3.19 of the White Paper, namely: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present, and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>I have asked the chief of staff to submit a draft plan to me by the end of June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important element of the White Paper is the reallocation of resources to improved equip<Col N="710" /> ment and infrastructure. I have already announced decisions on major new equipment programmes which are a key element of White Paper implementation.</P>
    <P>Air Corps capabilities will be augmented through a special £55 million investment programme over the next three years, with the procurement of new helicopters being given special priority.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service vessel replacement programme has already commenced with the planned acquisition of a second new state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the <i>LE Róisín</i> at a cost of some £20 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, I announced a multi-million pound investment programme for the Army, worth an estimated £25 million over the next three years. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. This equipment will be of considerable benefit to the Army in carrying out its roles at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>This means that I have announced investment in new equipment totalling at least £100 million in addition to the £40 million already set aside for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers. Investment of this scale confirms that the White Paper represents a serious response by the Government to a sustained case advanced by the military authorities to develop the Defence Forces into a world-class military organisation and we have allocated the funding that this ambitious project will require.</P>
    <P>Other implementation initiatives and measures will be rolled out over time. I will keep the House informed of these as they arise. My overall objective is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces that it needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument Number 205 of 1997, Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, namely, a principal inspector from the UK air accidents investigation branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish armed forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent such future accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned statutory instrument, I, together with other relevant parties, including the families, received on 10 May 2000 a copy of the draft final report. A period of 28 days is provided within which representations may be furnished. In the meantime, the contents of the draft report are to be treated as confidential as prescribed by regulation.</P>
      <P>The final report of the investigation will be made public. The regulations provide that the final report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. Therefore, the work of the military court of inquiry will proceed following publication of the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit. The court of inquiry must also await the Coroner's Court findings. I am informed that the coroners court is adjourned until mid-July next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>Since January 2000 there have been 78 firings close to UNIFIL IRISHBATT positions. The most serious of these incidents occurred on 21-22 April following an attack by armed elements on a <i>de facto</i> forces compound south of Haddathah. In the course of retaliation by the Israeli Defence Forces&ndash;<i>de facto </i>forces, IRISHBATT position 6-38 suffered eight firings close in the space of 18 minutes. One of these close firings was a direct impact by a mortar inside position 6-38 causing shrapnel damage to several accommodation units and another involved direct impacts by five rounds of heavy machine gun on the roof of an accommodation block inside position 6-38. At my request the Department of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Israeli Ambassador on 3 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me as Minister for Defence and to the Government. While absolute guarantees cannot be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions such as UNIFIL, it is my policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training. Each post within the Irish UNIFIL Area of Operations has reinforced concrete bunkers specifically designed to withstand direct and indirect fire from heavy weapons. Rigorous operational procedures are in place to ensure that personnel occupy these bunkers in a timely fashion should the need arise. In such eventuality, minimum duty personnel remain in place, protected, to ensure that operational activity is observed and reported.</P>
      <P>Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved. Irish troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the current situation in South Lebanon is assessed as calm. The situation, however, continues to be volatile. The Defence Forces will continue to monitor the situation, particularly in the light of the stated Israeli intention to withdraw from South Lebanon by 7 July 2000. The emerging developments are being followed closely by the United Nations. Ireland and other UNIFIL troop contributing countries are considering, in consultation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York, the implications of a number of scenarios attendant on Israeli withdrawal. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently met the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Louise Frechette and senior officials of the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Political Affairs to discuss developments. The Minister emphasised the absolute priority the Government attaches to the safety <Col N="715" /> and security of our troops. He was assured by the Deputy Secretary-General that the UN shares our concerns for the safety and security of all UN personnel in South Lebanon.</P>
    <P>The UN is engaged in contingency planning for the post-withdrawal situation and the Secretary-General's special envoy has just returned from a fact-finding visit to the region. He will report to the Security Council in the coming days and the indications are that UNIFIL will continue to play a crucial role in the period immediately following the Israeli withdrawal.</P>
    <P>The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the United Nations Security Council every six months following a report by the Secretary General of the United Nations. UN Security Council Resolution 1288 of 31 January 2000 extended the mandate of UNIFIL for a further period of six months, i.e. until 31 July 2000.</P>
    <P>On 4 April 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL comprising approximately 620 personnel all ranks for a six month period beginning 19 April 2000. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond July, 2000 in the event of a further extension of the UNIFIL mandate.</P>
    <P>During my visit to the Middle East from 14-19 March, I reiterated my concern for the safety of Irish troops in the event of a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli Forces from the Israeli occupied area in South Lebanon at meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister Dr. Selim Hoss, and the Lebanese Chief of Staff and Commander in Chief of the Lebanese Army, General Michel Suleyman.</P>

      <P>Proposals are currently being formulated by the military authorities for maximising the effectiveness and efficiency of Naval Service ships and ships' companies on patrolling duties. All eight naval vessels are operational and the military authorities advise that current operational commitments are being met.</P>
      <P>With regard to staffing levels, there are eight officers and 12 cadets undergoing training for watchkeeping certificates. In January this year, nine non-commissioned personnel started a two year course with a view to being commissioned as watchkeeping officers. A competition for direct entry watchkeeping officers is under way and assessment of current applications is nearing conclusion. There are currently five cadets and four officers undergoing training as marine engineer officers. Proposals for a direct entry competition for marine engineer officers are currently being considered and are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The cadet competition for this year is also under way and it is anticipated that 16 Naval Service cadetships will be offered.</P>
      <P>Two non-commissioned personnel were commissioned as Naval Service electrical engineer officers in November last. One non-commissioned officer was commissioned in March to fill an information technology appointment. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the ongoing recruitment process.</P>
      <P>The present policy of ongoing recruitment for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address the question of any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. In 1999, a total of 97 general service recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service under the general recruitment campaign. A further general service recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces in respect of the year 2000 was advertised recently.</P>
      <P>The proposed schedule for the intake of recruits for the Naval Service for 2000 is as follows: April, 20 to 30 recruits; September, 40 recruits; and December, 40 recruits.</P>
      <P>Thirty seven recruits completed training on 6 April 2000.</P>
      <P>There are currently 45 apprentices in training as follows: engine room artificers, 19; shipwrights, six; radio/radar technicians, seven; and electrical artificer, 13.</P>
      <P>Proposals for an intake of apprentices in 2000 are being considered. A total of £165,000 has been allocated for recruitment advertising for the year 2000. The military authorities have had responsibility for the advertising budget since the launch of the White Paper on Defence on 29 February 2000. The administrative details relating to this delegation are now being finalised. Essentially, the military authorities now have responsibility for the allocation and deployment of funds for recruitment advertising.</P>

      <Quest>the year when the issue of the use of St. Bricin's Military Hospital by non-military patients was first considered; the year when agreement in principle was reached; the developments recently to maximise the benefits accruing from the use of St. Bricin's by non-military patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible use of St. Bricin's Military Hospital for civilian patients was first mooted in late 1997, following contacts between military medical staff and the Mater Hospital. Agreement in principle was reached in 1998 between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on a proposal to use St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into <Col N="718" /> which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred from the Mater Hospital.  It was agreed that, initially, a pilot scheme would be set up under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If this pilot scheme proved successful, the intention would be to enter into a long-term arrangement for accommodating up to 20 civilian patients at a time at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has overall responsibility for the proposal. Accordingly, before any pilot scheme can commence, it is essential that the Department of Health and Children has fully satisfied itself with regard to all the arrangements surrounding the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients in St. Bricin's Hospital. I am informed that proposals made by the Mater Hospital to the Department of Health and Children with regard to the use of St. Bricin's Hospital for civilian patients are under examination by that Department's chief medical officer. While it is accepted by that Department that the proposals have merit, a number of important issues still require clarification to ensure that patients are best served at all times. The Department of Health and Children remains in communication concerning these issues. When the Department of Health and Children have reached their required level of clarification, they will be in a position to make a decision on the matter. A number of complex legal and insurance issues will also need to be resolved by the Department of Health and Children prior to the commencement of the pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 March, 2000 the new Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) is the statutory body with responsibility for health and personal social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The ERHA is currently examining the accident and emergency services in their region with a view to bringing forward recommendations to improve services and address existing deficiencies. The proposals for St. Bricin's Hospital will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
      <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the proposed arrangements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's Hospital provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible. There is, however, no further action which can be taken by my Department on this proposal at present until the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the proposed arrangements.</P>

Ireland is an observer at the Western European Union. While representatives of Western European Union observer states, including Ireland, sit in the assembly and on its committees, they are not entitled to vote. I understand that the assembly, meeting at Lisbon in March, decided to invite the five Western European Union observer nations to participate in the assembly's debates, with delegations composed in the same way as those of Western European Union full members. My understanding is that invitations have been extended directly to the parliaments of the five Western European Union observer nations, including Ireland.</P>

      <P>The reason for the delay in processing this complaint is evident from the letter to which the Deputy refers, that is the resource constraints which the authority is <Col N="721" /> currently experiencing.

      <P>I am always striving to improve the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts to ensure it continues to meet both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Major strides have been made in recent years in bringing the quality of resources, readiness, training and management up to a level in Ireland that is second to none in Europe at present. The Irish Coast Guard, a division of my Department, has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport. These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. The Coast Guard has 65 full-time staff and over 600 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination-communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner, and Waterford, the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and seven community inshore Rescue Service boats based in strategic locations. It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the gardaí and their divers and the UK Coastguard <Col N="723" /> and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation. In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs assist in searches and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved. Stockpiles of anti-pollution equipment are retained for use in the event of an oil pollution incident.</P>
    <P>We are constantly assessing the case, based on risk assessment by location, for improving resources. We are also undertaking a major programme of re-equipment and refurbishment of facilities available to Coast Guard volunteers and I can assure the House that I am responding positively in all cases where it is made clear to us that the provision of new facilities and the re-equipment and up-grading of existing facilities will add to our capacity to save lives at sea.</P>
    <P>A departmental group, modelled on the principles of partnership and consisting of staff, unions and management has commenced the assessment of the recent IMES expenditure review including the recommendations concerning a coast guard and will identify the necessary organisational and service delivery changes which might arise with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has in recent times progressed a number of initiatives to address issues relating to seafarer training and employment in the maritime sector.</P>
      <P>A task force on seafarer training and employment, representative of shipowners and operators, educational and training agencies, industry and trade unions and specialists from Government Departments, was established in February, 1998, by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. It is critically examined current shortages of skilled seafarers, the potential of the maritime sector to deliver more jobs and the capacity/deficiencies of the existing educational framework for seafarer training.</P>
      <P>The December 1998 final report of the task force recommended the establishment of a new national maritime college. It endorsed a joint proosal by the Cork Institute of Technology and the Naval Service for a combined civil and naval service national maritime college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The Government last week approved the establishment at Ringaskiddy in Cork of a new £30 million national maritime college. The new college will be a state-of-the-art centre of excellence for maritime training, capable of meeting Ireland's seafarer training needs into the future. The establishment of the college will maintain existing employment for Irish seafarers; increase the number of trained seafarers; provide options for the expansion of maritime related employment in Ireland; capture the opportunity presented by the growing deficiency in the supply of skilled seafarers internationally, and, act as a centre of excellence capable of attracting young people to choose careers at sea, at a time when the international maritime sector is poised for rapid expansion to accommodate international trade and ship based tourism operations.</P>
    <P>In part because of the development of the new college, qualified seafarers will be available to fill key executive and management positions in our commercial seaports and fishery harbours, as port managers and executives, harbour masters and pilots, and they will bring new skills to bear on our expanding shore based maritime services sector and to servicing the lucrative international shipping and shipping services sector.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present consulting all the players in the shipping sector, including the Irish Chamber of Shipping, the representative bodies for shipbrokers, ship agents and master mariners, to consider how the new college can best meet their educational and professional training needs.</P>
    <P>The maritime college initiative will complement the recent establishment of the Irish Marine Development Office within the Marine Institute, to position Ireland to secure new jobs in shipping and shipping services. The new office will also promote Ireland abroad as an attractive centre for ship registration and for locating specialist marine related services in the same way that the IDA promotes Ireland as a location for investment in other sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>The IMDO's remit covers seafarer training. That office will ensure that no employment opportunities in the maritime sector are lost. To that end the Government will address those issues in the educational, fiscal or regulatory environment required to grow Ireland's maritime sector.</P>
    <P>Regarding the availability of qualified pilots, the position is that pilotage authorities, including certain port companies, are responsible for employing-licensing pilots within their jurisdictional area. My Department has received no reports of any shortage of suitably qualified personnel from any authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The public service obligation levy is intended to be imposed on final customers and not on generators and therefore, the question of a threshold of 25 megawatts in respect of generators producing electricity primarily for their own combined heat and power needs, such as the company referred to by the Deputy, does not arise.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently preparing a notification to the European Commission in relation to a public service obligation to be imposed on the ESB in its function as public electricity supplier. This public service obligation relates to the use of peat and renewable/sustainable generation for reasons of security of supply and environmental protection respectively.</P>
      <P>It is likely to take the European Commission a number of months to process the notification, following which I will make a public service obligation order under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. This order will provide for, among other things, a public service obligation levy on final customers in respect of the additional cost to the public electricity supplier of purchasing electricity under the public service obligation. I would like to reiterate that the levy is on final customers and not on the generation of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> The rationale behind the recovery of the public service obligation levy from all customers, including customers of independent suppliers as well as customers of the public electricity supplier, is because to do otherwise would be discriminatory and would distort competition. It would provide an artificial incentive for customers to leave the public electricity supplier for independent suppliers, irrespective of their relative underlying costs of supply and would accordingly, also lead to inefficiency and higher costs of electricity overall.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it would be unjustifiable to have a bias in the levy arrangements in favour of one form of generation over another. It would be discriminatory not to charge the levy on the consumption of users who happen to have a generator on-site as against those who do not.</P>

      <P>The statement to which the Deputy refers was not authorised and represents only the personal view of the individual concerned. The officer concerned appeared to be under a mistaken perception regarding the time taken to rebuild a gymnasium in the barracks in question. The Deputy may be interested to the know that until quite recently the building of the gymnasium had not been identified by military authorities, to me or my immediate predecessors, as a matter of priority. During the period in question significant funds were invested in other building projects in accordance with the priorities identified.</P>
      <P>I have received and accepted an apology from the officer's superiors and regard the matter as closed. Any further action relating to the statement made by the officer is solely a matter for the military authorities. I understand the chief of staff has taken the opportunity to draw to the attention of senior officers his concerns that speeches at such events should be appropriate to the occasion.</P>

    <P>The two subheads comprise expenditure relating to equipment acquisition as well as maintenance, up-grading and operational costs. As regards year <Col N="728" /> on year comparison of the amounts it should be noted that some re-arrangement of the content of subheads may have been necessary during the period for accounting purposes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the context of considering the White Paper on Defence the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
    <P>Last month, I signed a contract for the construction of a further ship for the Naval Service, similar to <i>LE Róisín. </i>In addition, in recognition of the urgent equipment modernisation requirements of the Air Corps I announced on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps under the direction of the high level civil-military planning and procurement group which, as indicated in the White Paper, will be tasked with the development of a new plan to address Defence Forces' equipment needs over a five-year timeframe. This substantial funding for the Air Corps in the short-term will ensure that the Air Corps is ready and equipped to carry out different taskings as required.</P>
    <P>The savings arising from the restructuring of the Defence Forces are estimated at £20 million per year &ndash; a total of £200 million over the ten year period covered by the White Paper. Together with the revenue of at least £50 million expected from the sale of the six barracks, this will result in a level of investment in the Defence Forces which will ensure that the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are fully equipped with the most modern equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service has a general responsibility to meet Ireland's contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. As mentioned in the recent White <Col N="730" /> Paper on Defence, the Government has decided that the Naval Service will be developed around the provision of an eight ship flotilla. On a day to day basis, the main activity of the Naval Service, amounting to over 90% of its operations, is the provision of fishery protection services in co-operation with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which has primary responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service to carry out its roles. In December 1999, the <i>LE Róisín</i> was commissioned and is now active on fishery protection patrols. Last month, I signed a contract for the construction of a further vessel, similar to <i>LE Róisín</i> which is expected to be completed in the latter half of next year. The second new ship will replace <i>LE Deirdre</i> as it approaches the end of its economic life. The total cost of these vessels will represent investment of about £44 million. Older vessels of the fleet have been extensively overhauled as part of an ongoing programme in recent years and this programme will be completed this year with the refit of <i>LE Ciara</i> and <i>LE Orla</i>.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. As already mentioned, the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the customs service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
      <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the importation of illegal drugs are concerned. In this regard, the White Paper on Defence does not envisage any change in the role of the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>There were only 28 apprentices at the Army Apprentice School in Devoy Barracks, Naas, at the time of closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology for the purpose of completing their final off the job training module which consisted of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices were variously training as motor mechanics, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January 1999 and completed it at the end of March 1999.</P>
      <P>The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics-commmunications, are located in the School of Signals on the Curragh. They will complete their technical training in the middle of the year 2001.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the average cost of training an apprentice at the former Army Apprentice School had reached the level of £100,000 per annum. This was clearly quite unsustainable.</P>
      <P>When the closure of the Army Apprentice School was announced, I gave an undertaking that every apprentice would be given the opportunity to complete their training. I am informed by the military authorities that the new arrangements with Dublin Institute of Technology worked very satisfactorily and that the standard of instruction provided was excellent. As promised, all of the Army apprentices either have already completed, or are continuing on to complete, their apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS, Dublin Institute of Technology and-or regional technical college courses for their formal off the job training. This type of format for training is already the long established situation with all Naval Service apprentices. The distinct apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are all kept under regular review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited to the various branches of the Defence Forces, for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to identified service needs. There are no proposals on hand from the military authorities for the open recruitment of further apprentices to the Army at present.</P>

      <P>In July 1999, the Government decided to extend the scope of the Act further over the subsequent 24 months to certain other bodies in the areas of broadcasting, social services, health, culture, environment, regulation, enterprise and education. The first phase of this extension took place on 1 May 2000 when RTE and TG4 were brought within the scope of the Act. The Irish Red Cross is not included among the list of bodies to be brought within the scope of FOI over the next 12 months. However, the inclusion of the Irish Red Cross in future extensions of the FOI Act to other public bodies will be considered in consultation with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>The taxpayer's income tax liability for 1999-00 has been recalculated on the basis of adjustments made to his tax-free allowances in the light of (i) and (ii) as outlined, and the position is that he has a small under payment for the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Electricity is subject to VAT at the 12.5% rate and in this regard, Ireland avails of certain options for reduced rating contained in EU VAT law. Telephone bills are standard rated at 21%. <Col N="736" /> It is not open to me to zero rate the supply of such services and these rates must apply regardless of the user of the service. Therefore, it is not open to me to remove VAT from either telephone or electricity services supplied to elderly people.</P>

For those in receipt of the Free Electricity Allowance, this covers the normal standing charge and provides 1500 free units, i.e., 200 units per two-monthly billing period in the summer and 300 units per two monthly period in the winter. In addition, it is possible to use the £5 fuel allowance, which is payable from October to April to cover electricity charges.

        <i>Action Plan for the Information Society</i>The central objective of the Action Plan for the Information Society, which was approved by Government in July 1999, was to make Ireland one of the leaders in the emerging information society. The plan identified a number of key initiatives and assigned specific responsibility to a number of Departments for their achievement. These include,<i> inter alia</i>, initiatives to improve <Col N="737" /> access and to address social inclusion (Taoiseach); electronic delivery of integrated public services (Taoiseach, Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs (Reach); and the introduction of electronic procurement across all of the public service (Finance).</P>
      <P>
        <i>Access for All</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The provision of access opportunities for the population who do not have PCs is a key aim. Alternative suggestions have been supported such as access points in libraries, schools, new government buildings etc. A new cross-organisation committee is being set up by the Department of the Taoiseach to give fresh consideration to access problems. Commitments on improved access have also been given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Reach</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Working out the details behind the service model and procuring the technology to support the new electronic public services are the primary objectives of the Reach Cross-Departmental Unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs (DSCFA). It is envisaged that the unit will be in a position to procure portal services early in 2001. It will also decide the candidate episodes for early implementation in 2001. Reach's programme of work is on a critical path and it has to carry out a large programme of work to a tight timescale.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Action Plan Funding</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The Centre for Management Development and Organisation (CMOD) in my Department administers the Action Plan Fund (£30 million for 2000) and chairs the team that evaluates project proposals from Departments and offices. A number of requests for funding have been received and approved so far this year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>E-Procurement</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>E-procurement by public service agencies has been identified by IBEC and Forfás as being key to the wider implementation of electronic commerce in Ireland. It has the potential for significantly reducing procurement costs in public sector agencies through: bulk buying discounts, reduced administrative overheads, and further improving and standardising procurement practices in agencies. An interdepartmental committee, chaired by procurement section in my Department, has been charged with procuring and implementing an electronic procurement facility for the public service, which will provide; facilities for the publication of procurement opportunities; providing downloadable tender documentation; publication of results of procurement competitions; documentation on general procurement requirements; and facilities for on-line submission of tenders.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Next Steps</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A key requirement to the provision of electronic services is provision of the necessary telecommunications infrastructure for all sectors of <Col N="738" /> government. Work is at a very advanced stage in this process.</P>
    <P>The provision of electronic services is a three year programme. This year 2000 is key to preparing the groundwork in developing the telecommunications infrastructure; ensuring the required legislation is in place; setting up the relevant bodies and committees; and years two and three, (2001 and 2002 will see the delivery of business solutions which will facilitate members of the public conducting their dealings with Government Departments in an integrated way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of health related support services for children and adults with autism is the responsibility of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. These services include assessment, early intervention services, outreach services provided by multidisciplinary support teams, day, residential and respite services. While new additional services specifically for persons with autism have been and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the intellectual disability services and have benefited generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services which have been substantially enhanced in recent years. However, the Government recognised that there was a need to accelerate the pace at which the identified needs of persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability were being met and is committed to meeting those needs within a defined timeframe of three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment, both capital and revenue, this year.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding being allocated in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. The services being provided with this funding include the development and enhancement of health related support services for persons with autism. Additional capital funding amounting to £80 million is being made available over the three year period 2000 to 2002 to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to approximately £5 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and outreach services for children of school going age <Col N="739" /> with autism. These services are provided by multidisciplinary support teams and include the provision of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychological and social work support services. The multidisciplinary teams work closely with the parents and families of children with autism to address their needs. The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with autism, is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. In recent years there has been a significant expansion of these services and my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science to provide health related support services to school going children with autism. Both Departments will continue to work together to address the needs of these children.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department are currently liaising with the health boards in relation to the information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons with autism and I will forward this to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey referred to by the Deputy has not been submitted to my Department and therefore I am not in a position to comment on its findings. However, I am aware that many patients attending accident and emergency departments with non-urgent ailments experience long waiting times before receiving treatment. It is important to note that while patients may experience delays in accident and emergency departments, every effort is made by the staff to keep these delays to a minimum and to ensure that appropriate medical treatment is provided to all patients at all times.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in recent years significant additional funding has been allocated to hospitals providing accident and emergency services. I have provided additional funding of £2 million this year to enable the hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing difficulties experienced by accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving accident and emergency services and in this regard officials in my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, are examining measures aimed at reducing lengthy waiting times in such departments.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Dublin Corporation and other local authorities are seeking to address the housing crisis by purchasing from senior citizens their homes at market value minus the deduction in turn for housing them in senior citizen accommodation; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that a major difficulty is now arising because of the fear of senior citizens that they will lose their medical cards or other means tested entitlements; if he will amend the medical card guidelines so that the proceeds of the sale of their house in these circumstances be exempted from any means test under his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is aware that Dublin Corporation operates a financial scheme whereby elderly home owners offer their houses for sale to the corporation at a discounted price based on their age &ndash; one third of market value between 60 and 69 years, one quarter between 70 and 79 years and one fifth over 80 years. The vendor is then provided with rented senior citizen accommodation. The scheme allows senior citizens to move to accommodation better suited to their needs. I understand that more than 200 senior citizens have availed of the scheme since 1988.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to liaise with Dublin Corporation in relation to this scheme with a view to allaying any fears older people may have regarding its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the <Col N="744" /> appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>Any investments or savings that could or should generate an income are taken into account in assessing income for medical card purposes. Interest from savings is taken into account but after that it is general practice to disallow a modest amount of savings when assessing the amount of savings/assets which could be redeemed as an income.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.</P>

    <P>The most recent recruitment campaign within the Eastern Regional Health Authority in respect of public health nurses is almost complete and staff will be assigned to the three area health boards within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The higher diploma in public health nursing is offered on a calendar year, full-time basis in both University College, Cork, and University College, Dublin. There are 60 places in all between both locations and all places are filled. In this context, the level of sponsorship is not an issue affecting the availability of public health nurses. My Department is currently examining the possibility of increasing the number of training places.</P>
    <P>While my Department's circular letter number 27/66 provides for the sponsorship of student public health nurses by health boards, there are wide variations between boards with regard to the level of sponsorship. The priority action plan for implementation of the Commission on Nursing report includes a commitment to the &ldquo;Introduction of uniform criteria in relation to the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration education courses, in order to ensure equity&rdquo;. The sponsorship <Col N="746" /> arrangements for student public health nurses will be addressed in this context.</P>

      <P>Section 41 of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, provide for the placement of a child coming into care with relatives of the child by the health board. The relatives receive the same allowances and are entitled to apply for the same discretionary payments from a health board as foster carers with whom children are placed <Col N="748" /> under the terms of the 1991 Act and the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995. In accordance with the regulations the relatives have to apply to the health board and undergo an assessment similar to that which is undertaken by foster carers.</P>
      <P>The issue of allowances and discretionary payments has been raised by the Irish Foster Care Association in recent times and it is one of the issues that is being addressed by the working group on foster care which is due to report later this year. The current level of foster care allowances is £60.25 per week for children under twelve and £73.75 per week for children over twelve. These are due to be increased in July in line with the social welfare increases announced in the budget. An additional increase will also be given in respect of children under 12. In addition, foster parents receive a Christmas bonus in line with social welfare recipients, and a special additional payment of £100 was made in respect of each child in care last Christmas, including foster children and those placed with relatives.</P>

      <P>While section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, provides power, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, to make regulations requiring works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise, this issue is at present dealt with on a case by case basis through environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made on a wide range of grounds to proposed road developments, including the impact of increased noise, and objectors may raise their concerns at a public inquiry. The approval process for road projects, now operated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, but soon to be transferred to An Bord Pleanála can require modifications to be made to the scheme in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> to noise mitigation, and such modifications have been imposed as required.</P>

      <P>I have tabled an amendment to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which provides for the introduction of controls on quarries over five years old. In accordance with the amendment, quarries which have been in existence since before the coming into operation of the Planning and Development Act in October 1964 must register with the planning authority and may be required to undergo environmental impact assessment and apply for planning permission. This will only apply to quarries where the planning authority considers that the continued operation of the quarry would be likely to have significant effects on the environment and, therefore, not all quarries which have been in existence since before October 1964 will have to apply for planning permission. The Planning and Development Bill is currently being debated in Committee.</P>

A tenant or the spouse of a tenant have, of course, protection for their lifetime under the terms of the 1982 Act.</P>
      <P>Over the last six years, the rent tribunal, which sets rent levels for formerly rent controlled dwellings, has dealt with 521 cases in total. If this figure can be used as any sort of guideline then the number of formerly rent controlled tenancies is likely to be relatively small.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, as amended, have devolved to local authorities all significant functions relating to the licensing of taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys and limousines. The regulations also establish criteria which local authorities apply where the number of applications for the grant of taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licences exceeds the number of licences being made available.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are also empowered under the 1995 regulations to determine the fees which may be charged in respect of the application for grant and renewal of public service vehicle licences in their functional area. In the event that a local authority makes no such determination, the regulations establish a default level of fees. The administration of individual taxi licence applications is a matter of the local authorities concerned, and my Department does not have details regarding the circumstances of applicants and other aspects of this process.</P>
      <P>The recent Government initiative to increase the number of Dublin taxis, which temporarily suspended the delegation of certain functions in relation to the Dublin taximeter area, applies fees of £2,500 for the grant of an ordinary taxi licence and £250 for a wheelchair accessible taxi licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the Deputy is referring to means testing and the carer's allowance. The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people who need full time care and attention.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was published in October 1998. The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. One of the issues examined in the course of the review was the means test applied to the carer's allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of the income from employment and other sources. In line with budget 1999 changes which came into effect last August, the first £150 of joint weekly income for married carers is not taken into account in the means test. In the case of single carers, the first £75 of weekly income is disregarded. In addition, PRSI, superannuation, union dues and reasonable travel expenses are deducted from the gross earnings from insurable employment as is £104 per annum in respect of each qualified child.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. It considered that the means test should be maintained as a way of targeting public resources towards those who are most in need. The position and operation of the test will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides <Col N="758" /> income support to carers on low incomes who look after people who need full time care and attention.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of the income from employment and other sources. In line with budget 1999 changes which came into effect last August, the first £150 of joint weekly income for married carers is not taken into account in the means test. In the case of single carers, the first £75 of weekly income is disregarded.</P>
      <P>Mortgage payments are not taken into account in determining means for carer's allowance purposes. The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent or the interest portion of the mortgage, has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate. Therefore if an applicant has means over and above the SWA rate for his family size then the amount of his mortgage interest supplement is reduced £1 for £1 of the increase.</P>
      <P>However, special arrangements were put in place in 1996 for carers which allowed them to have a greater income and still qualify for a mortgage interest supplement. Where the carer is one of a couple the amount disregarded when assessing entitlement is the rate of carer's allowance in payment less the current SWA qualified adult allowance as follows: carers allowance £80.50 &ndash; SWA £47 = £33.50. This amount of £33.50 will be disregarded in the assessment of means for mortgage interest supplement.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under budget 2000 from 6 April 2000, the first £25 a person has from part-time earnings are disregarded in the assessment of means for mortgage interest supplement.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the provision of additional assistance to social welfare recipients by way of disregards in respect of mortgage payments under the means-tested social assistance payments, including the carer's allowance scheme, is considered adequate and will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 1 Feabhra 2000 to his Questions Nos. 253 to 258 and to my reply of 11 Aibreán 2000 to Question No. 349 from another Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have provided a sum of £3 million for this project under the national development plan. Of this, £200,000 has been allocated towards purchasing a site, planning, design work, etc. in the current year.</P>
      <P>Initially six possible sites were identified for the proposed visitor centre. Following a preliminary investigation, three of these sites were considered unsuitable. The owners or their representatives of the three remaining sites have been approached with a view to the possible acquisition of one of them. Negotiations are in progress with the landowners in question and I hope that the matter will be resolved in the near future.</P>

      <P>The process of developing a transaction structure to establish a digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; entity is ongoing. However, as I have already indicated to the House, difficulties have arisen in the process of establishing a DTT entity as originally envisaged. I have been forced to consider alternative approaches with a view to moving the project forward in a manner most likely to achieve the successful establishment of the DTT platform. I have also engaged a facilitator to promote a common understanding of certain issues among RTE, the RTE trade union group &ndash; TUG &ndash; and the RTE network employees likely to transfer to the new DTT entity and to facilitate the presentation of <Col N="760" /> information to me on the positions of these parties. The facilitator's task in this regard is ongoing and his report will be important in informing the development of proposals to move the project forward. A decision on the timing of the issue of the information memorandum to potential investors will be made after the structure of the transaction process has been determined.</P>

      <P>The enforcement of the traffic legislation is a Garda operational matter and I have no statutory function in the matter. However, the concerns of residents regarding heavy goods vehicles travelling on Kennelsfort Road in breach of the three ton limit have been brought to the attention of the Garda national traffic bureau, Garda Headquarters, by my Department for any necessary action.</P>
      <P>The designation of the road in question plus the erection of the three ton limit signs are matters for the local authority concerned, that is, South Dublin County Council and, again, I have no statutory functions in relation to such designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to prosecutions, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there were no prosecutions in 1998 and 2000 to date. In respect of 1999 there were ten prosecutions in <Col N="763" /> respect of breaches of the three ton limit and 25 persons were cautioned for breaches of the three ton limit. The result of these prosecutions is not readily available.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the enforcement of the three ton limit on Kennelsfort Road, Palmerstown, is given a high priority by the Garda. Particular attention is paid to this matter by the community garda for the area, the gardaí from the traffic unit within the division and the gardaí from the traffic department in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>I have been further assured by the Garda authorities that where vehicles are found to be in breach of the regulations appropriate action, including prosecution is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently two psychologists from the national educational psychological service &ndash;  NEPS &ndash; working in County Wicklow. All post-primary schools in the county have access to an educational psychologist, as have a number of primary schools. I am aware that there is a need to increase the number of psychologists in the county to meet the need for educational psychological services and the Deputy will be glad to know that I am currently providing additional posts to expand these services, both in Wicklow and nationally.</P>
      <P>As part of this expansion, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is completing the process of recruiting additional suitably qualified psychologists. As a result, my Department expects to be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year. This will double the present number of psychologists in NEPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to organise NEPS in ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions. The <Col N="764" /> overall allocation of psychologists to regions will be largely based on the projected student numbers in each. In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of psychologists will be shared among the regions on a pro rata basis, until each region has reached its target staffing quota.</P>
    <P>However, within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county that has recently been undertaken by the NEPS psychologists. Among other things, they have investigated the level of access to psychological services apart from NEPS. Any local difficulties will be taken into account in planning for expansion at local level.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's plans, it is envisaged that all schools will have a fully operational psychological service by the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers, and in the current academic year those with grade C in higher level Irish in the Leaving Certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>Primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education but do not possess Grade C in Higher Level Irish will, in the case of those appointed after 1 April 2000, be paid as trained teachers for a period of fourteen weeks after the date of appointment.</P>
      <P>Persons who hold a primary degree may apply for admission to a post graduate course conducted by the primary teacher training colleges.

      <P>Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government assumed office in 1997. It was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999, bringing the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes an increase of 33% over that period. In addition the grant will be increased by a further £11 by the end of the 2000-01 school year. Furthermore, an additional grant of £30 per pupil is paid in respect of all pupils of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from my Department.</P>

All post primary schools in the county <Col N="767" /> have access to the psychological service, as have a number of primary schools. The Deputy will be glad to know that I am providing additional posts to greatly expand this service nationally.</P>
      <P>As part of this expansion, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently completing the process of recruiting additional suitably qualified psychologists. As a result, my Department expects to be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year. This will double the present number of psychologists in NEPS.</P>
      <P>It is planned to organise NEPS in ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions. The overall allocation of psychologists to regions will be largely based on the projected student numbers in each. In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of psychologists will be shared among the regions on a pro rata basis, until each region has reached its target staffing quota.</P>

      <P>Under the information age schools initiative of Eircom, and in co-operation with the Schools IT 2000 initiative of my Department, every recognised school was offered the following at no cost to the school: a telephone line, either ISDN or PSTN; an Internet connection; five hours per week telephone line usage for accessing the internet.</P>
      <P>The provision of the telephone line, whether ISDN or PSTN, took place during early 1998 and was based on the following criteria: availability of connection type; size of school; estimated usage of the line; level of ICT knowledge and activity in the school.</P>
      <P>In response to the success of the schools IT 2000 programme, I am making £81 million available over the next three years for a new and greatly expanded programme. Under this programme every classroom will be connected to the Internet with high-speed access before the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>The pathways through education project involves three inner city schools St Pauls CBS, North Brunswick Street, Presentation Secondary School, Warrenmount and Ringsend Technical Institute. This is an EU funded Youthstart project managed by the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Dublin School Business Partnership. My Department was represented on the steering group for this project which focuses on raising the self-esteem of young people in the participating schools.</P>
      <P>I understand that two of the schools in question are currently participating in the first phase of the stay in school retention initiative at second level launched in June 1999. This Initiative provides funding to targeted schools on the basis of plans that they are being helped to design themselves. The intention is to empower the schools themselves to tackle early school leaving. At the core of the initiative are multi-annual retention plans drawn up by the individual schools and agreed with the Department. These are to provide for a range of specific measures, which can include programmes to assist in the development of self-esteem, directed at the needs of individual schools, together with clear targets in terms of increased retention up to the end of the senior cycle. I intend to invite further schools to participate in the second phase of the initiative shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the schools in question will benefit from: the enhanced guidance service which has a major preventative role in helping young people at risk to stay within the formal education system. Existing provision is being augmented by the creation of a guidance fund of over £4 million which will enable increased guidance provision to be made within second level schools; the expanded national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; which will have 100 educational psychologists in post by the end of this year and 200 by the end of the development phase of the NEPS at the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>The Montessori teachers who are entitled to restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash;  College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas Montessori college, Dún Laoghaire, who have successfully completed the diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Issues related to the training and qualifications of primary school teachers are kept under review. At present the existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed. A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers. The position of all providers of Montessori teachers, including Portobello College, will be examined in the context of the review process.</P>
