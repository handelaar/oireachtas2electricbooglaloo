      <P>I wish to raise under Standing Order 31 the following urgent matter of public importance, namely, the need to restore some level of public confidence in the political process through the introduction of appropriate legislation, including the defamation Bill, and the need for all the Members of the Oireachtas to declare whether they have ever received donations from Mr. Frank Dunlop.</P>

      <P>The driving instructors and the driver testers are two separate issues, but the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was to engage consultants to carry out a review of the organisation and delivery of the driver tester services with particular reference to the requirements to be responsive to and be flexible towards the growing number of people being tested. That review will include full consultation with service users, the staff and other interests. People will have a chance to give their views.

      <P>On the promised legislation which is to be agreed between different parties, will the Taoiseach include the Green Party in the consultation with the other parties on that matter? On the list of promised legislation, the date of publication of No. 65, the defamation Bill, which was raised yesterday, has not changed. It is still scheduled for the end of 2000. Will the Taoiseach give an explanation about the fundraising for charitable and other purposes Bill, which has been expected since 1980? The Bill was laid out in the Costello report. Why is that Bill being put back another year to 2001? Surely in the current climate it would be important to give priority to the area of fund raising for charitable and other purposes. Will the Taoiseach make that a priority rather than relegate it for another year's delay?</P>

      <P>The heads of the defamation Bill, which is to amend the law of defamation drawing on the Law Reform Commission's report and the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, are expected at Cabinet during the summer. I hope the Bill will be published in the autumn. The heads of the fundraising for charitable and other purposes Bill, which is on the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the Costello committee report, are not expected until the autumn. Therefore, it will be published next year. Work is proceeding on the heads as quickly as possible but there are other legislative priorities which are delaying it in that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this issue which is of immense importance in creating a proper health service. My party colleague, Deputy McManus, spoke yesterday evening about how a proper adequate health service could be put in place. In the time available to me, I will direct my comments to the dispute itself.</P>
      <P>The position of non-consultant hospital doctors has for many years been little less than a scandal. It is hard to read in the year 2000 of conditions where a non-consultant hospital doctor, having finished a period in university and training in a hospital, can be in a position of not being able to secure a basic roster for his or her time and service. When one considers the conditions that prevail, a few matters are very clear. First, it is not possible to address this problem without looking at the inadequacy of consultant posts. It is not possible to address the issue without accepting that a career structure must be put in place to enable people to move from NCHD status to consultants. It is not possible to solve this issue on the basis that it is a dispute that has arisen recently or one that can be solved as a short-term labour negotiations problem. The two sides to the dispute, for example, on the health employers side, are not in a position to negotiate on the structure on the basis of the dissatisfaction in the hospitals at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with great care the Minister's speech and there is immense dissatisfaction and anger at the description of non-consultant hospital doctors not being fully trained. They clearly point out, and rightly so, that after the longest period of university lectures, exposure to health training and in-hospital training, they are fully qualified doctors and hope to be on their way to specialist qualification as fully accepted and recognised specialists. The idea that one can lean back and take advantage of what could be described as a kind of class system whereby people who might have aspired to becoming consultants must make themselves available under the most inappropriate conditions is simply unacceptable. It is one of the most disgraceful marks of the European Union, and far more indicative of right-wing thinking within it which wants to destroy the social fabric of employment across the board, that there has been this enormously long waiting period for the implementation of the directive in relation to working time. While there may have been a need in the beginning to consider the supply of essential medical services because of its importance to the public, there is no justification for introducing a period of 13 years, adjusting it to nine years and including no interim points when people might see their hours reduced in the <Col N="9" /> short term. It is impossible to ask people to accept a regime of compulsory, non-rewarded, non-recognised overtime. During this time doctors are not off duty but neither are they being remunerated. The Department of Education and Science could play a part in the resolution of this dispute, by providing additional resources for an improved structure which would enable people to build a professional career from the time of their early recruitment as non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>This dispute, which has been building up over many years, is evidence of a complete erosion of trust. Junior doctors are now being asked to enter into negotiations on one half of the agenda, with the main structural elements left to one side, while at the same time realising that the 1997 contract has not been implemented. If the Minister wishes to enter meaningful talks on any aspect of the problem, the provisions of the 1997 contract should be fully implemented as a gesture of goodwill. The undertakings given on rostering must also be implemented. The Department of Health and Children was to issue a directive to the hospitals in regard to rostering in order that people would know when they would work. My information from people working in the area is that that is not happening in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister state that this dispute can be resolved within the framework of the most recent agreement when the terms of the previous agreements have not been implemented? If the Minister is to be taken seriously at all, he must clear the decks in regard to previous undertakings and deliver on them. He must also make a fundamental commitment to allocate resources, beyond the terms of any negotiations which may occur, to improve structures, increase the number of posts and provide a career structure for transition from non-consultant hospital doctor to consultant status.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he had taken the most benign interpretation possible of the outcome of the EU negotiations on the nine year issue. When we previously had a 13 year proposal, there were also proposals for stage points at which there would be a reduction in hours. If the Minister now accepts a nine year proposal instead of a 13 year one and takes away these stage points, he will extend the period of time rather than reduce it. The Minister may wish to clarify his position on this matter. What could appear to be an improvement would make the situation worse.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to stop talking about the &ldquo;gross cost&rdquo; of the health service. We need a first class health service which will be available to all our citizens. We have real difficulties in recruitment at every level of the health service. Many people are leaving university at an early stage for highly remunerated positions. Students studying medicine make a professional commitment to stay in college longer than others and they then progress to a system which in my time, 30 years ago, displayed more of the characteristics <Col N="10" /> of a caste system than a health professional training system. That must end.</P>
    <P>The only way to bring the non-consultant hospital doctors on side is to agree to implement the terms of the 1997 agenda prior to entering into negotiations. Any entry into negotiations will be an acceptance that only part of the problem is being addressed. Talks must open immediately in regard to putting in place a career structure for junior hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum was established two years ago but has not made a single significant proposal in regard to the structures I have described. How are junior hospital doctors to enter into negotiations as if their dispute was just an ordinary one when the most basic entitlements to time off, knowing what time one is working, what one's career structure is, what proposals for reform are being made and what funding will be provided to implement those are denied them? This is not a little dispute which can be resolved through some kind of administrative adjustment. It has been ripening over a long time and the non-consultant hospital doctors deserve to be taken seriously and to have their dispute resolved.</P>

      <P>This dispute did not arise either today or yesterday. Deputy Higgins is correct in saying that it has been one of the longest festering disputes in the medical services. I have enormous personal sympathy for the plight of non-consultant hospital doctors. Those of us who have been in hospital have seen the contribution made by junior hospital doctors. However, the debate which was initiated last night and which is continuing this morning will not resolve the situation.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister who, in his current and previous positions, has developed a record for conciliation, bringing issues to a head and resolving them. We have a very refined and sophisticated mechanism for resolution of disputes. At the risk of inflaming passions, I suggest that the IMO should enter into negotiations with the third party mediation service as its concerns would be adequately addressed there.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is an emotive issue. Long training periods, long working hours and unsatisfactory working conditions are sources of concern. There would be merit in refining the directive on working time but that would have implications for the funding of the health service. The Government has provided significant additional resources to the health service in the current year. This issue will not be resolved overnight or as a result of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A valid case could be made for the development of a career structure for non-consultant hospital doctors which would result in the establishment of a level between the non-consultant <Col N="11" /> and consultant grades. That should be seriously considered. At a time when we need to retain as many professionals as possible in the health service, we must provide incentives through improved conditions, additional remuneration etc. We have the best and brightest doctors training in Ireland and working in our health service and we must keep them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the management of the health service. There seems to be an attitude that issues will resolve themselves in due course. That is not good enough. I was quite taken aback when I discovered that some of the agreements entered into following the nurses' dispute have not been implemented in certain health board areas. That is not good and does not help in promoting good relations.</P>
    <P>We must examine this in a comprehensive way, develop a package of proposals which will satisfy health managers and doctors, examine the career structure for NCHDs and look at the Medical Manpower Forum and its deliberations. With additional resources being made available by the Government and with goodwill on all sides the dispute can be resolved to everybody's satisfaction. We must remember that patient care is also important. The welfare and career prospects of non-consultant hospital doctors is important, but so too is patient care.</P>

      <P>The best way of getting up to speed on a subject is to speak on it in the Dáil. I have great sympathy and respect for the hard work done by junior doctors. The fact that they are rostered for 65 hours and often work longer periods must be addressed. There is also a need to provide opportunities for advancement and further education which currently do not exist.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins said that up to recently doctors resulted from the caste system. If one's parents were doctors or had lots of money one could spend ten years studying medicine trying to get through the examinations. It is different nowadays as we have the best and brightest &ndash; people with between 500 and 600 points &ndash; getting first or second class honours degrees. There are very few doctors who are not of the highest intellectual calibre and the idea of the old time doctor is no more, which is a pity to some extent as I know many children of doctors who are passionate about giving medical service to patients. They know what it takes and it is unfortunate that in the current system many of these people, who would make excellent family doctors, are effectively barred from becoming doctors.</P>
      <P>Junior doctors owe something in repayment for the time, effort and money which society has invested in their education, on the basis that those doctors will achieve great wealth and riches in their more mature years, as is normally the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants to be treated by a tired, disen<Col N="12" /> chanted doctor who feels they are being abused by the system. There is an obvious need to address the untenable situation which currently applies. As has been mentioned by a number of speakers, the Department of Health and Children is already developing a number of initiatives involving NCHDs with the Health Services Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation. The first is the review of the 1997 NCHD contract. A clause in that agreement specified that the contract would be reviewed after two years. In terms of that contract it is a joke to talk about a standard working week of 39 hours given the number of hours NCHDs are expected to work, particularly in the busier teaching hospitals in the Dublin area where the intensity of activity is such that there is very little time for doctors to be on call. Rather they are asked to work not only the standard 39 hour week, but are rostered for 65 hours and in addition are under pressure from consultants to see patients, often working unrostered time which is effectively unpaid. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Over time the EU directive will reduce the number of hours which a NCHD can work, but the timescale is not acceptable to NCHDs or to the majority of the population. By 2009, when many of us will have retired, junior doctors will have to work 48 hours. By 2004 the maximum number of hours will be 58 hours, but there is no way a person working 58 hours can give the full energy and clarity of mind necessary when dealing with sick people whose lives depend on the actions of these doctors.</P>
    <P>Last month a study was initiated, which is to be completed by June 2000, in the context of preparing for implementation of the directive. It is a basis on which further negotiations can be entered into with the IMO on behalf of the NCHDs, and I hope it will be a basis for helping to reduce the number of hours to a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>The much talked about Medical Manpower Forum is hugely necessary. As vice-chairman of St. James's Hospital I am currently part of an interview panel for the appointment of a consultant in a particular speciality. The quality of the candidates for that job is phenomenal. They all have higher degrees, fellowships and fellowships in surgical specialities. It is well nigh impossible for a NCHD who is working 65 hours per week to achieve these qualifications. There must be change and an opportunity for junior doctors to attain the qualifications necessary to become a consultant.</P>
    <P>Currently one is either an indian or a chief, but there must be a continuum where qualifications of junior doctors are recognised on a step by step basis. The difference between a consultant and a hospital doctor is the difference between chalk and cheese. This must change and there should be a continuum. This will necessitate the putting in place of different grades while hospital doctors will have to be given time to further their education so they can achieve the levels of expertise <Col N="13" /> necessary so patients can be looked after with respect and dignity.</P>

      <P>Given the short time available, I wish to avert to one or two issues which encompass the entire problem we are debating. Regardless of our political persuasions Members are supportive of the non-consultant hospital doctors. We are aware of the problems in the health service which have been present for years. It is only in recent years that they have reached boiling point. We must assess why this is so. Perhaps over the years bad practice was adopted in the health services whereby, as in the case of the legal and other professions, people accepted the way things were done but when they were appointed as consultants they became intolerant of the problems faced by junior doctors even though they were acutely aware that they were still prevalent.</P>
      <P>The main issue, which is that the number of hours worked by NCHDs is unacceptable, must be addressed. An agreement was reached in 1997 whereby they were to work an average of 65 hours per week. Junior doctors and management representatives have informed me that this arrangement was arrived at between three parties, the local management, consultants and NCHDs. There was an agreement that rosters would not be changed and additional hours would not be provided unless everyone agreed to them. However, because people were busy and did not have time to get organised, arrangements were made in which the three parties were not necessarily involved. This is the crux of the issue and it must be revisited. I am pleased the Minister stated categorically that the current contracts and outstanding difficulties will be considered in the discussions with the LRC.</P>
      <P>The NCHDs have a justifiable case and the day of the Florence Nightingale syndrome is gone. People expect to be paid for their work and if they work over and above what is agreed in their contracts they expect to be remunerated. It is terrible that some doctors have had to take action for payments to be made to them. That has led to a terrible problem. The ethos of medicine has changed and there is friction between local management and doctors. I support the concerns expressed by the NCHDs and it is important in the public interest that contracts are revisited and bad practice is addressed. If people are owed money, they should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other important issues, one of which is training. In the UK training is part and parcel of a contract and is protected therein. We must examine the question of training in the context of the review of hospital practice which is under way. Training is an element of junior doctors' contracts. If they are not able to undertake the training, then there is a serious problem. Given the strain on the system doctors are often appointed to training posts and, unfortunately, they are used to fill manpower gaps. If training <Col N="14" /> can be ring fenced in contracts, many of the concerns which have been raised can be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to recruit locums and there are many reasons for their non-availability. In Letterkenny General Hospital many doctors cannot obtain locums not only because of the overall national problem whereby locums feel their conditions are poor but in peripheral areas hospitals such as that in Letterkenny find it more and more difficult not only to recruit locums but also to attract junior doctors. It is serious problem which will be exacerbated in the near future given that the Medical Council has rightly introduced new examinations and procedures for NCHDs, many of whom are non-nationals. There will be serious difficulties unless that matter is also addressed. There will also be serious manpower problems and as a consequence there will be even more stresses and strains on the system.</P>
    <P>Confidence is being eroded and that is a terrible reflection on the fabulous commitment to patient care made by these people. It is in the public interest that this dispute should be addressed as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. This debate is only the tip of the iceberg regarding many of the issues that arise on a day to day basis between local management and junior doctor about which we are not aware. I urge the IMO to enter into negotiations under the umbrella of the LRC. The Minister has made a commitment to include all issues in these negotiations. Despite the lack of confidence and bad feeling between both sides, there should be some manoeuvrability to allow the issues, with which all of us empathise, to be addressed as quickly as possible in the context of the IR mechanisms that are available. I urge the IMO to enter into constructive negotiations on behalf of the NCHDs. I agree that the issue of non-payment of unrostered overtime, in particular, must be addressed in any negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As public representatives and ordinary citizens we have a certain amount of interaction with the health service through visiting family members or friends in hospitals. All of us have witnessed the work rate of NCHDs. Few people have anything but sympathy for them. They have decide to escalate this dispute and I appeal to them to revisit their claim and make sure everything is done to ensure a strike does not go ahead next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to resolving the dispute as fairly and equitably as possible and to include all interested parties in the negotiations. Past agreements between local management and NCHDs involved a working week averaging 65 and 58 hours per week. Our health service is expanding and expectations in regard to it are huge. Minor health problems which were addressed at GP level previously are now being treated in accident and emergency wards and elsewhere which has led to the public health service being almost in a state of collapse. It is not <Col N="15" /> because of inadequate funding because since 1997 the Government has allocated large sums of money to the health service. The money is going in but we are not getting results for one reason or another. Funding is one issue, but perhaps there should be a critical analysis of management and the way money is spent.</P>
    <P>Consultants are the top professionals at work in hospitals, particularly public hospitals. These people are excellent at their jobs and whether they have arrived at the positions they occupy through privilege or on foot of their intelligence, they must be applauded for the work they do. However, non-consultant doctors are slotted into the system and given little scope to develop their own initiative. One of the reasons they are taking the route of industrial action is the lack of opportunities to advance their professional careers. People in all walks of life, particularly non-consultant hospital doctors, need to be encouraged and shown that prospects for their future careers are good.</P>
    <P>My main point is that we realise that non-consultant hospital doctors have a legitimate grievance and we know that they have been under severe pressure. However, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has asked them to bring that grievance to the Labour Relations Commission. Given the industrial relations machinery which is in place, there should be no need for a complete stand-off in this dispute. Negotiations will have to commence at some stage and the dispute will have to be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time. I support the Government's handling of the current dispute with non-consultant doctors. I urge the Irish Medical Organisation to agree to third party mediation to resolve the outstanding issues. I acknowledge the additional resources that have been made available to the health services by the Government and the Minister, in particular, and I recognise that the Government is committed to implementing structural changes in the medical workforce in hospitals.</P>
      <P>Everyone accepts that non-consultant doctors have a legitimate grievance. However, I urge them not to proceed with their industrial action on Wednesday, 17 May. I ask them to take their grievance to the Labour Relations Commission because they will be obliged to do so in order to resolve the dispute, regardless of whether they take industrial action next Wednesday or on some subsequent date. It will be better if they go before the commission sooner rather than later. There is no need for them to make the point that they possess industrial muscle because everyone accepts that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one needs to inform the Government about the important role played by health service workers. It is a fact that health services cannot be delivered without these people. We do not need them to prove their point; that point is well made. It would be a major development if we could <Col N="16" /> leapfrog the next step, namely, the proposed industrial action, and proceed to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he is prepared to consider all major issues in respect of the difficulties experienced by non-consultant hospital doctors and that is a welcome development. One issue in respect of which everyone can empathise with non-consultant doctors is the long hours they had to work in the past and will continue to work for a number of years to come. I am glad the Minister has proposed that within nine years all non-consultant doctors will only be obliged to work a 48 hour week. That development is far in the future but in the negotiations on this matter at European level other countries proposed that it should not take place for at least 13 years. The Minister has been very brave in proposing a shorter timescale, even though we know that this remains overly long. Under the circumstances, however, it is the best that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the fact that over £4 billion is being invested in the health service on an annual basis. That means that £12 million is being spent in this area per day. Since we entered Government we have invested an additional £1.5 billion per annum in the health service. I am pleased the national development plan contains capital spending of £2 billion on health. As far as I am aware, this is the first occasion on which health spending has been included in a national development plan. One result of that spending is that the hospital in Portlaoise will gain a new wing and I look forward to the Minister coming to turn the sod on that new development during the summer.</P>
    <P>Spending money on the health service is not sufficient. I do not believe we are getting value for money and, in my opinion, the resources in the health services are not being allocated properly. However, I commend the Minister for the approach he has taken in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is deplorable that the Government has failed to present reasonable proposals to resolve the dispute with non-consultant hospital doctors which will put the lives of those who are most vulnerable at risk. The number of hours these doctors work are Dickensian and are a relic of a time when workers were cruelly exploited and when children were sent into factories to work 12 hours or more per day. The Minister must accept that working two weeks in one must interfere with a doctor's ability to perform in his or her profession and inhibit his or her ability to provide proper patient care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Services Employers' Agency has failed to deal with the industrial relations problems in the health service and has been negligent or incompetent or both in its endeavours to <Col N="17" /> resolve the issues in respect of which non-consultant hospital doctors are in dispute. What other groups have been forced to take legal action to obtain the rightful overtime payments due to their members? The Minister for Health and Children must intervene immediately to ensure that this dispute does not escalate, that positions do not harden and, consequently, that the resolution of the dispute does not become more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Government should have learned from the nurses' dispute last October when it failed to enter negotiations with the nursing unions and was responsible for a bitter dispute which saw nurses marching in their thousands through the streets of Dublin. The concerns of non-consultant doctors do not merely relate to their conditions of employment; they also relate to their frustration about the service given to patients in public hospitals. They are concerned about the impact on their health of working 70, 80 or even 100 hours per week, the impairment of their ability to make clinical judgments and the fact that the stress they must endure, which is created by their conditions of employment, puts patients at risk.</P>
    <P>The pay currently received by junior doctors for work in excess of 48 hours in any week is equal to half the basic hourly rate paid to them for normal work. There is no other area of the public service which would accept half-time pay for excessive overtime.</P>
    <P>The health service in our general hospitals is under unacceptable pressure. Apart from the unacceptable, cruel and inhuman waiting lists for admittance to elective surgery, accident and emergency departments must be the most inefficient of any departments that interface with the public. If accident and emergency services were provided by private sector companies, those companies would have entered liquidation many years ago. Why must patients and their families wait for hours on end for admission to hospital? No one paying for this level of service by way of taxation should be obliged to endure such discomfort.</P>
    <P>At Limerick Regional Hospital patients are obliged to wait for hours on end, under stress and pressure, to be seen by a doctor in the accident and emergency department. On Friday, 11 December 1999, an 80 year old woman fell down the stairs in her home, was injured and, suffering severe pain, was admitted to the hospital at 1 a.m. Despite the fact that she was under severe stress, elderly and injured, she was discharged at 4 a.m. Her family informed me that on her return, she spent hours in an extreme state of stress and suffering. It is not fair to treat an elderly person in this way. I get the feeling that elderly people are almost dispensable where hospitals are concerned. The response of the Mid Western Health Board to me on that case was as follows:</P>
    <P>It is planned to develop an observation unit attached to the emergency department to allow for the accommodation of patients in a position similar to Ms X.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> This sort of treatment is not good enough. I now want to cite the case of a ten-year old boy who, in March this year, broke his arm in a sporting accident. He arrived at the accident and emergency service of the regional hospital on Monday, 20 March at 4.25 p.m., accompanied by his father. At 9.30 p.m. his father consulted the hospital staff who informed him that it would take another four hours before the child could be seen. That would have been more than nine hours after the child arrived at the hospital. As the father had to be at work at midnight, he took the child home in severe pain. The child returned with his father to the hospital the following day at 10.15 a.m. He had still not been seen at 2.30 p.m. that day. At that stage the father requested the note from the GP to the hospital and took his child to St. John's Private Hospital in Limerick. There the boy was seen and dealt with within one and a half hours. Surely, the service to the taxpayer by the health system, as demonstrated in this case, is nothing short of a disgrace and a scandal.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the discharge of suicidal patients from psychiatric treatment units. There appears to be no policy with regard to those who are in danger of committing suicide after leaving such hospitals. Research shows that the magnitude of risk of dying by suicide during the four weeks following discharge from a psychiatric hospital increases between 100 and 200 times. The risk of those who are suicidal is surely much greater than that of a normal person. I have heard from families who are frightened for the safety of a loved one who is discharged from hospital, sometimes without any consultation with the family. In several cases the families concerns have proved to be too true, and the patient has gone on to die tragically by suicide after release from hospital. There is a &ldquo;hands up&rdquo; approach by the health services whose attitude seems to be that they can do nothing if a person is determined to take his own life. This inhumane attitude is an indictment of our support system and typical of the general attitude to those who suffer from psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>In his contribution yesterday, the Minister informed the House that the Health Service Employers Agency had indicated that it is prepared to honour in full its commitment regarding the contract with non-consultant medical staff. Why has it taken the threat of industrial action for the HSEA to state that it will honour the current 1997 contract? As a result of growing unrest in 1999, at a meeting with the IMO in April and again in June last year, the HSEA was asked to issue a directive to individual hospitals urging them to honour the provisions of the 1997 contract, yet they refused to do so.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Shatter for having highlighted the serious ongoing situation regarding junior hospital doctors. There has been an alarming deterioration in our health services at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity. The hours that junior hospital doctors work not only pose a risk to doctors' health but, more seriously, they undermine their capacity to provide proper patient care. I listened with interest to Government backbenchers agreeing with what Deputy Shatter said &ndash; that the doctors have a genuine grievance about unfair treatment. I hope, perhaps in vain, that those backbenchers will act accordingly if the matter comes to a vote. Is any other group asked to work overtime for half the normal pay? Is it any wonder that 98% of non-consultant hospital doctors voted for industrial action when they have not even been paid the money they were promised? Under the law, lorry drivers are limited in the number of hours they can drive. The period during which their lorries are being loaded or unloaded is not permitted as rest time. Can young doctors be expected to work 100 hours per week and still remain fully alert for their patients?</P>
      <P>As you are fully aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there is a serious situation in Monaghan General Hospital. Three years ago, a £5-million plan was put forward by the health board, which was both necessary and essential for doctors to provide a proper service. Three years later, although many committee structures have been set up, action has not yet been taken on the matter. The Minister and others concerned in running the health service, should make sure the money is made available forthwith. If that was done, a proper level of health care could be provided at Monaghan General Hospital. There is much goodwill there but it is running out because of the serious delay in implementing the North Eastern Health Board's action plan. We can no longer take no for answer. We want the funds now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something rotten in the health service at present. There is no doubt about that. This is an example of where the economy is working but the Government is not. Things are getting worse instead of better, and waiting lists are growing. The people who are suffering are, in the main, the old and infirm. Old people in pain are lying on trolleys for hours in our hospitals with broken hips and other ailments. On top of all this, the Government and the previous Minister, presided over the first national strike by nurses in the history of the State. That is a great honour for the Government to tag on to its curriculum vitae for the next general election. It will not be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is now in danger of presiding over another strike in the health services by junior doctors. The strike is only one symptom of <Col N="20" /> the underlying malaise caused by the inaction and uncaring attitude of the Government to those who are most vulnerable and at highest risk in society &ndash; the poor. Fine Gael is calling on all sides in the dispute to get together for talks. In particular, the Minister should enter into substantial negotiations with the IMO. This dispute had to be resolved. The nurses strike was resolved eventually and this dispute will also have to be settled. Why do we have to have a strike, therefore? The Minister is at fault for not talking to those involved. The same thing happened with the nurses; the Government decided to make an example of them, but the Minister eventually had to discuss the situation. The Government will have to do it again and it should do so now. The Minister should have a realistic discussion with the doctors involved, not just a holding or bluffing measure.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be in a Celtic tiger economy yet, amazingly, older people are ringing TDs because they require medical treatment. A man rang me recently and asked what he was going to do because his hip was causing him terrible pain. What do I tell that man who is on a very long waiting list? The lists have got longer because of the Government's inaction. They were increased by the nurses' strike and the doctors' strike will have the same effect. In addition, doctors are leaving the country in droves because of better employment conditions elsewhere. The Government must also address that issue, which is as serious as the impending strike, if not more so. We will lose our best hospital doctors in the long-term. Where will we get replacements for them? The Government is storing up further trouble down the road. This is not good enough.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the very emotive issue of our health services, which are in a shambles. The Minister and the Government must take responsibility for this. The indictment of this is the waiting lists, which are a sad reflection on the previous Minister's term in office. He lost the goodwill of the people, the voluntary sector which backed up every hospital, and the dedicated nurses. I have often said in the House that a nurse is born, not made. People who are dedicated to the care of the sick were forced onto picket lines and starved off them. The Minister is now attacking the junior doctors. However, the most vulnerable people are being exploited, that is, the sick who are in hospital beds, if they are lucky enough to get one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board area, which is the most disadvantaged area in the country and has the longest waiting lists, experienced an 83% increase in waiting lists during the term of office of the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen. That does not surprise me because the health boards are not concerned about care or health. The North Eastern Health Board is concerned about circumventing the planning laws. I want the Minister, who I know is a reasonable man, to take note of the fact that the North Eastern Health <Col N="21" /> Board has spent the past 12 months trying to impose parking charges at Cavan General Hospital. That hospital was built with subscriptions from the people of Cavan and the health board was asked to administer the health care in it, of which it is making a shambles. It erected barriers 12 months ago so it could impose charges on people attending the hospital as patients or visiting family members. That was stopped when I drew attention to the illegality of the board's actions and it has spent the past 12 months with its legal advisers to see how it could circumvent the law to erect barriers and impose these charges. Last Monday, against the wishes of the people and the goodwill of the friends of Cavan General Hospital, the executive of the North Eastern Health Board erected its barriers. Now one has to pay to attend Cavan General Hospital as either a patient or a visitor. That is all the board is concerned about. An old lady told me that when she went to the hospital to have her hand attended to there were 12 people to take her name and address but there was no one to put a bandage on her hand. That says it all and this is happening nationwide.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on giving us the opportunity to examine this terrible mess. We cannot administer a decent health service for a population of 3.5 million people. There is nothing but complaint after complaint. We have the finest equipment, doctors and surgeons but it is impossible to see them. I do not blame those people who work long hours. However, the administration of health services in this country is in a shambles. The Minister is in charge and must take responsibility. If the health boards are not doing their duty and are top heavy with administrative staff without enough staff to administer health care, it is time to re-examine that. There are far too many people with good jobs who have no idea how to treat patients. They sit in offices and dole out reams of paper about costs, charges and so on. However, as the poor old lady said, there is no one to bandage a finger. It is time that stopped.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister left an unholy mess behind him. It is time we took a serious look at this and gave our people the care they deserve. I thank Deputy Shatter for the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Shatter and thank him for giving us the opportunity to air our views on this issue. I feel very strongly about the condition of our health services. While the nurses' strike ended before Christmas, there is still unrest among nurses who are unhappy with the situation, many of whom are voting with their feet. The same is true of non-consultant junior hospital doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been aware for a long time that junior doctors work long hours, which are unfair and unnatural. While this could be seen as exploitation, it was always passed off by saying it was part of their training and that they would forget about it when they were consultants. However, <Col N="22" /> they have the support of the senior consultants in this action.</P>
    <P>This situation is not good enough, particularly in regard to patient care. Many issues have been highlighted in the House today and last night and in the media in regard to the horrendous hours junior doctors must work. Nobody can function under those conditions and it is putting patient care at risk.</P>
    <P>Junior doctors have already spent a long time, six or seven years, in college. They are in a very difficult position. Many of their peers in other professions and jobs are able to buy houses and cars and take holidays. Junior doctors cannot afford to do that or to start families in their twenties, as many of them would like to, which is an unnatural situation and probably one of the reasons so few women make it to consultant level in hospitals. I have no doubt that women find those hours unbearable, particularly if they marry or want to have children in those years. The horrendously long hours contribute to the fact that there are so few women at consultant level.</P>
    <P>There is very low morale in our health services. Waiting lists have increased continuously since the Government took office. A strike by non-consultant hospital doctors would further increase those waiting lists. It is the doctors and nurses dealing with patients who must explain to them that there are no beds and that they must spend nights on trolleys. We all hear stories daily which make us very uncomfortable. It is very difficult to give answers to people in that situation and their families.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot solve the problem in our health services without the support of the junior hospital doctors. I call on him to speak with the IMO in an effort to resolve the situation rather than letting a strike take place. We have a week in which I hope the situation can be resolved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am delighted to support the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Shatter, for two reasons. The first is that it is a very serious motion and the second is that I am delighted I survived a visit to a hospital. I want to thank you publicly, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for talking me into having some common sense and going for a check-up. But for you, I might not be contributing to this debate. This is my first contribution since the last century and I am delighted to be back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is extremely important. I feel very sorry for junior doctors. I understand their situation because of my recent hospital visit. When I was there, the lady doctor on duty I met at 11 a.m. had been there since 7 p.m. the previous night and was going to be on duty for the rest of the day. It is grossly unfair to expect anyone to go on regardless. Someone made the excuse that they can have a snooze &ndash; I am sure they do not get a satisfactory sleep if they are woken up after a quarter of an hour and have to go back to work. It is unbelievable in this new millennium that <Col N="23" /> doctors are treated in this way. It seems to have been taken for granted that they should do this.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to them and to the patients after whom they look. Who needs to be more alert than a doctor who administers medicine and so on? If they are suffering from fatigue, the patients are at risk. It also means they are not in good humour as they should be. People who are sick need people to be pleasant to them. It is hard to blame somebody who is exhausted if they are not in as good a humour as they should be.</P>
    <P>Someone said they are only starting off in their careers and that they will finish up as consultants. Maybe they will, but one has to live long enough to be a consultant. If one is dead before one reaches that stage, one is no use to anyone, including oneself. Consultants are important and I praise them for their wonderful skills. We appreciate all they do.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a general comment on the health services without repeating much of what has been said about waiting lists and so on. As we all know, there is a long queue for operations. A family member of a person on a medical card decided to pay for that person's hip operation. That person decided to get an X-ray and mentioned they were going privately as they were fed up waiting and straightaway they were charged for that X-ray. If people with medical cards are prepared to go privately and to pay for operations, it would be a good investment on the part of the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or any other Department to at least provide some facilities rather than say that because they are going privately, they will be cut off. It is a short sighted policy and it should be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The junior doctors' strike is the tip of the iceberg of the problems in our health services. We will see those health services dissolve into chaos if urgent action is not taken by the Minister. If the current issues are not resolved quickly, hospitals will not only be left without junior doctors for a few hours, days or weeks, but indefinitely. I spoke to a number junior doctors in recent days and they told me they can see a mass resignation of junior doctors and that within one month or two anything between 80% or 90% of junior doctors could have handed in their notice. As Members will know, this happened in other countries and forced major reform of the system. I sincerely hope the Minister will not wait for this Doomsday situation to arrive before he tackles the long festering problems affecting junior doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mass resignation could serve as a more attractive option for many disillusioned NCHDs because it would eliminate for them the dilemma of strike action which many of them see as a major problem in their role as concerned and caring people. There will be a haemorrhage of junior doctors from Ireland to countries like our nearest neighbour, the UK, because the UK is putting in <Col N="24" /> place a better training system. Over there, junior doctors make much better progress at a quicker rate within the system. Junior doctors realise that and are setting their sights on getting out of the system which has exploited them for so long.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom is currently trying to recruit an additional 7,000 doctors in order to bring the working hours for junior doctors in line with the European Union regulations. This, in itself, with pose an even greater threat to the Irish health services because junior doctors know that if they leave here to go to the UK, they are guaranteed better working hours, training, pay and prospects. The challenge for the Government is to develop a system which not only keeps the doctors we have here, but also attracts people back to this country. That is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I received some shocking statistics in recent days from the Southern Health Board area showing the length of time people must wait for in-patient admissions. At Cork University Hospital, the figures are unbelievable and frightening. People wait an average of 85 months for urology, 75 months for plastic surgery, 61 months for ophthalmology, 25 months for cardiac surgery, 17 months for cardiology, 43 months for gynaecology and 38 months for neurosurgery.</P>
    <P>At Tralee General Hospital, there is a 32 month waiting period for gynaecology, 32 months for surgery, 24 months for orthopaedic surgery and 40 months for ENT procedures which are essential for young people at an early age to enable them develop before they go to school. In Cork, St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital has a waiting list of 48 weeks for orthopaedic surgery.</P>
    <P>The industrial action, if it proceeds, will be a disaster for thousands of sick people who are expecting treatment for their illnesses and diseases. I ask the Minister to get into realistic negotiations with the IMO and to put forward proposals which will convince junior doctors that he is genuine and serious about resolving the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, on his handling of this issue and also endorse the Government's handling of this dispute. I appeal to the Irish Medical Organisation to enter into the mediation process because for its part, the Health Service Employers Agency, has always accepted invitations from the Labour Relations Commission and/or the Labour Court. It has always accepted the findings of those bodies and, indeed, it has adhered scrupulously to whatever those findings or recommendations were.</P>
      <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn claimed the Government has not valued nursing and spoke of the reluctance of people to apply for nursing posts. I would like to inform the House that the number of applications for student nursing posts is double the number of available places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to junior doctors, the Government fully accepts that some NCHDs working hours <Col N="25" /> are too long and need to be reduced. It also accepts that an enhanced training arrangement is required to keep young doctors at home. Furthermore, the Government accepts that difficulties can arise when NCHDs move house during their career. The Government also accepts that a new arrangement for overtime needs to be put in place.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations machinery of the State has been in place to resolve this type of conflict between junior doctors and health service employers and I urge the Irish Medical Organisation to avail of this machinery. Deputy McManus misinterpreted what Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said last night. Deputy O'Keeffe was not blaming patients for our difficulties but was indicating the challenges facing the health services at present, which we all recognise. This Government has put huge resources into the health services since 1997, namely, £1,500 million. This significant additional funding of £1,500 million is very substantial when compared to the previous Government's investment of just under £400 million.</P>
    <P>I accept the difficulties with junior doctors' working hours have been with us for 20 to 30 years. Problems which have existed for so long cannot be solved with the stroke of a pen. It takes seven years to train a doctor and another year is spent as an intern which means that from today, it would take over eight years to produce a large number of additional NCHDs from our universities. The nine year period for implementation of the 48 hour week is not used to long finger the proposal but to allow time for its implementation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the best course of action to deal with the complexities of this case &ndash; and it is extremely complex &ndash; is independent third party negotiation. The Labour Relations Commission has agreed to examine the issues affecting non-consultant hospital doctors. The Health Service Employers Agency, on behalf of health service employers, has agreed to participate in this process. Again, I ask the Irish Medical Organisation to agree to mediation so that the difficulties can be resolved, both for the benefit of patients in our hospitals and the well-being of junior doctors.</P>
    <P>The proposed industrial action on 17 May will not, of itself, resolve this dispute. It will have to be resolved through the efforts of all the parties. The Irish Medical Organisation should, therefore, enter into discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies McCormack and Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-consultant hospital doctors have a vital and pivotal role in the provision of health services. Without the services of junior doctors our health services would grind to a halt overnight. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are probably one of the most exploited groups within the health care sector. What other group is expected to work between 80 and 100 hours per <Col N="26" /> week and can at times be on continuous duty for up to 36 hours? Everyone agrees that alertness and concentration are crucial when ministering to the sick. Can we reasonably expect such levels of concentration and alertness from people who may be suffering fatigue and weariness after 36 hours of continuous duty? These Victorian work practices lend themselves to an unacceptable level of alertness and concentration which are such essential elements in providing care for hospital patients. One can justifiably say that such work practices are not alone unacceptable from the point of view of providing health care, but hazardous to the health of the junior doctors. That 98% of non-consultant hospital doctors voted for industrial action in support of shorter working hours, higher overtime rates and better staffing ratios speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>If this strike is allowed to take place it will lead to longer waiting lists. Last October we had the first nurses' strike in the history of the State. This strike was brought about because the Government and the Minister refused to enter meaningful negotiations with the nurses' unions. While the work stoppages contributed to an increase in the hospital waiting lists, the Government was eventually forced to initiate talks and to address the long-term grievances of the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any other sector where class division is more apparent than in the provision of medical services and hospital care. We have a two-tier health system with private and public sectors. If one is fortunate enough to be able to afford private medical care there are no waiting lists or delays. Beds are readily available within hours and the necessary procedures are carried out almost immediately. These people are not worried about waiting lists or delays. It is a super-efficient, cash on delivery service. However, the situation is completely different for those dependent on the public health system. They are subjected to long delays in seeing a consultant before even graduating to the waiting list. This has been described by Deputy Shatter as the waiting list to get onto the waiting list. These waiting lists are getting longer at both national and regional level. During the lifetime of this Government, hospital waiting lists have increased by 30%, despite unprecedented economic prosperity. According to the latest available figures, there are now almost 37,000 patients waiting for hospital care, probably the highest number on record.</P>
    <P>In the North Western Health Board area matters have deteriorated to critical levels. Between March 1997 and December 1999, the waiting lists of the two major hospitals, Letterkenny and Sligo, increased by 26%, from 1,707 to 2,146. In Letterkenny the list increased by 21% during that time, from 583 to 704. In Sligo the position is even more critical and the increase was 28%. These figures, of course, do not include people from Donegal and the north west who may have been referred to hospitals outside the area, those who may need cardiac or oncology procedures in Dub<Col N="27" /> lin or elsewhere. Seriously ill people are forced to spend their life savings to obtain urgent and essential medical services in the private sector. Depending on their public health service means continued suffering over prolonged periods. The necessary resources must be provided to the health services so that this national scandal can be addressed in a serious and meaningful way. If the junior doctors' strike is allowed to take place, and perhaps escalate, it will lead to longer waiting lists and extra suffering for those dependent on the public health sector.</P>
    <P>The health services are disintegrating. Nurses had to strike last October. Next week it will be the turn of the junior doctors and we learned this morning that next month it will probably be the turn of the psychiatric nurses. The system is falling apart and the Minister and the Government seem to be paralysed. Unless we address the genuine grievances of our health workers we are heading for a crisis of our own making.</P>
    <P>The quality of the health service available to the people is an indication of the level of justice in our society but we seem to be very far down on that scale. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to defuse this serious situation before it becomes worse and subjects our people to further hardships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who have contributed to this very important debate on another of the issues relevant to our health service which arise due to the total incompetence of the Government. I thank those who spoke on this side of the House, including Deputy McManus and her Labour Party colleagues. It was clear from some of the contributions from the Government side that some Government backbenchers are not resting too easy with the Government's approach to health issues, particularly with the manner in which junior hospital doctors are being treated. Having gone through the time honoured genuflection in the direction of the Minister for political reasons, some of his colleagues set out quite clearly their very real concerns.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech last night. I was hopeful that he would have something to say that would point us in the direction of a solution to the crisis with which we are confronted. The Minister's speech was more remarkable for what he omitted than for what he included, much of which was a litany of background information with which we are all familiar and of which the IMO and the junior doctors have heard for many months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had nothing to say about a number of very important issues. I raised the fact that there are junior doctors who have worked overtime and who find that the only way to get paid by hospitals for overtime worked is by threatening legal action or going to the Labour Relations Commission. I asked the Minister that all overtime due to junior doctors for work properly undertaken by them be discharged and that he <Col N="28" /> direct health boards and hospitals to treat their employees properly. The Minister was silent on the issue of arrears of overtime. I drew to the Minister's attention the fact that under the partnership agreement, junior doctors should have received their 1% increase in salary, which began at the beginning of April, in their salary cheques at the beginning of May but that they have not yet received their 1% increase. I asked the Minister to ensure this was paid. This is an issue which should not have given rise to any difficulty, yet the Minister had nothing to say about it.</P>
    <P>In the context of pretending that something of note was happening, the Minister referred to the fact that the Health Service Employers Agency has indicated that it is prepared to honour in full its commitments regarding the 1997 contract and wishes to ensure that commitments are complied with. Why has it taken the threat of industrial action for the HSEA to say it will honour the current 1997 contract? This should have been honoured from day one. Why has the Minister or his predecessor not ensured that it was honoured? Why has the Minister or his predecessor not ensured that faith was kept with junior doctors so that they knew, when agreements were entered into with the HSEA, that they would be honoured and complied with by the State bodies and hospitals whose funding is provided by the State? This should not be an issue. This is part of the problem with the functioning of the health service whose administration is incapable of maintaining a modern system in operation, which is slowly disintegrating and treats with contempt not only patients waiting up to three years on in-patient hospital waiting lists but the service providers &ndash; nurses and doctors &ndash; who are given no respect for what they do.</P>
    <P>Some of the language used in the speech delivered by the Minister last night is indicative of the psyche of the Government and the thinking in the Department of Health and Children. The Minister said, &ldquo;Young doctors tend to leave at the point where they have just acquired the skills and expertise and are ready to make a real contribution to Irish hospitals.&rdquo;  Is he saying, on behalf of the Government, that newly qualified doctors, on whose backs rested the great weight of maintaining a functioning public hospital system, made no contribution of value in their first year or first two or three years working in our hospitals? Is that the psyche? Junior doctors are of the view, as nurses were, that no real value is attached to the work they do not only by some of the health boards and hospitals for which they work but also by the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>Their view that they are treated in an unacceptable manner derives not merely from the fact that the Minister and the Department have no interest in the reality that they are not properly paid but also from the fact that, although the maximum number of working hours per week is supposed to be 65, they are working up to 100 hours per week. That amount of work in any one week in any profession is not sustainable. In the <Col N="29" /> context of a profession in which one develops skills which enables one to diagnose whether patients are suffering from life threatening illnesses, this is something which the people and members of all parties in the House should not tolerate in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>In his self-serving amendment to the motion, traditionally tabled by Governments on Private Members' time, the Minister asks Dáil Éireann to endorse the Government's handling of the current dispute. For six months discussions took place with the HSEA. Yet, no substantive proposals were made. The IMO is not entering into discussions with the Labour Relations Commission because there is nothing of substance on the table that the parties can discuss and conciliate and on which they can negotiate. The Government has sat back and watched yet another health crisis develop. There is to be a one day strike next week and a two day strike the following week with the possibility of an all out strike by the end of this month. This would have a detrimental impact on patient care and a dramatic impact on hospital waiting lists which at the end of December stood at 37,000. Judging from the leak from the Department following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, which was no doubt designed to soften up the media so that when the actual figures are released it will not regard them as news, no real dent has been made in the figures in the first three months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government has proved itself to be completely incapable of properly managing and running the health service. It does not deserve to win <Col N="30" /> the vote in the House this morning. The Minister has a clear duty. His duty is to intervene now to ensure substantive real proposals are placed on the table which can lead to discussion, negotiation, conciliation and resolution of the dispute in a manner which is satisfactory to junior doctors and which protects patients and avoids a strike next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>In the context of the formal votes which take place in the House on Private Members' time, we know the numbers add up on the Government side and that some of the so-called Independent Deputies, such as Deputy Healy-Rae, who are really Independent Fianna Fáil automatically vote with the Government. Deputy Healy-Rae who is very vocal on all sorts of issues has not bothered to come into the House for any portion of the debate on this important health issue or attempted to contribute to it. In case he is watching on the monitor, I remind him that his nephew who worked until last summer as a junior doctor in Cork University Hospital decided that he would be better off playing the bodhrán in Thailand than working in our health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Its purpose is to enable the Government to make a payment of £20 million as a Twelfth Replenishment of the International Development Association, known as IDA12. The Bill amends the International Development Association Acts, 1960 to 1997, to allow the above payment to be made to the association.</P>
      <P>Ireland joined the association on its foundation in 1960 and made its first contribution in 1962. The Bill is a technical measure and many people will be interested to know what the International Development Association is. The International Development Association, or IDA, is the World Bank's group concessionary lending window. It provides long-term loans at zero interest rates to the poorest developing countries. The mission of IDA is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in its poorest member countries. IDA helps build the human capital policies, institutions and physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. Its goals are to reduce the disparities across and within countries, to bring more people into the mainstream and to promote equitable access to the benefits of development.</P>
      <P>IDA lends only to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income in 1998 of less than $895 per annum and which lack the financial ability to borrow from other World Bank institutions. At present, 78 countries are eligible to borrow from the IDA. Together these countries are home to 2.3 billion people, a substantial proportion of the total population of the earth. In fact, it is 53% of the world's population. Today, 1.5 billion of these people survive on incomes of less than $2 per day. When discussing our own circumstances we should bear these countries and their serious levels of poverty in mind.</P>

    <P>IDA lending has a maturity of 35 to 40 years, with a ten year grace period on repayment of principal. When a country receives a loan through the IDA it is not obliged to make repayments on the capital for the first ten years. There is no interest charged but credits do carry a small service charge which is currently three-quarters of <Col N="33" /> 1% on undistributed balances. This percentage effectively covers the administration costs involved in managing overall IDA activities.</P>
    <P>Since 1960, IDA has lent almost $115 billion to over 100 countries. It spends, on average, $5 billion to $6 billion per annum for different development projects, especially those that address basic needs such as primary education, basic health services, clean water and sanitation. It also funds projects that protect the environment, improve conditions for private businesses, build necessary infrastructure and support reforms aimed at liberalising countries' economies. These projects pave the way towards economic growth, job creation, higher income levels and a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently a member of the World Bank and its four affiliates, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Ireland joined the World Bank in 1957 and the IDA in 1960. Our total capital subscription to the bank to date amounts to approximately $636 million or 0.35% of total subscriptions. About 6% or $37 million of the subscription has been paid and is usable by the World Bank for lending. The remaining 94% of the subscription is non-paid in or callable capital which constitutes a general guarantee on the bank's obligation. Ireland's subscriptions and contributions to the International Development Association since 1960 have amounted to $114 million or £70 million.</P>
    <P>How does the IDA allocate its funds to the various countries? The reason this organisation is part of the World Bank is that it operates like a bank. There is a commercial discipline attached to its lending even though it is interest free and subject only to the small administration fee of three-quarters of 1%. Rather than give non-repayable grants, it imposes a discipline on the receiving countries to use the funds wisely because the money will have to be repaid 30 to 40 years hence. The benefit of this policy is that many countries which received funds 20 or 30 years ago are repaying them now and the moneys are coming back into the IDA. It means there is effectively a revolving fund. From that point of view, it is better than grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The moneys we advanced to the IDA in the 1960s and 1970s and which was loaned to various countries is now coming back into the system and is being loaned again to other countries which need it at present. In due course those funds will return to be loaned to further countries in need in the next generation. There is a banking approach but it is a lenient approach given that the funds are effectively interest free.</P>
    <P>The IDA uses certain criteria to determine which countries are eligible to borrow IDA resources. The first is relative poverty which is defined as GNP <i>per capita</i> below an established threshold. The current threshold is $895 per annum. The next is lack of credit worthiness to borrow on market terms and, therefore, a need <Col N="34" /> for concessional resources to finance the country's development programme. Many countries would not meet commercial World Bank criteria for advancing loans and the IDA is the lender of last resort to those countries. They cannot get funding from other sources. It is also important that the recipient countries have good policy performance, defined as the implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction. Each year the World Bank and IDA carry out performance ratings of the various countries because it is important they do not give money out willy-nilly. There must be certain criteria.</P>
    <P>They look at a variety of areas, including the economic management of those countries, their structural policies, policies for social inclusion and equity and public sector management and institutions. It is important the funds are given to countries where they will be of real benefit and where the countries meet certain criteria.</P>
    <P>These are all the macro-economic issues about which we, in the western world, might be concerned, but we must ask ourselves what is done by the International Development Association. The IDA addresses poverty through a broad range of projects, including projects targeted at human resource development such as education, health, safety nets, water supply and sanitation, the provision of infrastructure, and agriculture and rural development. The IDA also contributes to poverty reduction by advising governments on the best policies for attaining broad-based economic growth and reducing the vulnerability of the poor to economic shocks.</P>
    <P>The IDA is now the single largest donor of funds for basic social services in the poorest countries. Children, 1 billion of whom live in IDA recipient countries, are the main beneficiaries of the resulting investment in basic health, primary literacy education and clear water. To put it simply, thanks to the IDA, some 45,000 primary school classrooms have been constructed or rehabilitated in African countries which enabled 1.8 million children to benefit from access to primary education; in Asia, more than 6,700 health care facilities were constructed or upgraded and then equipped and staffed to provide basic health care for a rural population; the social investment fund in Latin America reached some 9.5 million beneficiaries and activities supported by these projects generated almost 1 million person months of employment; in Africa, some 5 million textbooks, mostly produced and developed locally in Africa, were supplied to the primary schools; and in India, the national AIDS control project supported training of 52,500 physicians and has 60% of the nursing staff in the HIV/AIDS management topics. When one looks at the result of the donations from the western countries, one sees the real impact of the delivery of funds on ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Many of these situations are addressed by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the first international response to provide compre<Col N="35" /> hensive debt relief to the Third World's most heavily indebted poor countries. This initiative was launched by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996. It is a matter which we discussed here at length over the past year in the context of the legislation relating to the Bretton Woods Agreement and as part of Ireland's contribution to the poorer nations. The HIPC initiative broke new ground by removing the debt overhang for countries which pursue economic and social reform targeted at measurable poverty reduction and reducing multilateral debt, and it also helps countries exit from endless debt restructuring into lasting debt relief. In summary, the World Bank has worked pro-actively towards rapid implementation of the HIPC initiative. Some 14 countries have qualified at least partially for debt relief packages amounting to some $23 billion. Some nine countries have formally qualified for more than $14 billion in debt relief and five have qualified preliminarily for an additional $9 billion. The HIPC initiative is well under way and it is having a real and practical impact in these heavily indebted countries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the general support which the Bill has received from the Opposition parties during the debate to date. It is a sign that Ireland is a mature nation which has come a long way in 70 years. Having been the recipient of funds after the Second World War, Ireland is proud to be in a position to contribute to such funds.</P>
    <P>Ireland contributed £13 million to the last tranche under the legislation and the Bill makes provision for a contribution of £20 million to be paid over a six year period. It is not that Ireland will pay just approximately £3 million per annum because the last tranche is still ongoing and within the next few years the thirteenth round will be up and running. Therefore, Ireland will be contributing to perhaps three different tranches of this fund in any one year. Since 1960, Ireland has contributed £70 million to the fund and this year we will contribute £7 million. I look forward to the legislation to enable Ireland to provide funds in due course for the next round, which will deal with the thirteenth replenishment of the IDA's funds, which is due to commence next month.</P>
    <P>An important part of this initiative is that this will be the first time the International Development Association will contribute to the HIPC initiative, to which I referred already. To date, most of that was done specifically through the World Bank, but now the IDA will make direct contributions towards alleviating the debt in these Third World countries. That brings me to the question of debt cancellation and what is called breaking the chain of debt. Many Deputies, and especially members of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, would have received many representations on this topic since we discussed the Bretton Woods Agreement legislation some time ago. We must join the people who are involved in the campaign of the Jubilee 2000 committee and support them in their <Col N="36" /> work, and also recognise the outstanding world leadership on debt cancellation provided by the Pope, President Clinton and Bono and various other high profile media stars which has been a tremendous help.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to look at European level at an initiative which is known as the Clarke proposal, which is named after the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, whenever it is appropriate. Mr. Clarke mentioned the possibility of putting a levy on all foreign exchange transactions to provide an international fund to relieve debt in Third World countries. Many institutions and banks in the western world are making substantial profits purely on foreign exchange transactions and a small levy could alleviate the substantial debt in some of those countries. One must bear in mind that most of these poor countries have weak currencies and suffer as a result of these foreign exchange transactions. Normally these currencies are most disadvantaged by devaluations and they need help in this regard. I recognise that there are practical difficulties in implementing such a levy. It would need to be done almost on a world-wide basis because if a country or a particular exchange was not involved in implementing this levy, a great deal of business would be attracted to that country to avoid paying it. However, the principle is correct. The mechanics of it will be difficult to arrange, but it is something we should look at to provide a fund which could be used to cancel the debt of the poorest countries in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about how much Ireland is contributing to overseas development aid. I want to highlight that in 1992, Ireland contributed £40 million to ODA and in 1999, we contributed £178 million. That is a four-fold increase during the course of the 1990s. Ireland's GNP in 1992 was £25 billion and now it is £56 billion, which is a two-fold increase. Therefore, Ireland's contribution to ODA has increased four-fold during a period when the GNP increased two-fold. Ireland has effectively doubled the contribution to ODA as a proportion of GNP from a figure of 0.16% in 1992 to a figure of 0.31% this year. We all realise that 0.31% is not sufficient, but we must recognise that we have made a considerable improvement from the position in the early 1990s. The Government, as part of its review of its programme for Government, is looking at the total contribution to ODA to see the measures it can implement to increase it even further. While I must acknowledge that significant progress has been made, I recognise that more progress can be made in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland's track record of contributions to development in Third World countries is good when we take account of the voluntary sector, whether it is through organisations like Concern, GOAL or other non-governmental agencies. In general, the NGOs will be happy with the Bill in that Ireland is making a direct contribution to a fund which does not charge any interest to the receiving countries. In contrast to the legislation <Col N="37" /> on the Bretton Woods Agreement, on which we were contacted by a large number of people in the constituencies who were concerned about Ireland's contribution to the fund under that legislation, I received no representations on the Bill. People must be satisfied that we are making a contribution to this fund. If that was not so, we would have heard about it outside this House before now.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a keen interest in contributing to ODA. Some 150 years ago Ireland experienced famine, which was immortalised in song ever since. At that time Ireland was exporting corn and other edible products while people were dying of starvation. In years to come the poorer countries will feel they were ravaged in the same way, considering people are dying of starvation in their countries and vast amounts of their resources are going towards paying interest and contributing to the profit of western banks. I believe this is the modern day version of what happened during the Irish Famine 150 years ago when products rather than financial resources were leaving the country. However, it amounts to the same thing at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>We must consider the basic human rights of people in these heavily indebted poorer countries. We must recognise that we in the west are the haves whereas people in the poorer countries are the have nots. Our duty is to improve the living standards of everyone, not just in the western world but on the planet. We all live in a global village and this Bill is a positive step towards improving the living standards of people in poorer countries. I support fully the proposals in the Bill and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Twelfth Replenishment of the International Development Association is timely and Ireland's contribution of £20 million, which the Bill will enable the Government to make, is an appropriate contribution. The overall contribution from donor countries will be approximately £10 billion, therefore, this is not a huge amount of money in proportion to the total replenishment. This is Ireland fulfilling its international obligations and the £20 million will be reckonable when calculating what percentage of GNP we donate to overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>The money being allocated to the IDA is being used for the poorest of the poor countries. It is being used for the 80 poorest countries in the world. I note from the explanatory memorandum that it is being used for countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of less than £720 per annum and that more than 90% of the IDA lending goes to countries with <i>per capita</i> income below £507 per annum, or the enormous sum of £1.76p per day. This is targeted at the poorest people on the planet and the lending is undertaken in 80 of the poorest countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with the stated objectives of IDA lending. They correspond to the objective of Ireland's overseas development programme, <Col N="38" /> which is welcome. This is an investment in people, in primary education, clean water and sanitation to ensure there is at least a basic universal health service available in these countries. It is also designed to promote broad based growth, an approach which should be adopted universally. It is designed to support good governance because there is not much point in overseas development aid either by way of direct grant or lending if those countries are governed by corrupt regimes which hoover up the bulk of the money being made available from abroad. Hand in hand with the proper investment in poorer countries, there must be increasing and sustainable democracy. The combination of aid and democracy are the two streams which will develop human rights in these poor countries. Many of these countries and their citizens are not just the victims of poverty but of human rights transgressions also.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael generally welcomes the Bill. We are of the view that we lag far behind in our obligations in terms of overseas development aid and that, on an all-party basis, we should make a commitment to increase in a very short time our overseas development aid under all headings up to our international obligation of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    <P>The world is a much changed place from the world that existed even when many of us entered this Parliament. Since the Berlin Wall came down, people's way of looking at the world has changed because the world has changed. There was a theory at the time that this was the end of history. An American academic of Japanese origin, Fukiama, promulgated the view that it was the end of history, that the western democracies, the free market and liberal democracy was the way forward, that this model would be adopted worldwide and that as a consequence there would be no further conflict between peoples. He said that while there might be outbreaks of nationalism in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world, the big battles were over and we were going to proceed through the nineties and into the next millennium with that new model. It would not be a Cold War model any more where the east was pitted against the west, where forms of Marxism or socialism were pitted against capitalism but the end of history where liberal democracy reigns supreme. Of course, this has not happened. The conflicts which are now developing are between the great world civilisations. Western Christianity is ignored on the one hand. There is the Islamic world, orthodox Christianity, the Hindu civilisations, the Chinese civilisation and Japanese civilisation. One will find that every world conflict is now in the fault line between civilisations, whether that is the conflict in Chechnya between Russian Orthodoxy and Slavic civilisation and that of Islam or the conflicts nearer to home in the Balkans.</P>
    <P>These are conflicts between the civilisations and they are at the meeting points of the great civilisations. That is the model and the best way of seeing the world order at present. It is the best <Col N="39" /> paradigm to understand what is happening in the world. Frequently the fault lines between the civilisations are also the fault lines between the rich and poor. It is an uncontradictable fact of history that where poor countries adjoin rich countries, the people from the poor countries will attempt to move to the rich countries. That has always happened. There has never been a rich civilisation yet which did not act as a magnet to attract people from the surrounding poorer lands. However, the pace of the migration has changed dramatically. It probably took over a millennium for the Celtic people to move from the Caucuses until they arrived in Ireland. Now this is just a four hour plane journey and one can obtain the information on the Internet to make sure one knows how to proceed when one arrives.</P>
    <P>The pace of change is colossal and when we reflect on our overseas development aid, we should not just see it in terms of our social objectives, our commitment to social progress based on our common humanity with the poor people of the world, but as the other side of the coin of the domestic problems in Ireland in terms of migration to Ireland and Europe. We should see it also in terms of the conflicts in the world at present. We are looking at a very small part of a jigsaw which could provide a new world order, not just on the grounds of our shared common humanity but on selfish grounds, so that we can develop countries to encourage people towards self-fulfilment and self-development in their own lands. We should also be looking at these issues.</P>
    <P>Migration is an issue which will be of increasing importance in Europe and Ireland and could dominate politics over the next 25 to 30 years. Millions of people would love to come to countries like Ireland and they will take all sorts of steps to arrive there. If anyone on the Government benches is thinking that we have a small refugee problem and if we could get the process correct it will all end in a year or 18 months, that will not happen. We are looking at the commencement of one of the major issues of the next generation and we have manifestations of it already. The principal reason people migrate is that they want a better lifestyle. As night follows day, people will migrate from poor disadvantaged areas to prosperous areas. We are now one of the most prosperous parts of the world and as night follows day, people will want to live here. Many will come from Islamic countries but a significant proportion will come from the 80 countries mentioned. We have a vested interest in developing the poorest countries of the world to ensure they can provide their citizens with a satisfactory lifestyle. There will always be an elite in these countries who will seek to migrate but if the majority of people were free from hunger and disease and had adequate shelter, universal primary education and universal health services, particularly for children, it would be a huge leap forward and would provide them with a satisfactory lifestyle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Unless we take more seriously the issue of overseas development aid and move away from symbols and tokenism and a slow bicycle race to ensure we do not do any more than our partners in Europe or the US and Canada, we will be on a loser. As a small European country, we have a huge vested interest in ensuring the poor countries of the world are developed to a sufficient standard. Not only should we argue the case on the basis of what a decent country should do for the poor, we should also argue it on the basis of Europe's vested interest in ensuring a better world order can emerge.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to world peace. Most future conflicts will arise between people who see themselves as disadvantaged in contrast to what they regard as advantaged people, usually of another civilisation. That is the wellspring of violence and war. All the current and recent conflicts or wars contain these elements. We must address the crucial issue of how countries can be developed to sustain their current populations and how they can become prosperous. Let us consider, for example, the less poor Islamic nations of North Africa. The number of under-25 year olds without work in Algeria is colossal. There is no way the energetic, healthy and educated people in the Islamic countries of North Africa will remain idle in economies which are not working when they look across the Mediterranean and witness the wonders and prosperity of Europe.</P>
    <P>The issues of migration and peace are now closely linked with the issue of overseas development aid and we should place overseas development aid in that wider context. I urge Ministers who attend European conferences in which this issue arises to place the matter in this broader context as the rich industrial countries would then be more willing to put their shoulders to the wheel in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>A number of issues is linked in our new world order. There is the issue of aid to poor countries and the writing off of debt and the issue of how much rich industrial countries, of which Ireland is one, are prepared to pay to change the situation, not only on humanitarian grounds but also for other reasons. One of the negative issues which arises is the unprecedented level of migration which has occurred in a short period of time. Nothing like this happened previously in peace time in such a short period. Millions of people are on the move, many waving the flag of political asylum. However, persecution in the countries of origin is not people's prime motivation; most of them are economic migrants who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families in the same way as the Irish did when they travelled to the US, Australia and the UK in the past.</P>
    <P>The migration issue is closely associated with other issues of conflict between countries and if these issues are not addressed, we will witness increasing levels of international terrorism and increasing proliferation of nuclear weapons. If poor countries believe they are being exploited by rich or strong countries, there are traditionally <Col N="41" /> only two ways in which they can balance the scales. They can move from conventional warfare to terrorism or they can obtain or produce nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The move towards nuclear weaponry on a worldwide basis is frightening and it is frightening to note the countries which have the capacity for nuclear weapons. However, if one analyses the situation, one will find that the countries which have nuclear weapons are, in conventional terms, weaker than their opponents. That is what the west did following World War II when it decided that the conventional armies of Russia and the Eastern Bloc were far stronger than those in Europe and the United States. The equation was balanced by going down the nuclear route and that move was re-balanced in the arms race by other countries which sought to have nuclear weaponry on an equal basis. Pakistan went nuclear because, conventionally, India was too strong. Israel went nuclear because it was surrounded by Arab countries and, conventionally, could not win without western aid and sometimes could not win even with such aid. Iran also has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons and Iraq probably has the capacity to do so.</P>
    <P>While we are strictly speaking about the replenishment of the IDA in the context of overseas development aid, the issue of overseas development aid should be debated in a far wider context than that of our humanitarian obligations to citizens of poorer countries. There is a much wider agenda here which encompasses the migration issue, the issue of world peace, international terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If one were to look for something tangible to produce a solution to the evils I have outlined, it could best be achieved through the provision of increased levels of aid and assistance to people of goodwill who are involved in the democratisation of poorer countries. If we pitch the agenda in that direction in the fulfilment of our international obligations, we will achieve a better result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents an important arm of the Government's policy towards the assistance of the Third World. The Bill should and must be supported in its entirety because it will enable the Government to make a payment of £20 million to the International Development Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association is one of the key institutions charged with the responsibility of reducing poverty and promoting growth and development in Third World countries. The IDA's mission is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in the poorest countries in the world. The International Development Association is one of the financial arms of the World Bank which is also known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This International Development Association (Amendment) Bill amends previous Bills which date back to 1960 <Col N="42" /> when the association was founded. Ireland joined the association as a full member at the time of its foundation in 1960.</P>
    <P>The association is the single largest source of assistance to the world's 80 poorest countries. Financial assistance is provided to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income below £721 per annum. More than 80% of lending administered <i>via</i> the World Bank goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income below £507 per annum. The contribution which Ireland is making, namely, £20 million, will be given to what is known as the Twelfth Replenishment of the International Development Association. In essence this is the next financial period during which the International Development Association will allocate key grant contributions to poorer countries. More or less every three years the International Development Association receives key financial contributions from the richer countries, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The association has already stated that in the near future its key targets for reducing poverty, which will include spending the £20 million allocated by Ireland, will focus on four key areas. Financial resources will be made available to promote primary education, clean water and sanitation and preventative and reproduction health services. It is estimated that 40% of investment over the next three years administered by the International Development Association will be devoted to the social sector. This will also include promoting nutrition and social protection to address special needs such as ensuring children who must work do not sacrifice opportunities to learn.</P>
    <P>Sustainable, broad based economic growth is essential for poverty reduction. The association will support policy changes, promote projects which encourage the role of the private sector and will devote special attention to the development of small and medium sized enterprises. Good governance is critical to sustainable broad based economic development and improvements in human well being. Poor governance, including corruption, undermines the efficient and equitable provision of public goods and services and blocks opportunities for the poor and weak to benefit from the development process. The International Development Association has strengthened its framework to assess the quality of overall policy performance in recipient countries, including ensuring that such issues as open government, respect for civil and human rights and upholding the rule of law are everyday facts.</P>
    <P>The association will support strategies to promote environmentally sustainable developments since the effects of poverty and environmental damage are often mutually reinforced. The association will increase its efforts to mainstream environmental objectives in its work, taking into account local conditions and relevant international environmental agreements.</P>
    <P>The contribution which the Government is making, namely, £20 million, is part of Ireland's official development assistance programme. Tra<Col N="43" /> ditionally Ireland has been a strong supporter of the International Development Association since its foundation in 1960. Clearly, there is a close similarity between the association's main objectives and the bilateral aid programme administered by the Government. On 11 April the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, gave a comprehensive and full address to the House outlining key Government priorities in the promotion of development aid projects in the Third World. One of the greatest challenges facing the world is to provide a brighter and more prosperous future for the world's poor. He stated that the Irish development aid programme is strong in terms of policy and implementation. It is also an integral part of Irish foreign policy and a good reflection of current international policy aimed at eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development through a focus on partnerships. It also draws on contacts established in developing countries by our missionaries and NGOs who deserve our highest commendation and praise for the compassion, dedication and professionalism they show in carrying out difficult humanitarian and civil duties in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Our bilateral aid programme focuses on six countries in southern and eastern Africa where Irish aid is a significant player in helping them develop all aspects of their social and economic infrastructure. Our multilateral aid assists agencies which play leading roles in development agencies which deal with children, refugees, AIDS and other health issues, human rights, mine clearance, environmental degradation and women's issues. We have a growing programme of debt relief and a strong programme of assistance through our NGOs.</P>
    <P>While we promote our bilateral aid programme we also play an active part in promoting development and co-operation policies in the context of the EU. The EU is close to finalising its next loan convention which will set the strategic and financial guidelines for relations between the EU and 70 African, Pacific and Caribbean countries. In fact, Ireland's bilateral aid programme was reviewed by the OECD last year which found that we set high standards for aid, have demonstrated aid can work, have an undeviating focus on poverty reduction and a strong performance in putting partnerships into practice. Maintaining a reputation of quality requires patient work and a slow build up to a common understanding on which the partnership process is built. NGOs and Irish missionaries play an intrinsic part in this process.</P>
    <P>The Minister was correct when he stated on 11 April that we must not allow an exclusive focus on targets to dilute the quality of the programme or divert the Government towards a cheque writing approach to aid. However, financial resources must be made available if the bilateral aid programme administered by the Government is to expand in future. The development aid budget for 1999 is likely to amount to £178 million and the <Col N="44" /> estimated budget for 2000 is £190 million. This is the highest level ever secured for the development aid budget and cumulates in an unprecedented level of growth which has been secured in recent years. We should recall that in 1992 our development aid budget was £40 million, which is only one-fifth of the current provision. In 1999 alone the development aid budget increased by £38 million.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the statement by the Minister that the Government has not abandoned the goal of reaching the target of 0.7% of GNP, set by the UN, for our annual development aid budget. It has certainly been difficult to achieve this in recent years, primarily due to the large increase in economic growth. However, our economic growth has been the catalyst ensuring large increases in our development aid budget have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The overall goal of our development aid programme is to reduce poverty in developing countries. This is in line with international commitments and best practice, including, for example, the undertaking by donor countries at the Copenhagen Social Summit in 1995 to devote at least 20% of aid funds to the basic social sectors, namely, primary education and basic health care. The OECD donor countries have also adopted a set of targets aimed at meeting poverty related goals such as reducing infant mortality rates by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.</P>
    <P>Consistent with the approach taken by EU structural support for Ireland, development aid is seen as a structural intervention to support development in poor countries. The focus, therefore, is on economic growth as well as the distribution and consumption of resources. Aid is seen as supporting but not replacing initiatives taken by developing countries themselves. Earlier I spoke of the clear recognition which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has given to promoting Irish NGOs in the partnership process for poverty reduction in the Third World. Irish NGOs, including Trócaire, Concern and Goal, as well as our missionary sisters and priests, can often support projects at a local level where it would be difficult for public aid to do so. The partnership between Irish aid and NGOs recognises the close contacts NGOs have in many Third World countries. In 1998, for example, £20.7 million, or roughly 15% of the overseas development aid budget, was channelled through NGOs. I welcome the statement by the Minister that the role of NGOs in the programme will be strengthened in the coming years. I also welcome the fact that the Government is considering the introduction of multi-annual funding for larger NGOs which are already in receipt of block grant funding. This would facilitate them in better planning of development activities and promote a greater measure of assurance regarding fund levels.</P>
    <P>Ireland's development aid programme, which is administered in Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and Mozambique, is going from strength to strength and must be supported <Col N="45" /> at every turn, both morally and financially. The huge debt burden on poor developing countries is recognised as the major constraint to their development. It is impossible to accept a scenario whereby poorer countries face an unsustainable debt burden when they must also confront natural disasters, famine, conflict and an AIDS pandemic.</P>
    <P>The Jubilee 2000 campaign has helped to focus international attention on debt issues. For its part Ireland has never given development assistance in the form of credit. Ireland Aid is not owed money by the Governments of developing countries. Although Ireland is not a creditor the Government has allocated £31.5 million to debt relief including £22 million to the debt relief activities of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The remainder will help to service the debts of Mozambique and Tanzania. Ireland is also making financial contributions to the debt relief programme administered by the European Union. Since the beginning of the year the World Bank and the IMF have approved debt relief for five countries, including three priority countries for Ireland Aid &ndash; Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique. The front loading of debt relief for Mozambique will also help finance its reconstruction efforts after the recent severe floods.</P>
    <P>I urge all Members to support the Bill. It is a key financial instrument towards promoting the overseas development aid programme administered by the Government. This has been the case since 1960 and we must continue this process into the future. As a Member I will always support increased funding by the Government for overseas development aid programmes in the Third World.</P>

      <P>His holiness, Pope John Paul II, the Polish leader of Catholics worldwide, made a significant speech during his recent visit to the Holy Land about the Abrahamaic religions, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. It should remind us about what we can learn from others. I often meet members of the Islamic community in my constituency. Perhaps Christians could learn the importance of church going and take some time to reflect on the issues of the day. I hope Deputy Briscoe will not mind me mentioning the richness of the diversity of the formerly strong, vibrant Jewish community in Ireland, which has been lost. I hope that community becomes vibrant again because both the Jewish and Catholic traditions can learn from each other. It is by not being traditionally nationalist and looking upon community in a narrow sense that we can contribute most to international peace and understanding and that we can grasp the difficulties faced by people in other communities worldwide. If we become white, Catholic and Irish then the dangers of us feeding off our own prejudiced views become even more acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly welcome the leadership by the Chris<Col N="46" /> tian churches and the Catholic Church, in particular, and the Jewish and Islamic communities in recent times regarding the refugee issue. I am glad that they have come together to lead. We need to reflect on our attitude and contribute to various issues. We are not a mean people. When it is put to us, we contribute voluntarily but we are coming across as a mean people who have forgotten the great pain that we went through. A total of 800,000 people who were born in Ireland live in Great Britain. When I was a young boy I spoke to an individual who knew somebody who had lived through the famine. The famine was not that long ago.</P>
    <P>Materialism to some extent is replacing some of the stronger traditions which we have had in Ireland and that is regrettable. If churches want to find their feet again this is an area which they should challenge. We have seven years of feast now but we will experience seven years of famine again. It is a cyclical phenomenon. Other countries are used to going through periods of prosperity followed by recessions. We think this prosperity will last forever. It will reach a plateau but I do not suggest that there will be a great fall. However, in terms of continued growth we need to reflect on how well we are doing and how generous we are in sharing our wealth with others.</P>
    <P>A total of 14 million young children and 10 million older children and young adults in developing countries die each year from easily preventable diseases and malnutrition which can be treated cheaply. Approximately 840 million people in developing countries are malnourished. Women comprise 70% of all poverty stricken people followed closely by the elderly in such countries while 79% of the world's population lives in the Third World. A total of 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. More than 90% of the 35 million HIV or AIDS infected people live in these countries and the figure doubled between 1990 and 1997. A total of 16 million people live in the Horn of Africa. They suffer from the effects of famine and drought and their lives are in imminent danger. Life expectancy in the Third World increased by more than one third between 1960 and 1999 and infant mortality rates reduced from 76 to 58 per thousand live births demonstrating that development aid works. However, the dreadful fact remains that 1.5 billion people are not expected to survive until the age of 60 and 340 million women will die before the age of 40 in the developing world.</P>
    <P>It is time we in this House gave leadership. I want us to legislate for the 0.7% of GDP for development aid to which Ireland is committed because we will never meet it, not because the will is not there but when the Department of Finance seeks savings when the seven year famine comes along &ndash; and it does not matter who is in office &ndash; the development aid budget will be the first to be cut back. We must legislate for that contribution because no Members represent the people involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated during <Col N="47" /> a debate in the House that the cheque writing approach to this problem is not the solution. He is very much into that approach in terms of writing cheques on other countries' bank accounts. It is easy for Ireland to talk about forgiving debt when it is not a creditor nation. If we want to give leadership to others then surely we should meet the 0.7% of GDP development aid commitment and then we could talk to other people about writing cheques on their accounts.</P>
    <P>I commend Irish missionaries who have given great service worldwide, particularly in Africa. They have given their lives to the needs of others. I also commend the work of the NGOs but, as an advocate of increased expenditure on development aid, I would like to see greater accountability for that expenditure. I hope they do not take offence. We have reached a stage where we must question the existence of the multiplicity of NGOs and inquire about the number of advertising campaigns launched when terrible events occur. We must also ask whether there is not greater room for co-operation between and accountability on the part of NGOs.</P>
    <P>NGOs obtain their money from the people, whether it is in the form of Exchequer funding or through voluntary donations from members of the public. I propose that we increase the Exchequer contribution to 0.7% of GDP by 2007 which would bring it up to over £600 million, a significant amount of money. If this happens, it must be done in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General being given access to the accounts of NGOs &ndash; not merely those which detail what is done with Exchequer funding but also those which show how donations from the public are spent. Those accounts must also be made available to the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not wish to imply that there is any impropriety in this area, I am merely saying that there is an important principle at stake. I welcome the opportunity to make these points because there is a need to reflect on how we can provide leadership and make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a prominent individual recently who was publicly supportive of the concept of a Dublin Olympic bid. The person in question inquired what our chances would be if we put forward a bid to hold the Olympic Games. We considered what would happen if Dublin was in competition with another European city for the games &ndash; the reality is that, although it is not admitted, the games move from continent to continent every four years &ndash; and whether Athens, Manchester or Berlin would be ahead of us and we concluded that they would not. We also considered whether American, Australian or Asian cities would be ahead of Dublin and concluded that they would not. When it came to considering Africa, this prominent person said that Ireland is one of the few European countries which never colonised any part of Africa. All we did was to send people to serve there and we concluded that this would act in our interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> We must build on the tradition of service by citizens of this small State which is appreciated by people in Africa and we must continue to provide leadership. However, we cannot do so if we do not give in generous measure. I implore the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who is present for the debate not to be deterred by advice given by civil servants. It is nonsense to suggest that this is a Private Members' Bill. I issued a policy document on this issue but I could not introduce legislation because it would take the form of a Money Bill which cannot be introduced in Private Members' time. Money Bills can only be introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government wishes to leave behind a legacy to mark its time in office, introducing a Bill to deal with this matter would form part of that legacy. We will never meet the target to which I referred earlier unless legislation is introduced. I implore the Minister of State to use his influence in the Department of Finance to neutralise those forces which are advising against the introduction of such legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999. I congratulate the Minister of State for introducing the Bill, the purpose of which is to authorise a contribution of £20 million to the Twelfth Replenishment of the resources of the IDA.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the Bill I wish to state that following our recent debate on overseas development aid it became apparent that there are two groups of people on this planet who are, in effect, travelling in opposite directions. People in the developed world are travelling into the future at great speed and we are moving faster than any of us ever dreamed possible. Ireland is an example of a country whose economy has improved dramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, however, Third World countries are undergoing a nightmare of darkness, hunger and disease.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to strategies to tackle poverty and highlighted the existence of a poverty reduction strategy paper. Ireland put in place its own anti-poverty strategy following the World Summit in Copenhagen in 1995. It is significant that we are making great strides toward reducing unemployment, the level of which has fallen well below the EU average, and also trying to help those who cannot work by providing them with an income. However, the issues which affect Third World countries are much different from those with which we in Ireland are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why Third World issues are not discussed more often. At a recent IPU conference I attended, it was difficult to find anyone willing to discuss the question of debt and the repayment of loans. Naturally there are other issues at stake. The most major of these to arise recently in Jordan involved the question of <Col N="49" /> human trafficking in refugees. There will be a need for the House to address matters of this nature more often in the future. I was interested to discover that an IPU conference will be held in the African country Burkina Faso next year. I hope assistance will be given to that country if it has difficulty organising the conference.</P>
    <P>I congratulate those involved in the Jubilee 2000 Ireland Campaign which has lobbied for debt cancellation. At the invitation of the Jubilee 2000 committee, 800,000 Irish people signed a petition calling on the leaders of the G8 countries to cancel the unpayable debt of the world's poorest countries by the advent of the Jubilee year, 2000. These signatures were presented to the G8 leaders in Cologne, Germany, in June 1999. We are now in the middle of the jubilee year and, regrettably, the debt crisis is far from being resolved, despite the many announcements in respect of debt cancellation during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Even with the extra debt reductions, countries such as Zambia will continue to pay as much on debt repayments as on health and education combined. Mozambique, which has been in the news recently, has not had its debt cancelled, it has merely been suspended. Unless its debt is cancelled, Mozambique will be obliged to pay over $40 million annually to repay that debt. This situation is serious and the Jubilee 2000 committee has helped to highlight the need to find a resolution to it.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the implementation of the Cologne deal has been transferred to the IMF and the World Bank. I understand that these bodies announced in September last year that improvements would be made to the HIPC initiative. Jubilee 2000 believes that the HIPC initiative is not the answer to the debt issue and is of the view that pressure should be exerted on the World Bank and the IMF in respect of the easing of debt, fair trade and that they should deal with resolutions of conflict. Jubilee 2000 also makes the point that dealing with these issues would result in fewer asylum seekers and economic migrants entering the European Union.</P>
    <P>We may be lulled into a false sense of security because a number of high profile announcements on debt cancellation were made last year by President Clinton and the British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and they may give the impression that the debt crisis is almost over. However, a very low level of debt has been cancelled and much of the debt they promised to cancel is not being repaid, so significant resources will not be made available to the Governments of developing countries. No new moves have been announced by either the IMF or World Bank. Ireland is a member of both organisations which are significant creditors of low income countries. In order to achieve an effective end to the debt crisis, the IMF and World Bank must cancel unpayable debts in these poorer countries. Our current policy on debt is to support the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, known as the HIPC initiative, but over the last four years this has only delivered small <Col N="50" /> amounts of debt reduction to four countries. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is supporting the jubilee call to cancel debts of impoverished countries.</P>
    <P>At the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo recently, the Taoiseach questioned whether countries should have to repay debts at an unsustainable level while facing an AIDS epidemic. Mozambique, which was recently devastated by flooding, will be paying twice as much in servicing its debt as on basic education, even after it benefits from the myriad of debt deals already outlined. So far, Mozambique's creditors have merely suspended its debt repayments for the near future. As Mozambique is one of Ireland's aid partners and Ireland Aid is helping to repay that country's debt to the IMF and World Bank, we should call for help for Mozambique in this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the NGOs and to Irish missionaries who have been involved in helping people throughout the Third World. One of the NGOs which has been involved in bringing aid to many parts of the developing world is Trócaire. That organisation has pointed out that many lives have been saved by immunisation programmes in such countries. As a result, average life expectancy in the developing world has risen from 41 to 62 years. Of course, we all know that much more needs to be done. One fifth of the world's population still lives in absolute poverty and nearly 800 million people do not have enough to eat.</P>
    <P>In 1995, 21 of the world's richest countries, all members of the OECD, allowed their overseas aid budgets to fall to just 0.27% of GDP &ndash; the lowest level for over 20 years. In many countries we have seen overseas aid budgets being cut drastically. This matter was debated in the House recently during Private Members' time when a motion was tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell. I hope the Government will be able to state a date by which we will reach our UN targets for overseas aid. The Government has made commitments, however, particularly at various world food summits, to try and halve the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015, but that sounds like a long way in the future.</P>
    <P>When we look at the assistance we receive from the European Union, particularly the cohesion and structural funds, we can see how much more we need to help poorer countries. EU aid to Ireland in the 1994-99 period amounted to £7 billion. In other words, Ireland is receiving almost ten times more aid from the EU than it is providing in overseas development aid. The figure for EU aid is extraordinarily high when one considers other countries that have such difficult times ahead.</P>
    <P>Trócaire has also raised the issue of trade with poorer countries, making the point that rich countries, such as the USA, Japan and EU member states, dominate the World Trade Organisation. The rich countries also make the rules which restrict imports from the Third World. For example, while Europe strictly limits the import of clothes from poor countries, it lets in any <Col N="51" /> amount from the rich, developed world. At the same time, Europe subsidises its agricultural exports to poor countries, which in turn makes local produce uncompetitive and discourages food production there.</P>
    <P>Trócaire and other NGOs have called for the introduction of a clause which would link trading rights to the observance of human rights, particularly concerning child labour. The NGOs have called on multinational companies to ensure they conform to internationally agreed standards of health and safety conditions for workers in the Third World. Over 250 million children aged from five to 14 are forced to work for a living in developing countries. While the Third World has 80% of the earth's population, it accounts for only 20% of global trade. Trade levels in sub-Saharan Africa have fallen to a third of the 1960 figure.</P>
    <P>A major action plan is required to tackle the debt repayment obligations of poorer countries. An NGO representative I met recently reminded me that this year marks the 53rd anniversary of the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after the Second World War. An equivalent of the Marshall Plan is required now to help people in Third World countries. From 1982 to 1990, the world's poor nations have financed the equivalent of six Marshall Plans for the rich world through debt servicing at a total cost of $1,345 billion. We should all support the campaign by Jubilee 2000 and by NGOs for a once-off cancellation of unpayable debts in the poorest countries. Such support is needed now because the HIPC initiative has not eased the burden on the lowest income countries. One of the countries that was supposed to benefit immediately from the IMF and World Bank policies was Uganda, but it did not receive the benefit of that scheme. Instead, it resulted in a loss of $100 million for Uganda, causing further impoverishment in that country.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the denial of human rights in central Africa. We are aware of the terrible suffering caused by human rights abuses in the Sudan and Nigeria, in addition to other parts of the world such as Burma, Colombia and Mexico. There have been vicious conflicts in African countries, such as Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire, which have led to movements of hundreds of thousands of refugees, with disease and malnutrition flourishing. There has not been enough support for Africa from the international community. The first issue we need to examine is that of arms trading which should be halted. Unfair trade practices should be also discontinued and the poor countries' foreign debt burden should be relieved. In a three month period in 1994, it is estimated that 600,000 people were killed as a result of civil war and genocide in Rwanda, and over two million people fled to neighbouring countries. Almost as many were displaced internally within Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The issues that have been raised concerning <Col N="52" /> aid, trade and debt must be fully supported by the Government. I am glad that we have received good reports concerning both the quality and quantity of Irish aid to developing nations. In particular, our bilateral aid programme to priority countries has been very successful and I hope we will continue to support them. There was a time when we cut back on our allocation of overseas development aid. We have improved the situation in recent years, although we have much more progress to make in that regard. We have gone from being one of the smallest donors, as a proportion of GNP, to being in twelfth place on the list of 21 donor countries in 1998. We are still a long way behind countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, which have exceeded the United Nations target. However, we have increased significantly our ODA since 1992 and credit is due to successive Governments for their work in that regard. It is also worth mentioning the support received from communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, mentioned that aid is about poverty reduction. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, also referred to the need to reduce poverty. The reduction of poverty in different countries is, of course, a relative matter. The immunisation programme has been very successful. Diseases such as measles, malaria and pneumonia and malnutrition cause the deaths of 25,000 children per day in developing countries. The quality of Irish aid has been greatly commended in this regard. Life expectancy has also increased in developing countries.</P>
    <P>European Union transfers helped us and we could make the point that they would also help poorer countries. The fact that our economy is doing well means we can afford to increase our aid. It is in our interest to ensure that aid is of good quality and is increased.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, there was an argument in the past about ESAF. When we discuss the next replenishment, the Minister of State will examine the type of aid that is going to these countries. It is important for us to discuss these issues with our NGOs and missionaries to see if there are ways we can improve the situation. For example, given the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, there will be a lot of debate and controversy about whether we are sending aid in the right way. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has received replies from the Ethiopian Government rejecting what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said. There will be debate and controversy if we do not understand exactly what is happening in these countries.</P>
    <P>Many well off countries are involved in the arms trade and are, perhaps, arming both sides in the conflict, which is worrying. John O'Shea of GOAL has said on many occasions that we are giving money to Rwanda which is not getting to the people who need it and that we should not be giving it to the Rwandan Government. I have not heard anybody say what we should do, but we <Col N="53" /> must be careful that the money goes to the people in need. The NGOs are anxious to receive aid directly so that they can help such people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the speed with which he brought in this Bill. I hope we will look at other issues when the next replenishment of the IDA is discussed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This brief Bill is very important. The huge amount of debate on the Bill indicates the level of interest on both sides of the House. Concern about international poverty is not confined to any one party or group in the House.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association is a significant player in the battle against international poverty. It has played an important role since its inception in the 1960s. As has been pointed out, it has put US$115 billion into over 100 recipient states since then, £114 million of which has come from Ireland. This additional injection of £20 million is very welcome. Although people will say it is not enough, the reality is that there is never enough.</P>
      <P>While these figures are impressive and it is not my intention to in any way diminish them, the figure of $115 billion must be set against the type of expenditure made on other issues. For example, it pales into relative insignificance in comparison with the amount of money the developed world has spent on military infrastructure in that period. Consider, for example, the amount of money channelled into armaments, sometimes perversely under the guise of international aid. The reality is that, although a lot has been done, a huge amount still requires attention.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary extent of the challenge as we enter the 21st century has been outlined in the memorandum and in the speeches by Ministers of State and the Minister in the House. The fact that more than three billion people subsist on less than $2 per day and an additional 1.3 billion people live on less than $1 per day is an indictment of the entire developed world.</P>
      <P>The reality of Third World poverty and the debt problem has been well thrashed out and I do not want to cover the same ground. A number of speakers, including the last one, touched on the issue of debt forgiveness and the fact that Jubilee 2000 has been a very successful campaign. They rightly praised the international and national leadership of that campaign. I welcome the progress that has been made. However, I want to make two points about the institutional work that is now required.</P>
      <P>The first point is that forgiving the existing debt is one thing, but the international community bears some responsibility for putting the debt in place in the first instance. There is now a need for international bodies, such as the World Bank and the EU, to consider putting in place institutional mechanisms to prevent any recurrence of past problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Dáil discussed the debt forgiveness figure before, I suggested that the international banking community had behaved in a scandalous <Col N="54" /> manner. It threw money at corrupt regimes and put money into schemes which it knew could not possibly succeed. It did that because it knew the collateral was there because it was lending to those countries, although, in reality, it was frequently putting money into the pockets and Swiss bank accounts of despots. One institutional change which Ireland could promote would be for bodies such as the IMF to adopt lending criteria which must be applied by lending nations and institutions and to adopt an international treaty setting out sanctions against those who broke that code.</P>
    <P>The debt issue is now beginning to be addressed. As the previous speaker said, the mechanisms are somewhat cumbersome. However, we must ensure there is no recurrence. The international banking community behaved scandalously in the past and we should make absolutely certain there is no option for it to do so in the future. The statistics which face us in the developing world are staggering and they have all been trotted out here. There was a report last week by one of the US groups which looked at the issue of AIDS and disease in sub-Saharan and southern Africa. It came up with extraordinary statistics. It suggested that 25 million people are infected with AIDS and that 11 million to 13 million people have already died. There will be a whole generation of children orphaned and a whole new round of poverty.</P>
    <P>The second set of institutional changes I suggest the Government should promote is to look at the IDA's charter and at the four key options the IDA has identified for itself. One of those four options is the idea of supporting good governance. Notwithstanding the current excitements, we have some experience of institution building in this State. A good, sound and a non-corrupt administrative system of aids development, minimises the opportunities for corruption, provides links between the Government and the governed, opens communications channels, provides a framework in which human capital can be developed, provides for mobility of talented personnel, legitimises governing practices and, most importantly, underpins democracy.</P>
    <P>We have some experience as a country which suffered a colonial past. We also have, in many ways, a shared framework with many of these countries, particularly those which emerged from British colonial status &ndash; the so-called Whitehall-Westminster model of government developed between London and Dublin. We have some considerable experience in building institutions. We have a good corporate structure in our Civil Service, which has served us well. We have a very good structure and much experience, which we sometimes overlook, in the parastatal area. Our State sponsored bodies contributed in an immeasurable way to the development of this nation. Lest it be said that politicians and politics did not play its role, the reality is they did because we had a framework &ndash; a frame of reference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> I suggest Ireland could play a very real role in promoting the idea of a formal international training system. We could, for example, take responsibility for a number of states under such an institution. We could expand the work done, for example, by the Institute of Public Administration and by some of the universities over the years. I would like the Minister to bring together the IPA, the IMI, APSO, the universities, the Civil Service, State-sponsored bodies and local government to see if, in addition to providing actual capital to programmes such as the IDA programme, we could also help to provide and promote human capital in these states.</P>
    <P>The problem in the Third World will not be resolved simply by pumping funds into it, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was right, although he has been criticised for saying it. As we see in some of the cases of the corrupt regimes, it simply enriches those people who have caused the problems. The solution must come internally with support from the developed world. In addition to providing funds &ndash; I welcome this Bill because it provides the additional £20 million &ndash; we should look at other ways to underpin, support and help develop those nations and, above all, help those people to build their own solutions from within, as Trócaire does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the position of those countries to whom the IDA initiative is addressed, although perhaps we do not have enough such opportunities. I agree with Deputy Roche that the contribution which would perhaps be most effective in the next ten years would be the development of a competence on ethical governance within this county which could be exported, as it were, and developed in partnership with other countries.</P>
      <P>For many years, I have been involved in issues of aid, trade and debt as affecting these countries. I have been very much aware of the work done by organisations such as Trócaire, particularly in its structural programme, Concern, GOAL and others. What is very clear is that the transition to a sustainable lifestyle, which would take account of the indigenous cultures and of the real needs of people, shows up a deficiency in the structures of the civil society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Classically, in the Irish university and third level system, there has been an interest in what was called &ldquo;development studies&rdquo;. These, viewed in the receiving countries, have shifted in perception across a number of years. The development model was always seriously questioned by a number of countries seeking an indigenous path to development or, more accurately, a path out of extreme poverty towards sustainability. As we entered the 1990s and as we begin a new century, there is an even greater question mark over the title &ldquo;development studies&rdquo;, carrying, as it does, the uncriticised assumptions of the modernisation model as initiated in a political structure by the Princeton studies between 1958 and 1963 and as <Col N="56" /> sustained by a series of economic documents over the years. To put it rather simply, because in the short time that is all one can do, it was that we are in an inevitable near evolutionary path to development. We invite the poorest countries and countries at a lesser level of development to take part in what is an unfinished project of development in the world.</P>
    <P>This is now reaching a very sharp point of debate in many different countries. One of the most distinguished scholars to study the entire subject at global level is Manuel Castels in his three volumes just published on the information society, economics, politics and culture in which he draws on the most recent information available from the UNDP, for example. This gives us some rather stark figures. Far from there being an amelioration of conditions, there has been a significant deterioration in many countries. For example, since 1980, 1.6 billion people in 100 countries have had a fall in incomes. In 70 of those 100 countries, incomes are less than they were in 1980 and in 43 of those countries, they are less than they were in 1970. Those figures are based on the UNDP figures for 1996.</P>
    <P>As well as that, it is interesting that while at global level, between 1970 and 1985, gross national product in the world increased by 40%, the number of the poor increased by 17%. What is interesting is that this tells us about the other side of the much vaunted globalisation.</P>
    <P>There is no observable benefit in the countries I have described of a mere liberal market driven model of globalisation. Far from lifting some of these countries, it is dislodging some of their crucial expenditure on health and education towards meeting conditions which have been drawn from a paradigm which is not of their design and not suitable to their needs. The situation has deteriorated significantly in the past 25 years. Between 1970 and 1985, with gross national product in the world rising by 40 %, the number of poor rose by 17%.</P>
    <P>One can look at the figures another way, that is, in the 15 year period from 1965 to 1980, 200 million people saw their incomes fall. Between 1980 and 1993, a 13 year period and again relying on the UNDP figures for 1994, 1 billion people saw their income fall. Speaking of the countries towards which the IDA relief is directed, the poorest of the poor increased in number as did their experience of inequality, polarisation, poverty and sheer misery. It is interesting to think that if one takes the 1.2 billion people who, as I read in the Minister's and other speeches, would qualify as the poorest of the poor, 950 million of them are in south east Asia.</P>
    <P>The year before last, when I was in Cambodia, teachers in that country had their salaries reduced from $15 to $10 per month to meet the external requirements of debt service. I feel it morally incumbent upon me to draw attention to these facts lest the impression be given that, in the structure of markets internationally, and their integration, known as globalisation, there is auto<Col N="57" /> matically a train of political, social and economic restructuring taking place which will drag the poorest of the poor into the category of the poor and the poor into the category of middle income. It is not working like that.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to run side by side with what I have described the arms expenditure to which Deputy Roche, the Minister of State and other Deputies have drawn attention. If one runs arms expenditure and purchases side by side with the these figures, one finds, particularly as one enters the 1990s, a decline in real transfers of aid and an increase in arms sales. If one then looks at the pattern of structured repayments, what emerges is a truly horrific story.</P>
    <P>I have become interested in one aspect only. It is a matter of the greatest urgency that there be a critique of globalisation as the backdrop against which initiatives by any of the international institutions come to impact on the poorest countries. I have been in politics on and off for nearly 30 years. When I entered politics it was difficult to criticise the Church. Now it is far more difficult to criticise the neo-liberal economic order which prevails and which sustains globalisation. It is as if there were a single discourse in the world and there could be no other. At the same time, the basic demographic facts and life figures contradict the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister reports that the IDA will describe in its reports a situation in which life expectancy has increased. Life expectancy is falling in many countries. In the former Soviet Union, life expectancy among males is now slightly over 50 years, due to alcoholism, decline in dietary health and climatic reasons. For example, deaths from hypothermia are reported every day. Life expectancy figures are crawling down. In Cambodia, approximately four children out of five have no access to clean water, one child in three does not reach one year of age and of those who survive the first year, another third are dead before they are five years old. Of those over five years, there is an immense nutritional gap which affects learning, competence, participation and so on. This is a backdrop we sometimes do not get the time to make when we support, for example, the immediate demands of the jubilee campaign, which speaks of the writing off of debt. I am glad we have moved from speaking of rescheduling to cancelling debt, which is the only thing that makes sense.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that we can handle all the sins of the IMF and the World Bank. However, they have been mentioned by the Minister of State and others, and the models chosen as examples of restructuring are very poor. Mozambique, for example, does not stand up to scrutiny in relation to the deflection of resources from the urgent tasks of education, health, sanitation and clean water to debt service. These are not simply technical matters. Later, during questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I will deal with the issue of the 4,500 children per month who are dying in Iraq because of non-military sanctions. This is not <Col N="58" /> an administrative issue. It is not simply a matter of exchanging bits of paper. It is an outrageous implication for the children of a civilian population in the consequences of a military conflict. What is taking place cries to heaven. Statistics are helpful but so much hides behind them.</P>
    <P>One of the new gods of the neo-liberal economic order has suggested that, in the information society, there will be opportunities for Asia, Africa and Latin America to participate. When one deconstructs this piece of guff and considers the one billion television sets in the world, of which 1% are in Africa, 4% are in the Middle East, 20% are in North America, 32% are in Asia and 25% are in Europe &ndash; the Asian figure is reflective of Japan &ndash; the suggestion that an information revolution will be an instrument of globalisation and will invite the excluded parts of the planet into some participation in a humane way is seen to be totally erroneous. These countries, and an entire continent in the case of Africa, lack the basic abilities and structure for communication, not to speak of managing this transformation.</P>
    <P>One then moves across the usual structural parameters. I welcome an increased contribution. I do not quibble about that although I have a difficulty with counting our contribution to this and other multilateral agencies into the figure for overseas development aid which is then compared to the gross domestic product. Deputy Noonan spoke of the importance of being &ldquo;for real&rdquo; with the ODA figure. We should not be dislodged from making a commitment. If our growth rate as calculated means the actual sum transferred is greater, so be it. I believe there is public and cross-party support for this.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter was touched on in a thoughtful way by Deputy Roche when he spoke of the structure of debt movements and repayments. In most of the post-dictatorship societies, the society is left with the burden of payment. For example, in the case of Nicaragua after the Samosa regime, the country was blocked from access to any external payments until it signed up to pay for the Samosa debts. Another example relates to the transfers into and out of the Chilean democracy while the economy was described as modernising. What is unfair, by any moral consideration, is the idea that the succeeding population which had to struggle for generations to dislodge a dictatorship has to sign up in the international institutional order to meet the contract arrangements of international debt to be able to breathe again. This is extraordinary logic although I would not be dishonest enough to say it surprises me. It does not. I do not have time to discuss the International Monetary Fund. Some other time we can discuss the World Bank, the more humane sections within it and the tensions between the two institutions. However, what is clear from all of their internal reviews is how little the real needs of the people are fed into the structure of their programmes.</P>
    <P>I return to the case for offering models of ethi<Col N="59" /> cal governance rather than the old-fashioned development studies? I remember meeting on an aeroplane somebody with whom I had studied in the United States in the 1960s. He was carrying a very large briefcase. When I asked him where he was going he said that he was going to one of the former territories of the Soviet Union. When I asked him what he was doing he said, &ldquo;I am doing consultancy and I never thought this stuff would be useful again. I just dug it out of the filing cabinet&rdquo;. He had all the material that we had learned &ndash; the old modernisation model of the 1960s. He was recycling the old bankrupt advice in the name of consultancy to societies and communities which were restructuring themselves. That is why there is a need not only to take a very long, hard, critical look at institutions but also, much more particularly, to supplement the internal studies conducted by the different organisations, including the ones conducted within the IDA, with external studies to determine what our response is to the opinion of the people on what is being done in their name.</P>
    <P>I am not underestimating what is a real issue for anyone involved in the practice of politics or reflecting on politics, that is, the balance between sovereignty and people's needs. Most of the countries which have moved quickly from a colonised status &ndash; I welcome the use of that word; there was at least a ten or 15 year period in which it could not be used &ndash; value to an almost extreme degree sovereignty which sometimes serves as a block for transparency which is of importance in relation to national transfers.</P>
    <P> The Minister said, &ldquo;If the globalisation of finance, labour markets, communication and commerce is inevitable then the globalisation of rights and responsibilities must follow&rdquo;. I heartily agree. If this is a case for a universalisation of ethics I am in favour of it but what we are getting is deterritorialised accountability. There is no accountability. Given our history, connections and the wish of all sides of the House and the public, it is very important that we be of assistance. Perhaps the best thing we can do is take a good hard look at the international market model and expose it for what it really is, a new wave of market colonisation, not a liberating set of instruments as it is frequently described.</P>
    <P>Even in a time of intolerance when economics has become unhinged from the political economy which has become unhinged from our sensibility, it is important that we make this case and help as much as possible in allowing an alternative model to come into existence which will take account of real indigenous needs and capacity to live and make the transitions required if we are to put the statistics into better shape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The welcome given by Deputies to the Bill is very much appreciated. It was gratifying to note that Deputies were broadly supportive of the IDA and its emphasis on help<Col N="60" /> ing the poorest countries and that they support the commitment of £20 million to the Twelfth Replenishment. The debate on the three yearly replenishment of the IDA offers the Legislature the opportunity to reflect trends and developments in multilateral development assistance and the debate on the IDA 12 Bill has lived up to expectations. I wish to touch on a number of points raised by Deputies and elaborate on some of the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>I wish to remark on the IDA's approach to poverty reduction, the central theme of its work. The IDA recognises that its impact on poverty can be judged only by the results which its operations achieve in the field. For the Twelfth Replenishment a number of priorities have been agreed by IDA donors. These will focus on investment in people, which has been shown to be vital for development. It will also promote broad based development and encourage sectoral reforms which promote labour intensive growth and benefit the poor.</P>
      <P>Specifically, IDA 12 will give priority to investments in education, health and social programmes; reduction in non-productive expenditure such as excessive military spending; pro-poor policy reforms, especially those which address the needs of the rural poor, small farmers and micro-enterprises; policies to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources; assuring the access of the poor to land, credit and information; establishing basic labour standards and reforming legislation and policies which disadvantage the poor.</P>
      <P>Education provides major economic, social, cultural and institutional benefits. A new education sector strategy is being prepared by the IDA which is expected to provide a framework for deepening the policy dialogue with the world's poorest countries on the options for rapidly increasing access to quality basic education with a focus on making better use of Government, donor and private resources. In this context, Deputy Deenihan's suggestion regarding the donation of out-of-date school books to developing countries will be explored.</P>
      <P>The question of governance was covered. I stress the importance of this aspect of development in relation to IDA support. It has increasingly been recognised that good governance is essential to economic development and the effectiveness of development assistance. The IDA 12 negotiations identified four dimensions of governance which are particularly important to economic development, poverty reduction and the effective use of IDA resources. These are accountable and competent public institutions, transparent economic and social policies and practices, a predictable and stable legal framework and participation by affected groups and civil society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA lending will be selective in identifying those countries which achieve progress in implementing policy reform programmes, where needed. In particular, it will identify instances of <Col N="61" /> poor governance and corruption. The experience of overseas development aid in recent decades has amply demonstrated that these and, in particular, corruption tend to undermine development and constrain aid effectiveness. Corruption also creates barriers to the effective promotion of private sector development, raising costs and reducing growth. Gender inequality is also inimical to growth in that it deprives a nation of a significant part of its productive assets. Discrimination due to caste, race, ethnicity or religion is also a significant barrier to growth and can even undermine the results already achieved when it leads to civil conflict.</P>
    <P>The IDA and the World Bank are committed to addressing the problems of institutional weakness combined with inappropriate or unenforced policy or legal frameworks which often permit corruption to flourish. The IDA recognises that addressing these problems will require a long-term effort, particularly in building up the institutional capacity to make the necessary changes. It will require a strong commitment on the part of the Governments concerned. Such Governments will receive appropriate assistance in their efforts.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I think it is desirable that this matter conclude so if I could just finish this point. The IDA's mandate will also take into account issues such as democratisation and respect for human rights which can also have important long-term implications for the capacity of a country to initiate and sustain programmes for effective poverty reduction, economic adjustment and growth. It is unfortunate that there is no time to conclude this speech but I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the highly significant developments that have taken place in recent days. The initiative taken by the two Governments, and the IRA's response, map out a clear way forward through which we can secure the restoration of the executive and the Assembly and the full implementation of Good Friday Agreement with clarity as to how all of the outstanding elements are to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> In the period since the executive and the Assembly were suspended in February, the Government has been engaged in the most intensive discussions with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to bring about their earliest possible restoration. As a result of these discussions, on 5 May the two Governments issued a statement expressing their belief that the remaining steps necessary to secure full implementation of the Agreement can be achieved by June 2001. An account of these steps setting out the Governments' proposals and commitments in the areas of rights and equality, security, policing and justice and prisoners was circulated to the parties. The Governments stated that, subject to a positive response to their statement, the British Government will bring forward the necessary order to enable the Assembly and the executive to be restored by 22 May.</P>
    <P>The Governments also called on paramilitary organisations to urgently state that they will put their weapons completely and verifiably beyond use. In a statement on 6 May, the IRA said it will resume contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. It also identified the context in which the IRA will completely and verifiably put its arms beyond use and said that its guns are silent and secure. In what has rightly been regarded as a highly significant and unprecedented confidence building measure, the IRA agreed to the regular inspection by agreed third parties, who will report to the de Chastelain commission, of a number of its arms dumps to confirm the security of its weapons. Furthermore, the IRA repeated that it does not pose any threat to the peace process and that it looked forward to a context in which political objectives can be pursued peacefully.</P>
    <P>This statement has been widely welcomed as offering a commitment in explicit terms to put arms beyond use and as indicating the process by which this is to be achieved under the de Chastelain commission. It undoubtedly represents a significant and historic advance on the part of the republican movement and we hope that loyalist paramilitaries will respond in similar terms.</P>
    <P>The parties are now studying the Governments' proposals. For our part, we stand ready to offer whatever clarification the parties consider helpful. In relation to the process of third party inspection of IRA arms dumps, we are most fortunate to have secured the agreement of former President of Finland, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, and former Secretary General of the ANC, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, to head the inspections and to report to the de Chastelain commission. Details of the inspection process will be worked out in the coming period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The House will be aware that on 9 May the Chief Constable announced a number of normalisation steps in initial response to the weekend's developments. These steps are welcome and it is important that progress be maintained on this issue on the basis set out in our statement.</P>
    <P>The discussions in which we have been engaged have been difficult and complex. The issues are extremely sensitive and of great significance to <Col N="63" /> both communities, but I firmly believe that we have succeeded in identifying a way forward in which all of the issues will be dealt with in a manner which meets the fundamental needs of all sides. I greatly hope it will be possible for all of the parties to respond positively so that we can move forward together, and so that the full potential and promise of the Agreement can be realised.</P>

      <P>Having served in the Department of Foreign Affairs I am sure that there are very skilled civil servants who know how to time a reply to two minutes. I hope that we will have such replies in future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the IRA's statement which is a signal development and I hope it contributes to removing the personal pressure on Gerry Adams and David Trimble. I also hope the statement helps to bring about a broader shouldering of that pressure. Would the Minister of State agree that this move by the IRA needs a realistic response from Unionists? I use the word &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; in a proper sense. Would she also agree that, in order to bring this about, David Trimble needs support and encouragement? What steps has the Government taken to provide that support and encouragement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has recognised, as has everyone, the significance and substance of the IRA's statement. This was a very significant development which should not be taken for granted by anyone.</P>
      <P>As regards the Government's efforts to clear up other outstanding matters, all the parties are now considering the various proposals which are in the public domain and it is hoped that, over the coming days, progress can be made on some of these issues.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to efforts to help Mr. Trimble in this and the issue of policing has been mentioned. Policing is such a complex and sensitive issue that the parties to the Agreement felt it best to set up an independent commission to make proposals for a police service which would be acceptable and representative of both communities. Chris Patten and his colleagues did an excellent job in coming forward with a very authoritative set of proposals which struck a balance between the requirements and aspirations of both communities. The Patten commission's recommendations on the various issues are clear, including those on the name of the police service and the badge.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made it clear that every effort is being made to respond to outstanding issues which have been raised by the parties. This is a time for people to work together and to be moderate in everything they say in order to achieve consensus and agreement to move forward on the basis of the historic achievement which has, on the one hand, been achieved by the IRA's statement and, on the other hand, by the agreement of the British Government and the parties to re-establish the institutions.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the suffering of the people of Iraq, especially children, and the problems in implementing international humanitarian aid programmes as a result of sanctions.</P>
      <P>Within the United Nations and the EU we have expressed our concerns about the humanitarian situation. The Taoiseach and I raised this issue directly with the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington in March and urged the United States, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to seek to rectify the difficulties under the sanctions programme.</P>
      <P>The council clearly needs to take full account of the grave humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people in its further consideration of the sanctions issue. In particular, we advocate further reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. The new UN humanitarian aid co-ordinator, Tun Myat, drew attention to this issue when he took up duty in Baghdad on 30 April.</P>
      <P>The imposition and administration of the sanctions primarily remain a matter for the Security Council. The council continues to impose sanctions on Iraq as a result of that Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN special commission appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The council is acting within the powers and responsibilities conferred on it under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Article 41 of the Charter empowers the Security Council to interrupt economic relations where it has determined there is a threat to international peace. Ireland stands by its obligation under Article 25 of the Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the council. This is binding upon all UN member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The Security Council adopted a comprehensive resolution, No. 1284, last December in which it provided for the suspension and ultimate lifting of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with the military or, more properly, disarmament provisions of the resolution. The resolution unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies and includes a number of other measures aimed at easing the negative effect of sanctions on the civilian population.</P>
    <P>On 14 April, the Security Council approved the blueprint for the new UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission &ndash; UNMOVIC &ndash; headed by Hans Blix, a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The blueprint emphasises the need to ensure the independence of the commission's members and the confidentiality of their work to avoid accusations of espionage such as Iraq levelled at its predecessor, UNSCOM. Under Resolution 1284 sanctions can be suspended if Iraq allows arms inspectors to start work and co-operates fully with them. Mr. Blix has stated that the commission will be ready to begin work in August. Iraq has stated that it will not allow UNMOVIC start work. We hope the Iraqi Government will reverse this decision.</P>
    <P>Acting under Resolution 1284, the Secretary General has reviewed the delays on contracts. On 24 March, the members of the council agreed to make a greater allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil industry, doubling this budget to $1.2 billion. They also expressed strong concern, which we share, about the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. Since then, $110 million worth of contracts have been cleared. The council had earlier introduced an accelerated procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies; this has been in operation since 1 March. We welcome these steps.</P>
    <P>An open debate on the general question of sanctions took place in the Security Council on 17 April. Ireland was centrally involved in ensuring that humanitarian concerns were presented in the common statement by the EU Presidency. We welcomed the Security Council decision following that debate to establish guidelines for a working group on United Nations sanctions. The council members made clear that sanctions regimes should be carefully defined and focused and tailored to the particular situation in which they are to be applied. They also discussed the streamlining of procedures for approving humanitarian exemptions, as well as a study on how to avoid negative collateral effects of sanctions on third countries.</P>
    <P>I urge the Iraqi Government to comply with Security Council resolutions, particularly in relation to disarmament, as well as to co-operate adequately with the UN oil for food programme, and in particular to ensure equitable distribution to the civilian population of supplies made available under that programme. I am hopeful that, with the necessary co-operation from Baghdad, greater progress can be made in reducing suffering and hardship in Iraq.</P>

He gave me an outline of our UN obligations. That is not in question. The Minister of State, on Tuesday, 7 April, said she was against sanctions on non-military aid to Iraq. Is that the Department's view? If it is, what consideration or response has the Department given to Denis Halliday's report on his retirement as co-ordinator of humanitarian relief or on Hans Von Sponeck's report when he resigned as co-ordinator of humanitarian relief?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that perhaps 4,500 children per month are dying because of the intransigent continuation of sanctions against a civilian population? Does she agree that there is a moral question involved when 4,500 children per month must die if the sanctions continue indefinitely? What information has been secured from either the United States Government or the British Government in response to the Von Sponeck report or to Denis Halliday's report? Does the Department propose to issue a comment on Denis Halliday's report, which led to his resignation?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the terrible humanitarian impact of these sanctions on the children of Iraq. On every opportunity that has arisen, the Government and its officials have raised our concerns about the humanitarian impact of the sanctions.</P>
      <P>An open debate on the general question of sanctions took place in the Security Council on 17 April.

      <P>In relation to the humanitarian aspects, we have supported the humanitarian aid effort. We made an emergency humanitarian grant of £100,000 to the Red Cross last year to assist in its relief work in areas such as medical support for the victims of war, prisoners' welfare and water and sanitation. There is a proposal under consideration in the Department for a further allocation of £150,000 to UNICEF in this regard.</P>

One is talking about the remaining 20%, most of which were supplied by the countries that are imposing the sanctions. One is left with the scandal of the civilian population being asked to suffer as a result of the continuation of these sanctions.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it acceptable that there be an indefinite extension of the no-fly zone, which affects the civilian population, across a major portion of Iraq? Is she aware that the oil for food programme included an objection to pencils going to Iraq from Jordan because they contained lead? Will the Minister undertake to place in the Oireachtas Library a response from the Department to the Halliday and Von Sponeck resignations and an up-to-date report on the present position?

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has been under way since mid-February with, to date, six meetings of the preparatory group of personal representatives and three at ministerial level in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs participated. The preparatory group has completed a preliminary round of discussions on the three issues unresolved from Amsterdam, namely, the size and composition of the Commission, weighting of votes in the Council and the extension of qualified majority voting or QMV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also received a report from the friends of the Presidency group on reform of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, and has <Col N="68" /> briefly reviewed changes in the European Parliament and other institutions necessitated by enlargement. These will be considered in more detail in subsequent phases of the Intergovernmental Conference's work. The group of personal representatives had an initial discussion on the topic of flexibility, that is, closer co-operation by a limited number of member states at the informal meeting in Sintra on 14-15 April.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the Presidency, under its own responsibility, will present a comprehensive report on progress in the Intergovernmental Conference to the Feira European Council on 19-20 June. It is anticipated that this will outline the stage of discussion reached under the various headings and suggest approaches as to how the work might be taken forward under the French Presidency. As agreed at Helsinki, there is also provision for the Presidency to put forward for consideration at Feira possible additions to the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. Any decisions on this matter would, of course, require the agreement of the European Council.</P>
    <P>As regards progress to date, the House will appreciate that discussions are at an early stage, with the focus thus far on the presentation of national positions. In this regard the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear our strong commitment to maintaining the right of each member state to nominate a Commissioner. The indications are that this view is supported by a considerable number of other member states. With regard to QMV, we are prepared to consider sympathetically the scope for extension of QMV, examining each area on a case by case basis. However, we have also indicated that in a number of areas, including taxation, unanimity should be retained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke on the challenges facing the Union in his recent meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and in his address last month to the Institute of European Affairs. I note also that the Government's personal representative, Mr. Noel Dorr, recently briefed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on developments in the Intergovernmental Conference. We will continue to keep the House apprised of developments as the negotiations proceed.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is scheduled to conclude at the European Council in Nice in December. The Government and the other member states are anxious to meet this deadline to avoid delaying the timetable for enlargement. The work of the conference can therefore be expected to intensify further over the coming months. We will continue to work for an outcome which maintains the essential balances within the Union while, at the same time, preparing the Union for the challenges and opportunities of enlargement.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State share my concerns about statements in recent days by former German Chancellor Schmidt, former French President Giscard d'Estaing and former President of the Commission Mr. Jacques Delors about the need for flexibility and the way this has been conveniently taken up by Chancel<Col N="69" /> lor Schröder and the French President? What need is there for flexibility? This seems to be an old agenda which has been revived for the sake of it. If we were to allow flexibility, I do not know where we would allow it. Why is this agenda being pushed by the German and French Governments, in particular, at this time? What view does the Government take of this agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are indications of growing support for flexibility, that is, co-operation between a limited number of member states. In keeping with Ireland's position during the Amsterdam negotiations, the Government will be prepared to consider appropriate flexibility provisions but will wish to be assured that they will serve the overall interests of the Union.</P>
      <P>There are a number of examples of flexibility, including Economic and Monetary Union, in which Ireland participates. However, Ireland has generally taken a cautious approach on the question of extending flexibility because of concern that it would undermine the Union's internal coherence and even perhaps fragment the external perception of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from any of the statements which have been made by Ministers or other European Ministers why they want this flexibility and the areas in which they want flexibility? Ireland has joined in all of the areas of flexibility except the Schengen Agreement because of the difficulty of the common travel area with Britain. If this flexibility is required for common defence purposes, will Ireland be in the vanguard of those nations making use of this flexibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to the earlier question, Ireland has taken a cautious approach to this concept of flexibility. While the question of the shape of the final agenda is a matter for the Feira European Council, flexibility arises in any event in the context of discussion on qualified majority voting. The specific form of the inclusion of flexibility on the agenda is to that extent a procedural rather than a substantive point. I am not in a position at this stage to state definitively Ireland's position on flexibility on the matter of defence policy.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned at the breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and the ongoing violence, loss of life, illegal occupation of property and continuing political intimidation in the run-up to Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections. We have brought our serious concern at these tragic events to the attention of the authorities in Zimbabwe on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Ambassador in South Africa is also accredited to Zimbabwe. He maintains close con<Col N="70" /> sultations with his EU counterparts and has kept the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government informed of developments. We have instructed that an embassy officer remain in the country to provide the necessary consular protection for the Irish community there. The Ambassador is in Harare at present. All possible steps to ensure the safety of Irish citizens are being taken.</P>
    <P>About 2,000 Irish passport holders live in Zimbabwe. Irish citizens have been asked to update the information about them which our embassy in Pretoria has and to register with the British High Commission in Harare as well. The British High Commission is including Irish citizens in its contingency planning, but evacuations are not envisaged by them or by any of the EU missions at this stage. Irish citizens visiting Zimbabwe are being advised to exercise caution and not to visit commercial farms, venture off main roads nor travel by night.</P>
    <P>In recent months, together with our EU partners, the Government has expressed its concern at the situation to the authorities on a number of occasions. In March, following the illegal occupation of farms and the escalation of outbreaks of violence, we called on the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure respect for the law and maintain public order and civil protection. In April, diplomatic efforts to resolve the differences between Britain and Zimbabwe took place at the Africa-Europe Summit in Cairo, which I attended with the Taoiseach. Since the conflict began, EU Foreign Ministers have called on the Government of Zimbabwe, both in April and most recently at the informal meeting in Portugal last weekend, to take the steps necessary to resolve the deteriorating situation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The European Union is Zimbabwe's principal development partner. Together with other member states the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to orderly and transparent agrarian reform which respects the rights of all citizens and is compatible with the economic and development requirements of the country. The illegal occupation of farms has already led to tragic acts of violence. It seriously undermines the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and is unacceptable in a democratic country. In this context, we condemned the legislation passed in the Zimbabwe Parliament allowing confiscation of farmland without compensation, and called on the Government of Zimbabwe to comply with the Court order of 17 March to end the illegal occupation. We have also reiterated our support for land resettlement within the rule of law and on the basis of the principles and conclusions of the 1998 Land Reform and Resettlement Conference, which were agreed by the parties concerned at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The Government has stressed the fundamental importance of respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law, and has appealed, together with its EU partners, to the Government of Zimbabwe to create the conditions for holding free and fair elections in the near future, within the timetable prescribed by the Zimbabwean constitution. We have offered <Col N="71" /> our assistance towards ensuring that these electoral conditions are fully met. In this context, we welcome the recent announcement by the Government of Zimbabwe that it will accept international election observers and have underlined the importance of these observers being present in sufficient numbers at as early a date as possible to observe the pre-election process, and to ensure that democratic principles are respected.</P>
    <P>Ireland was a long-standing supporter of the Zimbabwean independence movement. The Government will continue to support all peaceful efforts to resolve the current difficulties, and to ensure that the democracy which the people of Zimbabwe worked so hard to achieve will continue to grow and prosper.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that, in addition to the 2,000 Irish passport holders living in Zimbabwe, it is likely that there are a number of others who surrendered their Irish passports and took Zimbabwean citizenship in the belief that that was the right thing to do with the new horizons which they thought would arise in Zimbabwe? Would she agree that 40 or 50 of those passport holders are white farmers or are in the employment of white farmers? Would she further agree that the behaviour of President Mugabe is totally reprehensible and unacceptable; and would she consider calling in the Zimbabwean Ambassador to Ireland with a view to making clear the Government's concerns?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of those former Irish citizens to which the Deputy refers. My notes tell me that there are 2,000 Irish citizens undertaking a number of occupations, of whom fewer than 20 are farmers. As I already mentioned, an Irish diplomatic officer remains in Harare with a view to liaising with the Irish community and the authorities there. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made by our staff to assist any Irish person or even an Irish person who has taken on Zimbabwean citizenship.</P>
      <P>We would be very concerned about the safety of citizens while the political situation remains unstable. We are carefully monitoring the position. We are concerned about the activities, statements and aggressive political activity of President Mugabe and, in common with our EU partners, we are carefully watching the situation hoping it will not deteriorate.</P>

Will the Minister of State call in the Zimbabwean Ambassador to Ireland and ensure that he is directly apprised of the concerns of the Government regarding what is happening there?</P>

      <P>The Government welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister Mr. Blair on 29 January 1998, of the establishment of a new, independent, judicial tribunal of inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday. The objective of the Bloody Sunday inquiry is to find out what happened in Derry on 30 January 1972. The tribunal began its public oral hearings in the Guildhall in Derry on 27 March last and this marked an important step forward in the task of fully and finally establishing the truth about that tragic day.</P>
      <P>The Government has maintained close and regular contact with the Bloody Sunday relatives and injured, their legal representatives and members of the Bloody Sunday Trust in the past and we will continue to do so during this substantive phase of the tribunal's work.</P>
      <P>We attach great importance to the progress and outcome of the inquiry. In this context, officials of my Department have monitored the work of the tribunal since its inception. Furthermore, an officer has been specifically assigned to monitor the inquiry's public oral hearings and has been attending these hearings since their commencement as the Government's official observer. It is intended to maintain this presence throughout the course of the inquiry's public hearings, which are expected to continue for two years.</P>

Having requested the establishment of the tribunal we would, of course, respect the independence of the Saville Tribunal. While we wish Lord Saville and his team well in their difficult task, counsel for the tribunal is currently making his opening statement during which he will set out the documentary and other material which has become available to the tribunal. This presentation does not express the views of the tribunal but does identify certain questions and issues which may need to be addressed. The tribunal will not express a view until the presentation of evidence has been concluded. We are monitoring very carefully the ongoing developments at the tribunal and, having called for its establishment, take a very close interest in its ongoing developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>Contributions by Ireland Aid to multilateral organisations account for between 35% and 40% of total ODA expenditure. A significant proportion of Ireland's multilateral ODA is mandatory, including most of our contributions to the UN, the World Bank Group and the UN's agricultural and food agencies.</P>
      <P>The 1996 White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy stated that Ireland's multilateral contributions should be used to further the aims of our development policy in a way that is consistent with our relationship with the developing world. Contributions to multilateral organisations conform as closely as possible with priority areas of Irish development co-operation policy. These priorities include poverty reduction, self-reliant development, human resources, gender issues, the environment and sustainable development, food security, human rights and democratisation.</P>
      <P>Ireland's share of the EU's development budget is approximately £30 million. In addition, we contribute £10 million per year to the European Development Fund. We, therefore, have a national interest in ensuring that EU aid is delivered effectively and goes directly to those most in need.</P>
      <P>A number of recent external evaluations have highlighted problems in the EU aid programme. Internal EU financial controls are bureaucratic and complex leading to long delays in the disbursement of aid. Decision making on EU aid needs to be decentralised to the field to allow for greater flexibility. There are too many financial instruments and there is no overall EU statement on development policy governing aid. These problems have led to a large build up of unspent balances which now amount to over £10 billion. They also hamper the effective delivery of aid. The EU's failure to quickly replenish the Ethiopian Food Reserve is the most glaring recent example.</P>
      <P>The next meeting of the EU Development Council on 18 May will consider the results of these external evaluations and will be hearing from Commissioner Nielson on his plans for the reform of the management of Community aid. The Commission is preparing a major overhaul of the EU aid administration and has presented a communication setting out the main elements of an over-arching EU development policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming months there will be intensive discussions about the future reform of EU aid. A concerted effort will be made to put in place a more efficient system designed to ensure the rapid disbursement of funds and to deal with the problem of the accumulated unspent balances. <Col N="75" /> Ireland's voluntary contributions to the UN and other international development agencies have been increasing in recent years. The total allocation for voluntary contributions in 2000 is £12.045 million. The three principal UN development agencies &ndash; UNDP, UNICEF and the UNHCR &ndash; remain the largest recipients of our voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>In allocating funding to multilateral institutions, Ireland emphasises the need to focus on poverty reduction, particularly in the poorest countries. We also encourage close co-operation between all donors, bilateral and multilateral, with the recipient governments. We support management reforms in the major funding agencies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. To help achieve these objectives, Ireland plays an active role on the executive boards of multilateral institutions. Ireland joined the joint executive board of the UN Development Programme &ndash; UNDP &ndash; and the UN Population Fund &ndash; UNFPA &ndash; in January 1998, for a term of three years. We will become a board member of the World Food Programme in 2001 and of UNICEF in 2002. We are a permanent member of the executive committee of the UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>
    <P>We have also been strong supporters of the UN reform process launched in 1997 by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This process is improving the co-ordination and effectiveness of UN development agencies at country level. The UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF have all moved to results based budgeting, introduced farreaching management reforms and decentralised their operations to the field.</P>
    <P>The multilateral aid programme is an integral component of our overall development co-operation activities. We are working with our partners in the EU and with the UN to ensure that aid delivered through multilateral channels is effective, efficient and reaches those most in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the concern, particularly among NGOs, about the need to ensure that the aid for which they work so hard and which she and others provide so generously, is directed in such a way as to avoid or eliminate the possibility of it being used as an indirect subsidy for other activities by some recipient countries? In other words, can she ensure that the aid is going directly to those who are most in need and to what extent is she motivating the international community in that regard? This is a growing concern which needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned and frequently reminded by NGOs, particularly Irish NGOs with whom we have an ongoing relationship, that a greater amount of Irish overseas development assistance should be guaranteed to reach the people most in need. NGOs feel they do this best. The Government must take a balanced approach in this regard. Clearly there is a <Col N="76" /> need for a balance in our mix of activities. We are currently reviewing how we spend our overseas development assistance and considering ways to ensure that Irish NGOs, particularly those which are operational, can have a more satisfactory relationship in terms of allocations by the Department. There is a need for the multilateral aspects. Our multilateral contributions, club memberships and voluntary contributions to UN agencies are a very significant part of our overseas development endeavours.</P>
      <P>Similarly, our government to government or bilateral programme is extremely important. At the beginning of the overseas development programme, 70% of the ODA budget was given through multilateral contributions. This is now approximately 40% and is probably a more satisfactory balance of contributions on the multilateral side. However, we are evaluating the effectiveness of our multilateral contributions which are significantly increased this year mainly because of increased activity on the UN aid side and also significant additional support for the UNHCR.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 73 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on numerous occasions over the past number of weeks. These meetings, together with the other extensive contacts which have taken place between the governments and the parties, resulted in the initiative announced by the governments on 5 May in which we expressed our belief that the remaining steps necessary to secure full implementation of the Agreement can be achieved by June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two governments in their statement on 5 May stated that, subject to a positive response to their initiative, the British Government will bring forward the necessary order to enable the Assembly and Executive to be restored by 22 May. The parties are now studying these pro<Col N="77" /> posals. For our part, we stand ready to offer whatever clarification the parties consider helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information as to whether that matter was raised. I missed two or three of the most recent meetings as I was abroad. Recent meetings have been confined exclusively to dealing with the resolution of our difficulties in regard to the restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Intensive consultations are ongoing in regard to preparations for the Ulster Unionist Council meeting. There are some outstanding issues following on the successful resolution of the main obstacle to progress, namely the issue of the disarmament of illegal weapons. That has been substantively resolved. The two Governments are working intensively to resolve the outstanding issues and telephone and other conversations with the parties and between the Governments are ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Government protest to the British Government about the leaking of the document regarding the meeting between the Secretary of State Mr. Mandelson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, if so, what form did that protest take? Second, did the Secretary of State and the Minister discuss the issue of &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo; and the recent statements of the Victims Commissioner in regard to the location of bodies? Does the Minister expect that progress will be made on that matter in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that we do not comment on leaked documents which purport to be reports of conversations between ministers. Clearly, the only motivation behind the leak was to disrupt or subvert the work of the Governments at the time which, happily, did not succeed.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in my supplementary briefings on the matter of &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo; which is probably the subject of a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the view which I have put forward for several years that the issue of policing is the potential Achilles' heel of any settlement in the North and that the acid test of a durable settlement will be the capacity of the police service to attract young men and women from Unionist and Nationalist backgrounds into its ranks who will not feel any less Unionist or Nationalist by being policemen <Col N="78" /> and policewomen? Does the Minister agree that being Protestant and Catholic is not sufficient and that the young people should represent their traditions and come from areas where the attachments about which I spoke are strongly felt? In those circumstances, does the Minister feel that the wholehearted and speedy implementation of the recommendations of the Patten report is a prerequisite and that without a police service which is acceptable to both traditions in the North and which will be fully supported by adherents of both traditions&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Does she agree that in those circumstances the new institutional and constitutional arrangements will almost inevitably fail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the formation of a new start to policing, namely the establishment of a police service in Northern Ireland which would gain the allegiance and participation of both sections of the community was a fundamental requirement of the Good Friday Agreement. It was such a basic, essential and sensitive issue that the parties to the Agreement established an independent commission to draw up proposals for reform. Those proposals have been accepted by the Governments and the Secretary of State has indicated that they will be implemented in full. We look forward to those reforms being legislated for.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Deputy that all of the work we have done in dealing with the problematic issue of paramilitary weapons could be set at nought if the issue of policing is reopened. It is very important that progress would be achieved, as envisaged under the Agreement, to create a police service which will be truly representative of the people of Northern Ireland. If that fundamental outcome is not achieved, all the reforms in the world will be useless. The police service must be an organisation which will attract the participation of young Nationalists in large numbers as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that for understandable historical reasons, a community in the North has had a negative attitude to the State and its institutions for many generations and that such an attitude will not be transformed overnight? That is why it is essential that the Patten recommendations be fully implemented and that young men and women from both sections of the community in Northern Ireland would be represented in the police service. I refer particularly to people who join the Garda and those from the Nationalist community who would be members of the GAA. It will be sufficiently difficult to sell any new police service without the non-implementation of the Patten recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been resolute in its view that the full implementation of the Patten proposals is fundamental if the purpose of reforming the RUC is to be achieved. The only true test of that will be whether young Nationalists or Catholics throughout Northern Ireland will join the new police service. It is very important when speaking about constitutional issues to remember that the Good Friday Agreement, while confirming the principle of consent, also required that the power of whichever Government was sovereign would be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all of the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions. In other words, it is essential that there would be parity of esteem and just and equal treatment of the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities. I agree with Deputy Currie's knowledge and understanding of the sensitivities of this issue within the Nationalist community, in particular, and that it is essential that the Patten proposals are fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the issue of the RUC in the course of the first question and do not wish to revisit it now. In regard to the creation of a better understanding between the Unionist and Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and between Nationalists and Unionists on the island as a whole, does the Minister agree that the extension of the reception of RTE and TG4 in Northern Ireland would be very beneficial? Given that we receive UTV and BBC Northern Ireland here, we are probably better informed about issues of concern to Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland than they are about issues of concern to us or about everyday happenings in the Republic. Will the Minister confirm that the matter of extending RTE, TG4 and TV3 services into Northern Ireland is on the agenda and has been discussed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was included in the joint statement of the two Governments on 5 May. Technical discussions on the steps required to further extend TG4 reception in Northern Ireland will continue and other measures, including a two year Irish language television and film production pilot scheme due to start by April 2001, will also be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The convention which was established to elaborate a draft charter of fundamental rights has been meeting regularly, in both formal and informal session, to discuss elements for inclusion in the draft charter. The convention will meet today and tomorrow to have an exchange of views on, <i>inter alia</i>, the preamble to, <Col N="80" /> and the structure of, the charter. Detailed discussions have already taken place on draft wording for certain rights, including social rights, civil and political rights, rights of the citizen and also on horizontal aspects. Discussions on the draft articles will continue in further meetings of the convention. I understand the chairman of the convention, Mr. Roman Herzog, has indicated that it is hoped to have available a full set of draft articles by the 23rd of this month. Copies of the draft articles, submissions to the convention and reports of meetings are available on the convention's comprehensive website.</P>
      <P>One of the fundamental issues which has yet to be resolved in the convention is the scope of the application of the charter, whether it should be in respect of the Union only and in respect of all or only some of its activities, or in respect of the member states also. The Government has already indicated a preference for the charter to take the form of a political declaration rather than a legally binding text and that remains the Government's view.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's representative at the convention, Deputy O'Kennedy, has been keeping the Government informed about progress in the discussions. Regular updates are provided to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on European Affairs. Consideration is currently being given to the submission by the Taoiseach's representative of written suggested amendments to the draft articles which will be drafted with the assistance of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General. Deputy O'Kennedy and his alternate, Mr. Mahon Hayes, also actively participate in the meetings of the convention, including the drafting sessions. There is open access to all these meetings.</P>

      <P>I take it from what the Minister said that the fundamental right to life is not an issue which need cause any concern here and will remain a domestic issue for consideration by us and the Joint Committee on the Constitution which is considering the matter.</P>
      <P> Is racism and xenophobia being addressed in particular under this review of fundamental rights? In this context how does the Minister see the role of the EU dovetailing with the role of the Council of Europe in terms of preventing duplication and ensuring the matters are addressed urgently, efficiently, effectively and with sanity? There seems to be some very extreme movements towards racism and xenophobia throughout Europe, including in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the establishment of the convention is that the European Council in Cologne in 1999 decided there was a need to establish a charter of fundamental rights to make the overriding importance and relevance of such rights more visible to citizens of the Union. As to content, it felt the charter should contain the fundamental rights as well as basic <Col N="81" /> procedural rights guaranteed by the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, more commonly known as the European Convention on Human Rights, and the rights derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states as general principles of Community law. It was decided that the draft of such a charter should be established by a body comprised of representatives of Heads of State and Government.</P>
      <P>The major issues yet to be resolved are the nature of the charter &ndash; whether it will be a political declaration or a legally binding instrument for inclusion in the treaties; the scope of its application &ndash; whether in respect of the Union or in respect of some of its activities; who the beneficiaries should be &ndash; only EU citizens or also legal or illegal residents; consistency with existing human rights instruments, particularly the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Social Charter, and also International Labour Organisation conventions and the UN human rights instruments; and how the charter is to be enforced.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware the issue of racism has not been specifically raised, but it is undoubtedly the greatest challenge currently facing many EU states, including Ireland, and there are issues of international human rights compliance which are relevant and in respect of which we cannot deal with this issue in a purely domestic context. The human rights unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs is constantly making observations on Government proposals at all levels in the formulation of policy in relation to asylum and immigration. This matter involves international human rights compliance and not just domestic considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the Minister's reply that cultural rights were not mentioned. Perhaps she would like to address this issue. I have to ask this question of the Minister of State as we no longer have a Minister responsible for Culture, the title having been abolished rather vindictively.</P>
      <P>Given that there is no reference to cultural rights, will no notice be taken of the Council of Europe's document, <i>In from the Margins</i>, or of the UNESCO document, <i>Our Creative Diversity</i>, both of which make the case for cultural rights? This is related to the question asked by Deputy Mitchell. Does the Minister agree that if it becomes a political declaration rather than a legally binding document it will be just another hollow document to which nobody will pay attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point about the exclusion of cultural rights and I will raise it with the Taoiseach's representative in the process. There is nothing in my briefing to indicate any mention has been made of cultural rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear a decision has been made that it will be a political declaration. I agree with the <Col N="82" /> Deputy that much that is said about human rights is rhetorical and that more substance is necessary in terms of how we manifest our commitment to international human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that NGOs, for example, which deal with Third World development issues see the education of domestic public opinion on these issues as very important in terms of the support they need for their work. Similarly, does she agree that we need to educate the public in terms of counteracting racism and xenophobia and will she undertake to consider a programme of education in the Republic in relation to the dangers of racism and xenophobia?</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the ODA budget we have a subhead for development education. The NCDE, which is fully funded by the Government, disperses funding to development education projects, with over £1 million being provided this year. In the context of the ongoing debate on the need to counter racism in a very active way, the NCDE proposes having a public awareness campaign to contribute to the wider Government policy of public awareness to counter racism and xenophobia, which have been rearing their heads in Ireland. The efforts in the schools are extremely important and we will be co-operating with the INTO and the Department of Education and Science in terms of dealing with issues of development education, justice, and anti-racism programmes, particularly in primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is actively pursuing its human rights priorities in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and in conjunction with our EU partners. At the recent 56th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Ireland was the lead sponsor of two resolutions, one on the human rights of persons with disabilities and the other on religious intolerance. We were pleased that both resolutions were adopted by consensus and with an increased number of co-sponsors. We also co-sponsored many other resolutions reflecting our concerns internationally. These included resolutions on the death penalty, good governance and human rights defenders, as well as a number of country-specific resolutions, including, for instance, those on human rights in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and a resolution on the situation in Chechnya. We also fully supported a chairman's statement on East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At regional level, Ireland has just come to the end of its chairmanship of the Committee of <Col N="83" /> Ministers of the Council of Europe, an opportunity which was used to focus attention on the human rights role of that institution. With the appointment of a Human Rights Commissioner last year, the Council of Europe is playing an increasingly important role in the protection of human rights in Europe and is the guardian of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of the international community in international and regional fora such as those I have mentioned, there is a growing realisation among Governments and other international actors that the systems in place for the protection of vulnerable people in situations of conflict do not always provide an adequate level of protection. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments &ndash; the human rights and humanitarian law treaties which aim to provide protection for non-combatants &ndash; to the lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>However, Ireland will continue to fulfil its obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>
    <P>I also welcome this opportunity to announce that the third annual Department of Foreign Affairs-NGO forum on human rights will take place on Saturday, 1 July in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Mr. G. Mitchell: </b>I hope the Minister of State will make herself available to appear before the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights. We have sought a meeting with her for some time. If Governments are international actors, then this is a C rate film because not much progress is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State two questions in regard to the death penalty. Does she agree that some governors in the United States use the death penalty as a way of advancing their re-election prospects? Has the Government repeatedly raised the obscenity of this procedure and its continued use with the American authorities, particularly in regard to people who committed offences when they were young but who are not executed until much later? With regard to the death penalty in China, is she aware of evidence recently given to the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights which suggests that persons executed in China have their organs removed in advance and that it appears that they are sold at a market later? Has this matter been raised? If not, will she undertake to investigate and raise it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that he tabled a general question on human rights issues and his supplementary questions are specific in regard to allegations of human rights atroc<Col N="84" /> ities in China. I will reply to him separately on that matter. We co-sponsored a resolution on the death penalty at the 56th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. We have been consistently vocal in our opposition to the death penalty and have called for its abolition at many international fora.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland is prepared to overlook human rights abuses in China, particularly in Tibet, because of its increasing trade with that country? Is it not the case that trade will always take precedence over human rights as far as this Government is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the last meeting Ireland in conjunction with its EU partners decided not to co-sponsor the resolution on human rights in China. As expected the Chinese delegation called for a no action motion when the resolution came to be acted upon by the commission. As Ireland was not a member of the commission, Portugal, as President of the EU, voted against the motion on behalf of EU partners. All EU members of the commission also voted against this motion. In the end the no action motion was carried by 22 votes to 18 with 12 abstentions and the resolution could not proceed.</P>
      <P>I do not accept wholly that our human rights considerations are overtaken by economic and trade related concerns. We try through our foreign policy to vindicate and advocate compliance with international human rights. We have taken every opportunity to be vocal on human rights issues because Ireland is a neutral country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is applying the measures agreed by the Fourteen in respect of Austria as announced on 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency. Consistent with the terms of the Fourteen's measures, close contact with the Austrian authorities has continued and we have endeavoured to ensure that the fundamentals of our close relations with the Austrian authorities have continued. The new Austrian Government has been in office since 4 February. Mr. Jörg Haider has resigned as party leader of the Freedom Party and at its party conference on 1 May the Freedom Party committed itself to a statement reaffirming the common principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The question of the measures of the Fourteen was raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister in the course of an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in the Azores last weekend, which was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the debate that followed a number of speakers, including Ireland, saw a need to reflect on the situation with a view to its resolution. It is clear, however, that the issue remains a very sensitive one. The presence of a far right party in the Government is a matter of legitimate concern. Some partners, for understandable historical reasons, have taken a strong stand on this issue. No specific meetings between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Austrian ambassador are planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of a legal document in circulation which was reported on in the<i> Bar Review</i> recently, which indicates clearly that the action taken against Austria was illegal and a totally improper precedent to set because the proper treaty provisions were not used? When does she anticipate that this illegal action will be brought to a conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that document <Col N="87" /> but we do not accept that illegal action was taken by the Union. The measures announced by the Portuguese Presidency on 31 January were agreed after full consultation with partners at prime ministerial level. The reaction of the 14 member states was measured which reflected the strong commitment to fundamental values and norms which underpin the social and political fabric of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was among those who attended a recent informal meeting of Foreign Ministers who called for partners to reflect on the situation with a view to working towards a resolution. We must, however, understand the views of other partners which, for historical reasons, have taken a particularly ideological and strong stand on this issue. The Minister has said it is time for all concerned to reflect on the situation while not taking any hasty or ill-judged measures. The measures were agreed by the 14 member states and it would be best if the matter could be resolved in a collective manner, agreeable to all. The measures agreed were a reaction based on the fundamental principles of the EU and that is undeniable. The presence of a far right party in the Austrian Government is a matter of legitimate concern. Ireland at all times will act in its best interests as an EU partner which values it relations with other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that Austria is also a partner and that it has been treated in a wholly unacceptable manner? On numerous occasions I have condemned the views of Mr. Haider and his associates. Does she agree that a precedent has been established whereby Ireland has been frog-marched into this situation by those with particular interests to advance on their domestic agendas?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that at some future date, God forbid, Deputy P. O'Neill might be about to become Minister for Defence and, at the instigation of a foreign Government, the European Union might decide to take a stance which it has no right to take? The EU has illegally bypassed a number of its own institutions in this case. Does she further agree that officials in other European Union states are receiving the ambassadors of Austria while officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs are refusing to do so, an action which goes well beyond what is required under the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the Government's view that the action taken by the fourteen was balanced. The relevant political personalities in Austria were aware of the attitude of partners before the measures of 31 January were adopted. These measures came into effect on 4 February when the new Austrian Government, including the Freedom Party, entered office and were not intended to and do not have any effect in law. As stated earlier, a number of decisions were <Col N="88" /> reached last weekend when Foreign Ministers met in informal session to reflect on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of reflecting on the matter was brought to my attention today and it was only decided upon at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers at the weekend. Some concerns have been expressed at the open-ended nature of the arrangements which were agreed by the fourteen and certain countries, including Ireland, are willing to consider the practical implications of the measures which were announced. That is the current situation and we will continue to report new developments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12, 20, 42, 55, 64 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>European security and defence policy is the subject of ongoing and active discussion within the EU. As Deputies will be aware, these discussions focus on the Petersberg Tasks and not on mutual defence commitments. The basis of these discussions is the Treaty of Amsterdam. This work has two aspects, namely, the military dimension, embodied in the Petersberg Tasks and the related civil aspects of crisis management, for example, disaster relief and humanitarian support.</P>
      <P>At Helsinki last December, the European Council called for the creation of new Brussels based bodies and structures to enhance the EU's ability to take informed and effective decisions in the area of the Petersberg Tasks, and to assist in taking forward the EU discussions on these points. These bodies have been established on an interim basis and are starting to function effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal such body is the interim political <Col N="90" /> and security committee. Ireland is represented on that committee by a senior official from my Department. An interim military body, which has been established to provide military advice as required for the political and security committee, is also meeting. Ireland is represented by a military officer with the rank of colonel who works under the guidance of my Department in close consultation with the Department of Defence. Following the establishment of these interim bodies, the EU is better placed to discuss issues relating to the Petersberg Tasks and to take informed and effective decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council also agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a &ldquo;headline goal&rdquo;, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, is to be able to deploy between 50,000 and 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission on a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>As the Helsinki conclusions make clear, we are not concerned with the creation of a European army. Participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case. The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers, was mandated at Helsinki to take forward the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which it could be met and progress reviewed. Member states will also use existing defence planning procedures which, in the case of Ireland and the other neutral and non-allied EU member states, would include the planning and review process of Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>The EU will require access to NATO's transport and infrastructural resources and assets for carrying out substantial Petersberg Tasks and this requires consultation and co-operation with NATO. All EU member states are already co-operating with NATO both in the context of participation in the UN-mandated, NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and in the context of PfP. The UN and the OSCE have well established co-operation with NATO. In keeping with its mandate from the Helsinki European Council, the Presidency has chaired EU discussions regarding the principles and modalities for EU relations with NATO in this context. The question of mutual defence commitments does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council agreed to define appropriate arrangements that would allow interested non-EU states to contribute to the Petersberg Tasks. A draft Presidency paper on this issue has also been circulated. The recent Lisbon European Council considered a preliminary progress report by the Presidency on the follow-up to last December's Helsinki European Council conclusions. A more substantial progress <Col N="91" /> report will be considered by the Feira European Council in June.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made in regard to the civil aspects of crisis management. In line with the recent Lisbon European Council conclusions, an EU Committee for Civilian Crisis Management is to be established in the near future. It is hoped that the Feira European Council will be able to agree on concrete targets which the EU would aim to meet in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that not everyone in the House would agree with my views on European security and defence which I set out in my party's policy document, Beyond Neutrality. However, that is what this Parliament is about, namely, the accommodation of people with different views. When does the Government intend to put forward its view on this matter?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the appointment of Javier Solana, former Secretary General of NATO, as Secretary General of the Council of Ministers, with special responsibility for common foreign and security policy, and Secretary General of the Western European Union is a clear indication of the direction in which European defence and security policy is moving? Does she further agree that the reason a European army is not being contemplated is because it has already been created and that an army numbering 240,000 soldiers would be required in order to put a force of 60,000 into the field and provide the necessary logistical support? Is it correct to anticipate that France, which assumes the Presidency of the European Union in the latter part of this year, is likely to attempt to advance these matters further? When can we expect the parties in Government to put before the House their position on European security and defence? Will they be led by the nose, as usual, by another government which will decide the pace and we will fall in line just as we did over the action taken against Austria?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, we are not talking about the creation of a European army. Participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case. The EU is not considering issues of mutual defence, rather its focus is on making a constructive reality of the Amsterdam Treaty's provisions on the Petersberg Tasks. The Government has made it clear that if the issue of common defence, which would involve a mutual defence commitment by Ireland, were to arise for decision in future, it would be put to the people by way of referendum. However, the reality is that the EU's focus is not on common defence, but on the Petersberg Tasks.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on EU legislation: Transport  &ndash; Proposals for Directives on Railway Infrastructure and on Combined Transport.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to continue the process of debating in the House the reports my committee has produced over the past two years. The current committee was established in December 1997 and over the past two and a half years it has produced a series of reports inspired by the various legislative proposals of the European Union. The joint committee has examined the impact and import of these reports on the quality of life in this country. The joint committee has also examined in considerable detail several transport proposals last year. In particular, the joint committee examined detailed proposals concerning combined transport and changes in vehicle weights, as well as proposals relating to railway infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed changes, the structure of which has been agreed, it may be possible for various entities to share in the various aspects and modes of transport available in Ireland. That means that at a future stage an investor could become involved in rail and other transport. In order to get a better grasp of the likely impact of the proposals, the joint committee met a series of groups in order to examine our current transport infrastructure and how it is likely to be affected by the proposed EU directives. In that regard we met representatives from the Dublin Port authority, the Road Haulage Association, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Department of Public Enterprise's transport section, and a number of others who addressed the joint committee.</P>
      <P>Some extraordinary things transpired. The Department of Public Enterprise did not seem to be as conscious or concerned as we were about the possible impact on transport here of the involvement of other bodies and agencies in the transport network. This will emerge to a greater extent in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The joint committee also examined the Dublin Port and Docks Board. We discovered that a huge volume of transport is generated by the port, which is a welcome development. Traffic to and from the country's main port is an indication of the state of the economy. It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the growth of that volume of transport in recent years. For example, in 1990 the number of roll-on/roll-off units using Dublin Port amounted to 102,000. In 1991 the figure had risen to 123,000, but by 1998 the total had risen to 399,000. Those units all had to go through the main streets of the capital to gain access to the port. It is imperative to find alternative means of channelling such transport volumes away from sensitive urban areas. This matter is currently being examined in other European cities.</P>
    <P>There has been a fourfold increase in freight traffic in Dublin Port in the past ten years. In 1990, 142,000 load-on/load-off units were using Dublin Port, but by 1998 the figure had risen to 356,000 such units. The number of passengers travelling through Dublin Port in 1990 was 630,000, while by 1998 the figure had reached 1.28 million. The number of tourist cars has increased dramatically from 115,000 in 1990 to 237,000 in 1998. All these figures provide an indication of the way in which traffic volumes have increased in recent years. Consequently, in all major European cities an examination is being undertaken to ascertain how best to enable traffic to move more easily to and from ports.</P>
    <P>EU transport directives will also affect deliveries in various EU cities. We will have to decide whether such deliveries occur in the middle of the working day or at night. In order to alleviate traffic problems, most other EU member states are taking seriously the need to make deliveries at night or during other off-peak times. In this way, unnecessary traffic jams can be eliminated. The Road Haulage Association indicated that it could reduce costs to the consumer by a considerable margin if its members could operate in off-peak periods. Coincidentally, the Dublin Port and Docks Board is willing to consider such options but, to the best of my knowledge, little progress has been made up to now.</P>
    <P>In commending this motion to the House, I would point out that forthcoming EU transport directives will affect the manner and methodology of handling our road traffic. It would be useful for us now to take whatever steps are necessary to put in place a structure whereby we can at least alleviate the worst aspects of the traffic congestion that affects us at present by taking on board those simple tips our European colleagues are already putting into operation. We will, in any event, have to put them into operation in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan and the other committee members for their detailed consideration of the proposed EU legis<Col N="95" /> lation in relation to the railways and combined transport.</P>
      <P>Transport has in recent years assumed an enormous significance across the EU member states. In Ireland, as in the other states, we are in the process of urgently addressing the problems that are clearly evident to everyone. In particular, we must ease the chronic traffic congestion that afflicts all our major cities and towns and is spreading to many smaller towns and villages. The reason for this congestion is the over-reliance on road transport by both commuters and businesses due a perceived lack of acceptable alternatives. The Government is seeking to put in place those acceptable alternatives.</P>
      <P>In this context, the vital role of the railways in our transport policy has now been recognised and programmes are in place to address the deficiencies which exist. The national development plan provides for unprecedented levels of investment in transport infrastructure. For the rail sector this will, on the one hand, improve the safety of the rail network and, on the other hand, increase its reach and capacity.</P>
      <P>At EU level, it is accepted that a renewed railway sector is vital for the future of Europe's transport system and current EU policy is designed to reverse the railways' long-term decline in market share, particularly in relation to freight. The proposed directives we are discussing today are part of a broader package of proposals for the rail sector. Other issues currently under discussion relate to interoperability of conventional rail systems and safety regulation and standards of the European railways.</P>
      <P>The proposed directives which were addressed by the committee are first, three draft directives which form part of what is termed the &ldquo;railway package&rdquo; and comprise directives amending Directive 91/440/EC and Directive 95/18/EC, and a new directive, replacing Directive 95/19/EC, on establishing the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of the railway infrastructure and safety certification and, second, the committee considered a proposed directive on combined transport which was to amend Directives 92/106/EEC and 96/53/EC. The latter proposal was designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to increase the use of combined transport as an alternative to road transport, and also to bring down the minimum distance in which combined transport is competitive.</P>
      <P>The combined transport directive was discussed at a Transport Council meeting in March 1999. A number of the provisions of the draft directive were problematic for some member states, including Ireland, and, unfortunately, agreement could not be reached. The proposed directive has not been raised at the Council since. In relation to the &ldquo;railway package&rdquo;, substantial progress has been made on the draft directives and these are expected to be adopted during this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current proposals have their origins in <Col N="96" /> Directive 91/440/EEC. This directive is regarded as the first step in the revitalisation of the European railways. It opened up access to European railways for international services, where such services were provided by a grouping of at least two railway companies, and enabled access for individual railway companies providing international combined transport freight services. The directive also provided that the management of the railways be independent of the state and included provisions to allow greater commercial freedom and the separation of accounts for infrastructure from rail transport operations.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of this directive were at that time already enshrined in Irish law, for example, the statutory independence and commercial nature of larnród Éireann. The only obligation on Ireland arising from the directive was that concerning access rights, and this obligation was met by Statutory Instrument No. 204 of 1996, which allows suitably qualified operators to exercise the right of access to the Irish rail network for international transport operations.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to Directive 91/440/EEC, two further complementary directives were adopted in 1995. Directive 95/18/EC sets down rules for licensing rail operators and Directive 95/19/EC provides for the allocation of infrastructure capacity and the charging of infrastructure fees. Both directives were transposed into Irish law in 1999.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these initiatives, the railways have continued to lose market share to road transport and it was recognised that the broad frameworks created by these directives needed to be expanded in order to make liberalisation practical and thereby improve the competitive position of the railways.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the current proposals are twofold &ndash; first, to ensure that all railway undertakings are treated in a fair and equitable manner and, second, to provide for the efficient and competitive use of infrastructure. It may be useful to summarise the provisions of these three draft directives and to outline Ireland's position on them and the likely impact they will have on the Irish rail sector.</P>
    <P>The draft directive amending Directive 91/440/EEC provides for a more extensive compulsory separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the provider of the transport services. Licensed undertakings will be entitled to access for the purposes of operating international freight services to what is termed the trans-European rail freight network. This is an extensive network of railway lines in all member states, and on the island of Ireland comprises the rail line from Derry through Belfast and Dublin to Cork.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of administrative changes. The most significant from an Irish perspective is the requirement to ensure that the functions of determining equitable and non-discriminatory access to the infrastructure and of levying charges for the use of such infrastructure <Col N="97" /> are entrusted to bodies independent from the rail undertakings. Ireland has sought and received a derogation from this requirement of establishing separate bodies.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the draft directive amending Directive 95/18/EC is to extend the licensing system to all rail undertakings in the Community rather than limiting it to those which provide international services as is currently the case. The draft directive to replace Directive 95/19/EC is a more extensive piece of legislation with a large volume of regulatory detail. Its main purpose is to oblige member states to treat applicants for access to railway infrastructure in a non-discriminatory manner by establishing procedures and charging systems for access to, and use of, infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The question arises, therefore, as to what impact these directives will have on the rail sector in Ireland. Deputies will be aware that the Irish rail network is in many respects unique within the EU. A number of factors must be taken into account by Ireland in considering and developing proposals at EU level. In particular, the fact that the rail network on the island of Ireland is isolated from the rest of the Community, the unique gauge of our rail network, the low population base and the uneconomic nature of train services are significant barriers to the development of real competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main concern, therefore, in the discussions on the development of these proposals was to ensure that any directives adopted would not impose significant bureaucratic costs, with little or no associated benefits. The uniqueness of the Irish position is acknowledged by counterparts in the other member states. The Council has agreed with the Minister on the need for derogations for Ireland, Northern Ireland and Greece to the more onerous administrative requirements in the draft directives. These derogations relate to the establishment of an independent body for allocating access to infrastructure and determining infrastructure charges, and also for dealing with appeals in relation to these matters. The derogations also cover a range of related measures in the proposed directive.</P>
    <P>These derogations are not without conditions and are for a five year period but can be renewed. More importantly, they are conditional on no railway undertaking from outside the island of Ireland applying to operate competing services and no railway undertaking operating in Ireland applying to operate services in another member state.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has sought these derogations should not be viewed in any way as an attempt to hinder the possible advent of competition in the rail sector. Rather it is an indication of the reality of the unique characteristics of the sector in Ireland. The Minister's record on introducing competition in other sectors is well known and it is something which she is also considering in the rail sector.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Minister has put forward a <Col N="98" /> number of proposals to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure setting out options for the future of the public transport sector. These proposals are wide-ranging and include a number of measures impacting on the rail sector, in particular, the establishment of an independent public transport regulatory body; possible separation of Iarnród Éireann into two independent companies &ndash; one responsible for the infrastructure and the other for the operation of train services and in the longer term, the possible transfer of the rail operating company to the private sector or of franchising the operation of some or all railway services.</P>
    <P>These proposals are currently under consideration. Depending on the outcome of these deliberations, the requirements for the derogation provisions in the draft directives will need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I again thank the House for the opportunity to discuss these matters today. It is recognised by the Government that the rail sector has a vital role to play in the development of a sustainable transport policy. It is an exciting time for the rail industry. For the first time in many years its future is assured and the necessary finance is available to enhance the quality and quantity of the services it offers. The main concern is to ensure that the necessary framework is in place to enable it to reach its full potential, and the nature of this framework, both at national and EU level, is an issue which is now being addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the chairman of the committee, Deputy Durkan, and his staff on producing another report, which is before the House today. I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, although it has to be said that the subject matter, Proposals for Directives on Railway Infrastructure and on Combined Transport, has limited application to this country, largely because we rely to such an extent on one form of transport for both passenger and freight, that is, road transport.</P>
      <P>It is at times like this that we really regret the way in which our rail network was largely dismantled and limited to a handful of mainline routes. The rail system is an efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport. At a time when the road system is in danger of choking to death the principal regret is that we do not have a more substantial rail system. Some 40 years after Dr. Todd Andrews cut a swathe of destruction through our rail network, we can all now acknowledge how short-sighted that policy was. It is ironic that 40 years after the last train ran on the Harcourt Street-Bray rail line, CIE is at the moment surveying the line, preparing to rebuild bridges that were demolished and reclaiming the permanent way to facilitate the Luas project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Harcourt Street-Bray line not been chopped prematurely in the 1950s, it could have been providing the same efficient DART service as the coastal line, saving huge traffic congestion in much of the southern suburbs. The potential of rail to reduce traffic flows through Dublin has not been fully exploited. One does not have to be a <Col N="99" /> traffic engineer to recognise that a huge element of the now almost permanent traffic congestion in Dublin city arises from the huge volume of container lorries travelling to and from the port. Astonishingly, only 10% of imports and exports through Dublin Port transfer to or from rail and most of this is made up of ore and oil. Only a small proportion &ndash; some 4% to 6% &ndash; is container traffic. Given that there is an existing rail network from the port to the outer suburbs, why has no serious effort been made to get this container traffic off the streets and on the rail line?</P>
    <P>The time has long gone since traffic problems were confined to Dublin. Many towns and villages, especially along primary routes are being choked to death. Anyone who has travelled through Kildare town in my constituency, for instance, will know what I mean. As with the problem of the cities, much of the traffic congestion is caused by freight transport on huge juggernauts that cause enormous environmental damage. Again the question that must be asked is, why is more of this freight not moved by rail.</P>
    <P>The rail system is also an enormously expensive operation and it eats up the vast bulk of the £100 million plus subsidy CIE receives from the Exchequer. Despite the cost, money spent on the rail system is money well spent. The railways cause little environmental damage or pollution and they are a lifeline to many communities along the lines. It should also be emphasised that despite the very worrying findings of some recent reports, the railway has been a generally safe mode of transport with a safety record as good or better than any of the alternative means of transport available.</P>
    <P>Given all these factors, it is very disappointing that the national development plan did not contain any proposals for new rail lines and restricted itself to proposals to simply upgrade existing lines. We need to upgrade mainline routes. The Labour Party would like to see the principal mainline routes, like Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Belfast and Dublin-Galway, not just upgraded, but also electrified. We should look for potential new routes. In the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and a new chapter in North-South co-operation, there is real potential for a new rail line linking Dublin and Derry. This would not only provide a vital link with Derry but would provide a significant boost for many towns and counties along the route, which currently do not have a rail connection.</P>
    <P>However, even allowing for the underdeveloped state of our railway system, the directive is worth supporting. Any steps that can lead to a more efficient use of and better integration between the various transport options are worth supporting. We must, however, ensure that in the rush to create more efficiency, we do not sacrifice safety standards. Part of the directive proposes the removal of restrictions operating in some countries, but not in Ireland, on night time and weekend driving. Rather than seeking to have these restrictions lifted, should we not seek to have these higher standards implemented in all member states, including Ireland?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> In addition, the proposal to increase the weight limit for freight vehicles by four tonnes will have implications for Ireland. Forty-two tonne, five axle articulated vehicles may be fine on six lane autobahns in Germany, but they are an entirely different proposition on Ireland's main routes, many of which still pass through small towns and villages and in which bridges were built in the last century. One wonders what impact this new development will have on that. Has the Department carried out an assessment of the environmental implications of such an increase in the weight limit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I compliment the chairman on bringing forward, with the committee, the third in a series of reports which, in their own way, are interesting to debate in this House. I pay tribute to the clerk of the committee and his staff on the diligent and efficient way in which they compile these reports on our behalf. Members of the committee will be aware that on a fortnightly or monthly basis, we get a raft of directives from the EU. I pay tribute to the consultants who have been working on behalf of the committee for several years. Some of the directives are obscure, perhaps those about which we are talking today, and had the consultant not suggested these might merit further discussion and had the chairman not agreed to that, discussion might not have taken place on these directives.</P>
      <P>We had a wide range of submissions, written and oral, from Departments and, significantly, from bodies like the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Dublin Port authority and the Irish Road Hauliers Association. It is probably a mark of where we are in terms of rail transport that all the submissions from the private sector suggested the proposed directives had very little relevance to the Irish situation. Our colleague, Deputy McGuinness, put his finger on it during the course of the discussion after the road hauliers made their presentation when he suggested that the railway infrastructure is very much akin to what the telephone was not so long ago. We have all seen what grabbing that issue by the neck and investing significantly in it have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the significant resources which will be invested by the Government in the rail sector through the national development plan. It is hoped that when the development plan is realised, we will have a railway infrastructure like those of our European partners. Deputy Durkan mentioned the volume of traffic spoken of by the Dublin Port Company. The contributions of the company and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce were <i>ad idem. </i>Both bodies and the members of the committee were concerned at the large volumes of heavy traffic which trundle into Dublin on a daily basis. We talked about the city quays being clogged by traffic, much of it heavy traffic, from morning to night and about the issues which this raised for the viability of the port. There was a lively debate on what could be done by the Dublin Port Company to contribute to easing the traffic problem. The company stressed the need to improve our capacity to deliver infrastructural projects and it was supported in this by the <Col N="101" /> chamber of commerce. There is concern at the delay in furthering the port tunnel project. The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance when the order for the port tunnel was originally signed and very little progress has been made since then. Until we start digging, many people will be sceptical about the future of the project.</P>
    <P>The chamber of commerce also talked about the perennial problem of deliveries to commercial and retail premises in the city. The chamber can play its part in solving this problem. Companies such as Arnotts and Marks and Spencer are playing their part in trying to have overnight deliveries but I particularly criticise brewing companies for their capacities to clog up streets, and almost invariably street corners, from 10.30 a.m. until lunch time. I cannot understand why some directive cannot be issued to have those deliveries made earlier in the day. We have heard arguments regarding additional costs to the licensed trade but licensed vintners appeared to have no difficulty in putting 5p on the pint, without notice to their customers, to meet additional costs. Surely some way could be found to meet the cost of having deliveries made earlier. Dublin Corporation and its staff have also played their part, and many refuse collections are now done during the night.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the port company reiterated their desires to see the eastern port relief route developed as soon as possible. Once the port tunnel is operational the eastern port relief route should, logically, be provided. This relief route would have a great deal to offer.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure is doing much in examining traffic in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country. It is no longer only the city and suburbs of Dublin which are clogged with traffic. Members of the committee who live in Drogheda, Kilkenny and elsewhere throughout the country were critical of the difficulties which commercial bodies such as hauliers have in having loads transported efficiently and on time to adjacent ports. There is a future for improving the railway infrastructure. I hope we will soon be in a position to have, for example, the rail line from Dublin to Navan investigated further. I note that Iarnród Éireann is considering the possibility of a heavy rail line from Cabra to Dublin Airport. This will facilitate the move to rail transport.</P>
    <P>The question of the east-west corridor and the need for efficient links between Ireland and the United Kingdom was also discussed. Under the INTERREG programme, a considerable study was done of the need for this corridor to be made more efficient, more streamlined and more attractive. If we are to move from current models of transport to more efficient, more environmentally friendly and more cost effective ones we will need to promote initiatives such as this.</P>
    <P>The submissions from the road haulage interest and the chamber of commerce spoke very much of on-time deliveries and the difficulties posed in this regard by the lack of a good road network. This matter is also being tackled in the national development plan. While the report is not a pana<Col N="102" /> cea for all our ills, the submissions made to the committee provide valuable food for thought. It is not often possible to bring significant interests together in one arena to explore ways of improving matters such as transport infrastructure. These proposed directives, like many which come before the committee, do not appear to have any immediate application. However, the representative of the road hauliers association suggested that directives such as these can be issued, almost by sleight of hand so that there is a need to be constantly watchful. Fortunately, we have the watchdog of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to what Deputy Carey had to say and I shall respond to a number of the points he made. Deputy Carey makes the point that if the port tunnel is built, the so-called eastern bypass should go ahead. The Green Party has constantly made this point. We said the tunnel was a Trojan horse for the eastern bypass. The questions Deputy Carey and others must ask are whether this will alleviate the traffic in congested areas such as Sandymount and what modelling has been done on this important question. This project is not a panacea for congestion. All the evidence shows that when roads are built more traffic is attracted onto them.</P>
      <P>The EU is attempting to look at this problem very comprehensively and the answer which emerges constantly is that rail transport is the way forward. Commissioner Neil Kinnock, for example, has tried to do tremendous work in this area. Emissions of CO2 are rising dramatically, with 60% of them coming from cars. If we are to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, we will have to invest more heavily in rail. Under the Kyoto Protocol, we are entitled to increase our CO2 emissions by 13% over the 1990 level. That is a huge increase. If we do not reduce our emissions we cannot afford this huge increase.</P>
      <P>During the Glen of the Downs controversy we saw vigil-keepers, or eco-warriors, being jailed. This was a very good example of our failure to understand the transport problem. That road was built in 1970. Thirty years on it has had to be widened and there is no question that it will have to be widened further, probably in 15 years because of exponential growth in traffic volumes. As a result it takes commuters 40 seconds less to reach Dublin but as car numbers increase they will not reach the city as quickly. Given that cars in Dublin move at the same pace as the old horse and cart, it is increasingly a myth that the car offers mobility, so much so that in countries such as Japan it is not worth while buying one. Investment in the rail network therefore is of huge importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case that Todd Andrews wreaked havoc with the rail network. When it was proposed that a number of railway lines be closed in County Kerry a delegation travelled to Dublin to see him. The first question he asked was, &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;  When the delegation replied, &ldquo;By car&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;That is the end of the meeting&rdquo;. That anecdote is often told. While the day of simplistic solutions is gone, there are those <Col N="103" /> who still believe that road is best and ignore the advantages of the rail network. A bulletin published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government states that the way towards sustainability is by improving the eco-efficiency of our roads. If there was ever a contradiction that is it. That is pure bunkum. We cannot talk about sustainability if we are not prepared to talk about investment in the rail network.</P>
    <P>There have been successes. It takes the Enterprise service about 25 minutes to travel from Drogheda to Dublin. It is packed every single day. This proves that if a service is provided it will be used. The same applies to the DART, along the route of which house prices have increased. I doubt if the same can be said about houses built adjacent to certain roads. There is a view that one buys a house outside the city adjacent to a main road and commutes but, like Dublin, these roads will soon become congested. On bank holiday weekends one simply cannot move on the roads.</P>
    <P>Huge investment in the rail network is required in excess of what is provided for in the national development plan. Despite the great promises made by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, sufficient funds are not being invested. There is an imbalance. Almost four times as much will be invested in the road network. There is therefore a need to reassess our priorities.</P>
    <P>The Green Party recognises the need for port access. To this end we suggest that access be gained by the Liffey tunnel. It is clear however that the only route this can take is across Sandymount strand. Will it be a cut and cover or bore tunnel? I find it difficult to believe that one would go to the expense of boring a tunnel for a distance of two miles. I do not know whether this is possible in engineering terms but of most importance to my constituents is whether it will alleviate the traffic problems in the area. There is no evidence that it will. In all likelihood it will be a public-private partnership project, which means the imposition of a toll which members of the public do not like paying, which means, in turn, that they will continue to take short cuts. My constituents were informed that the East Link Bridge would alleviate the traffic problems in the area but it has not worked out that way. The problems in Ringsend and Irishtown are worse than ever. If one looks at the air pollution monitoring results, in particular the levels of PM 10 which damages people's health, one will find that Ringsend and Irishtown are black spots. One in four children in the area suffer from asthma. This is appalling.</P>
    <P>The idea that the construction of new roads is the panacea to our transport ills is complete bunkum. There is a need to invest in the rail network. We are repeating the mistakes made by other countries many years ago rather than learning from their experience. With an increase in the number of Greens elected at the next election I hope the agenda will change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate on what is always an <Col N="104" /> interesting subject. I thank the members of the joint committee for their support and contributions in compiling the report. I thank those who gave evidence, the clerk, Micheál Ó Corcora, and the committee secretariat. Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Corporation were among those which made submissions.</P>
      <P>On the question of European directives on transport, European institutions are looking at alternatives in attempting to determine how existing resources can best be managed. While I appreciate the points made by Deputy Gormley in respect of investment in railway infrastructure, given the size of the country, investment in passenger transport presents itself more readily than investment in goods transport. From the point of view of the efficient use of resources it is therefore much more effective to invest in passenger transport.</P>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with what the Deputy said about the road network in which we have not invested to the same degree as other European countries. Those countries which invested heavily in road infrastructure 40 to 50 years ago have reaped the benefit. They have also invested in railway infrastructure. As a result they are able to transport both passengers and goods in large volumes over short and long distances in a very efficient manner. The same cannot be said about Dublin where, in trying to access the city from any angle on any morning of the week, one has to compete with a series of factors, which include the number of cars on the road.</P>
      <P>By a long shot this is not the biggest capital city in the world. I cannot understand why we cannot get our heads together to try to alleviate some of the problems. Road hauliers were very quick to point out before the joint committee that they could reduce their costs to consumers by up to 15% if they were allowed to transport goods to the port unimpeded at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. and conclude their business by 6.30 a.m. They also said they could considerably reduce their costs to the commercial sector throughout the city if they were allowed to access routes at an earlier or later hour, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The competitors one has to meet are those referred to by Deputy Pat Carey and those to which I referred in the context of heavy goods vehicles. These people do not want to be in the city at that time because they are wasting time and money. The simple and realistic solution is to open the port earlier. This will not solve the problem but it will not do any harm either. We called for an experiment in this regard lasting a fortnight, three weeks, a month or whatever because practical tests are the best option. I take on board the points raised by Deputies but the EU is looking at traffic movement and trying to find ways and means of improving efficiency. The greater the efficiencies the better economies will function, producing benefits for all.</P>

    <P>The work undertaken by the committee over the past two years, involving a number of other reports which will be discussed and laid before the House in the not too distant future, was tedious, difficult, time consuming and important. I pay tribute to my colleagues on the committee <Col N="105" /> and all associated with it, including witnesses who freely and readily gave of their time, energy and expertise in an effort to participate in the parliamentary process and to contribute towards improving society.</P>
    <P>This process has been ongoing month after month, often to the exclusion of competing demands and urgent business to which Members have to attend. I thank them for their work.</P>
    <P>During the compilation of this report, the committee discussed the options which might be brought forward to alleviate the problem. For example, there was an unfortunate fire on the quays this morning and the whole city came to a halt.</P>

      <P>Traffic cannot get through when a road is blocked. Obviously traffic from other directions can get through but it was a very difficult morning for traffic trying to access the city from a particular direction. The port and transport authorities are willing to co-operate and they should work with the corporation, traders and anyone else involved and recognise that the EU is working on directives with which we will have to comply and try to rationalise the situation and alleviate the chaos facing us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A bus company which provides services in rural areas approached me about a difficulty it has with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This company is part of a very reputable group which provides rural and inter-urban services not provided by Bus Éireann and is the only supplier of public transport in many areas.</P>
      <P>The company operates a number of licensed routes, including three in County Kildare &ndash; one between Clane, Sallins and Naas, a Naas town service, Kilcullen to Newbridge and Roscrea to Limerick. Because these are licensed services the company is empowered to operate the free travel scheme on the same basis as Bus Éireann &ndash; it makes a claim on the Department for the cost of providing free transport. On these routes, and in many other parts of the country, people would not have effective access to free travel without the services of this and similar companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, in discussions with the Department, the company quoted a figure for this service but the Department demurred. In response, the company offered and implemented a 10% discount on the original level of charges quoted. The company submitted its invoices and the Department paid out the money. However, last month the <Col N="106" /> Department informed the bus company that instead of looking for a discount of 10% it was now looking for a discount of 40%. As far as I can find out, no rationale, justification or reason was given for this development. The Department simply stated that it wished to reduce the price and asked the company to adjust its invoices accordingly.</P>
    <P>The tone of the Department's communication was on a take it or leave it basis. If the company did not like the reduction the Department stated, &ldquo;Otherwise you may wish to consider your participation in the free travel scheme for the above routes&rdquo;. In other words, the Department decided it was going to reduce the price paid to the company and, if the company did not like the figure, its participation in the scheme would be over. This is a fairly crude way of doing business. It is bad enough to treat a company in this manner but it is worse when one considers the effects on that company's passengers.</P>
    <P>The company has four not inconsiderable routes regarding which, unless something happens, the Department is saying there will no longer be a free travel service for people entitled to that service. This is not a proper way to go about this business and it is no way to treat this company.</P>
    <P>In addition, although this is not the burden of my remarks, the company has been told that it must change to using low sulphur fuel which is not readily available from fuel importers. However, surprise surprise, Bus Éireann has its own arrangements for importing low sulphur fuel for use in its buses. I am not normally of a nasty, mean or suspicious turn of mind, but that is no coincidence. The Department is operating a very arbitrary approach to pricing accompanied by another arbitrary approach to the use of low sulphur fuel which, surprise surprise, might have the effect of making competition more difficult for those competing with Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should direct the Department to reopen discussions with this company on a more reasonable basis. For all I know, this could be happening to other companies and other people's free travel could be in danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has responsibility for the operation of the free travel scheme which enables elderly people generally, and other eligible disabled clients, to travel free of charge on public transport services provided by participating transport operators throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, there are 76 private operators in the scheme in addition to the CIE group. The operators are recompensed by the Department, normally on a monthly basis, for the free travel passengers they carry. In the case of new private operator participants, initially the level of recompense is determined by monitoring the numbers of free travel passengers carried on the relevant services over a period, and payment is based, in effect, on fares lost as a result. The <Col N="107" /> Department normally negotiates a discount in payment to reflect the additional revenue that the scheme generates for participating operators, utilising spare seating capacity at comparatively lower marginal cost for the operators concerned.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, the Department is moving to fixed contracts with participating transport operators. Where passenger volume trends are comparatively stable, as they are with most operator services, then such fixed contract payment arrangements give cash-flow certainty to the operators and allow for improved budget management by the Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of the private operator referred to by Deputy Dukes, the company concerned is one of a related group of three participating operator companies in the south east. The group of companies received £246,000 in aggregate from the Department in 1999 for the free travel services they provided on 15 approved routes. In 1999, the group management sought increases in payment rates from the Department, reflecting both increased operating costs and expansion of free travel services.</P>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations on this application, the Department offered a fixed contract in respect of each of the three companies concerned. The net effect of the fixed contracts offered was to raise payment rates to the operator by over £20,000 per year from 2000 to 2002, inclusive. The aggregate payment offered to the group over this period would amount to over £800,000, about £60,000 or 8% more than payment to the group would have been had it remained at 1999 rates.</P>
    <P>The Department considered this a reasonable offer taking account of all the circumstances. This has largely been accepted by the operator group management concerned as it has agreed to the components of the Department's offer relating to two of the three companies involved. In the case of the third company, operating comparatively new routes, the management accepted the payment rates offered by the Department for Waterford city services but claimed that the fixed payment rates offered on the other specific routes referred to by Deputy Dukes did not adequately reflect the ongoing growth in take-up by free travel passengers. The Department responded to this by offering to review payment on those routes after a further six months, that is, at the end of June 2000. While no commitment was made by the Department to adjust payment rates on those routes after that further period, it would be prepared to do so if the company's monthly returns in this interim period so justified.</P>
    <P>The returns submitted subsequently by the company concerned have shown increased free travel passenger volumes on these routes. Subject to normal verification procedures, the Department is prepared to adjust payment on these routes to reflect the average volumes carried in the period to end June 2000 and to fix them at that rate for the remainder of the contract period. The Department will be in contact directly with the company management concerned in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The Department refutes the proposition that the payment to this group of companies was cut in any way. The opposite is the case as there is a significant aggregate increase in payments being made to the operator companies concerned. The services provided on these routes are well run and have operated satisfactorily as far as the Department and its clients are concerned and the Department has no wish to jeopardise this service to its clients in the south east. In general, however, there is an onus on the Department to pay realistic amounts to operators for the services they provide, as in this case, but payments under the scheme are not a subsidy to operators.</P>
    <P>The viability of particular routes is a matter for the operators. All participating operators in the free travel scheme carry fare paying passengers as well and have scope to increase the fares charged to fare paying passengers if the payment rates provided by the Department do not, in the operators' view, fully cover increases in running costs. It is also relevant to note that the State effectively provides a subsidy for public transport operators, including the companies concerned, through the fuel duty rebate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Department will be in touch again with the company management concerned and urges it to accept what is a realistic and significant aggregate increase in payment for the range of services it provides for free travel clients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent days and weeks we have witnessed a scramble by the establishment parties to introduce legislation which will restore public confidence in the political process. The Green Party was the first political party to call for a ban on corporate donations to political parties. This idea, however, was contemptuously dismissed by other parties until a few weeks ago when there was a sudden conversion to our view. I welcome that conversion. However, without the Dunlop revelations it would not have come about.</P>
      <P>It is opportune, in light of the revelations, to look at what people had to say at the time. My colleague, Deputy Sargent, was sent a £100 cheque which he waved in front of the other county councillors in the chamber of Dublin County Council, asking if any of them had received a similar cheque. He was told by the councillors to watch himself and that if he did not phrase his remarks carefully, he would be sued for libel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His colleague, Councillor Burton, was not so lucky. She made a public statement that the public was entitled to know from each and every councillor what campaign contributions, hospitality and assistance, direct or indirect, they or their parties had received from developers, landowners, associated builders and their agents. She was sued for libel by no fewer than 42 of her colleagues. Solicitors acting on their behalf insisted there were no grounds to suggest bribery or corruption in Dublin County Council and they called on her to apologise and retract her allegations. We now know something different. The solicitors <Col N="109" /> referred to the distress and embarrassment caused to the councillors, their families, friends and associates, and sought an affirmation that they had &ldquo;always dealt with rezoning applications with the utmost integrity and having regard only to appropriate planning criteria&rdquo;. There is a stench of hypocrisy from those words.</P>
    <P>The media have an important role in maintaining a functioning democracy. I do not claim they are wholly responsible for exposing the corruption. Great credit must go to Michael Smith and Mr. Mac Eochaidh who put the original advertisement through the Newry solicitors. The stories published since then by Frank McDonald and Mark Brennock, who were the first to allude to the brown paper bag that is now part of public mythology, also played an important role.</P>
    <P>I accept the concerns of many people about giving greater freedom to the media. Greater freedom should also mean greater responsibility and accountability. These concerns can be dealt with in a comprehensive Bill by including the necessary safeguards. If a story is untrue, and there is no doubt that an untrue or malicious story can cause great distress to a person and their family, an immediate retraction and apology should be required. It ought to be given the same prominence as the original story. That ought to be sufficient redress.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the important issues of monopoly positions held by media moguls and the privacy laws. This can be done. However, there is now an urgent need to free journalists from the shackles of our restrictive libel laws. The Attorney General is already facing questions from the UN as a result of our restrictive practices in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were addressed by the Minister last night. However, the report of the Law Reform Commission makes sensible suggestions. The situation where there were £10 billion in claims over the last 15 years is intolerable in a democracy. The libel laws must be changed quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gormley on raising this matter. I am replying to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to be present.</P>
      <P>The arguments which blame our current defamation law for the perceived inability of the media to report fully and openly on matters which are of legitimate public interest are not wholly convincing. Undeniably, the media have a significant role to play in informing public opinion and, as legislators, we also have a role to play with regard to ensuring that the dissemination of information is encouraged to the greatest extent possible. However, at the same time, we must be conscious that, as in other areas of activity, the law must occasionally intervene to ensure that there is fairness and balance. In modern society, information is power and power, regardless of in whose hands it may be, must be regulated by the law to which, as citizens of this State, we are all subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere perhaps is the delicate balance that <Col N="110" /> has to be maintained between the media and society more in evidence than in the area of defamation law. This area of the law is complex and it is influenced by a variety of sources. Its purpose is both to protect and vindicate as far as possible the right of the individual to his or her good name while at the same time having due regard to the right of freedom of expression of others. Neither existing law, nor any possible new law, can ignore the need to balance these rights, both of which are expressly guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The right to privacy must be weighed against the right to freedom of the press. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Commission on the Newspaper Industry concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that neither of these constitutional rights is superior to the other but co-exist and must be balanced in their relationship. That is a view which many of us here would share.</P>
    <P>Any legislation which aims to modernise the law in this area must have added value. It must also have regard to the broad range of interests which it serves. In this context, defamation law is not solely for the benefit of the media although sometimes, when one listens to certain discussions, one might think this was the case. Certainly, one function of defamation law is to ensure that the media can fulfil their role without being subject to excessive restraint. However, defamation law is also there to protect the citizen and a citizen is not always a person of wealth and position. Reputation matters to all of us and we rely upon the law to come to our assistance when that reputation is unjustly attacked.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that some of the criticisms which have been made about the defamation law centre on the fact that the law does not recognise any special defence which could be used by the media when it is a politician or other public figure who is allegedly defamed. This situation is not unique to Ireland. Change in this area did not form part of the Law Reform Commission recommendations and many would be of the opinion that it is invidious to draw distinctions between different categories of plaintiff. All plaintiffs, be they public or private individuals, have a right to equal treatment when it comes to defamation proceedings.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that proposals for changes in the law on defamation were included in the report of the Law Reform Commission, The Civil Law of Defamation, published in December 1991. The commission's report contained more than 50 recommendations and the overwhelming majority of those recommendations are perhaps less radical in tenor than some in the media might suggest. Certainly, they do not offer a licence to print without taking due care and without engaging in the normal checking process which, for most of us in our daily lives, is an intrinsic part of the way in which we carry on business. However, taken as a whole, it cannot be denied that the recommendations put forward by the commission would, if implemented, result in a more modern code of defamation law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> A Defamation Bill is included in the Government's legislation programme. It is one of many Bills for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility. I understand some work on developing a scheme of a Bill has been done within the Minister's Department but that it is not possible at this time to state when proposals will be brought before Government for its consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> There have been extremely positive developments in relationships between people in Ireland and members of racial minorities. I do not believe a big majority are racist as is sometimes carelessly claimed. All over the country there are people of different racial origins, whether they be Irish born, Irish citizens born elsewhere, workers or students here for a period, who are going about their daily lives in harmony with their neighbours, workmates, fellow students and Irish people generally. Communities in many parts are extending a hand of friendship and solidarity to people seeking asylum in Ireland. Rathdrum, County Wicklow, and Cong, County Mayo, were recently featured on RTE News in that regard, and many other areas are doing similarly good work.</P>
      <P>It is with great regret and concern then that we see an entirely different attitude by some others in society. Members of racial minorities have been subjected to disgraceful attacks, verbal and physical, on the streets of Dublin on occasions. Recently a young African man was assaulted and in another incident an African run shop was attacked. It is unfortunate that members of racial minorities have often had to report verbal abuse, being jostled or even being spat upon. It is a small minority which is responsible for this manifestation of hatred, but it is a minority which should not be shown any tolerance. Anything which encourages the appalling mentality which leads to violent treatment of fellow human beings because their colour or culture is different should be rigidly opposed. The recent ignorant and bigoted outburst of a number of politicians is a case in point. Disgusting remarks branding asylum seekers as freeloaders and hoodlums encourage the warped mentality which results in racial attacks. The disgraceful casual mention of asylum seekers in the same breath as rapists and criminals, as unfortunately a Minister did on national radio on Tuesday morning, also can reaffirm those responsible for such attacks. Bigoted and opportunist statements in the mouths of politicians with the squalid aim of pandering to a retrograde minority in society can be readily translated into bottles and sticks in the hands of thugs inflicting violence on members of racial minority groups. Politicians who castigate an entire community, which does not have elected members to directly represent it, should be subjected to the strongest censure and to legislation prohibiting incitement to hatred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> The activities of land speculators, profiteers in housing and rack renting landlords who are responsible for a housing crisis must share responsibility as some people, under pressure by virtue of poverty and the lack of accommodation for themselves, mistakenly blame other poor people of different origins for their plight. The Government must carry its responsibility for failing to tackle this properly.</P>
    <P>Sections of the media must share responsibility also as they have run scaremongering headlines and articles about asylum seekers and racial minorities, and have written articles which are a tissue of lies in many cases &ndash; for instance, recently a national newspaper claimed falsely that there was a Nigerian protection racket in a part of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Garda must be obliged to take seriously any attack, verbal or physical, reported to it. There have been complaints about slow reaction times in some recent incidents. Community gardaí should be trained specially to deal sensitively with members of racial minorities and should work at the direction of community associations to revolve problems in the areas.</P>
    <P>Most especially, action by community associations is a key to harmony between people of different race, colour and culture. The Inner City Organising Network, which brings together community groups in that area of Dublin, is undertaking an important initiative to build harmonious community relationships bringing people together.</P>
    <P>Trades unions should also play a key role as they organise hundreds of thousands of workers in every area of society. One way or the other, any manifestation of hatred of people from different national backgrounds because of their colour or culture must be trenchantly dealt with by the public opinion of the vast majority of Irish people, by concrete community based action and by the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this urgent matter. It is and must be a basic concern of any Minister whose job it is to deal with the problem of public order to ensure that the evils of racism and the violence which has been associated with racism throughout the world are not allowed to take root. The fact that there have been racist attacks here already is something which everybody in this House and all right thinking people must condemn without equivocation. Since the beginning of the year, eight such incidents have been reported within the Dublin metropolitan region. The Minister is very aware that these attacks have led to a strong concern in refugee communities and among overseas students and immigrants generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to reassure minorities of the measures being taken to ensure their safety, each Garda district officer within the Dublin metropolitan region has been appointed as district liaison officer to liaise with persons subjected to racist attacks and harassment within the region. Each <Col N="113" /> superintendent is available to meet with any person whether subjected to a racist attack or with concerns in this area. District and divisional officers ensure that there is a systematic monitoring of such incidents. The names and telephone numbers of relevant superintendents were forwarded to Access Ireland and Comhlach, two interrelated organisations representing the asylum seeker, immigrant and foreign student communities. There is also close liaison between the Garda and the Traveller organisations. Divisional and district officers avail of every opportunity to ensure personnel under their control are sensitive to the concerns of minority race communities in the region.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society. They have hosted two international police conferences, co-funded by the European Commission and the Government, on the theme of policing a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Ireland. The training currently provided for student and probationer gardaí is being reviewed in the light of these conferences. Currently, all student and probationer gardaí receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their two year education and training programme.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an intercultural office in the Garda community relations section is another important development which demonstrates the commitment of the gardaí to preparing themselves for dealing with this important issue. Another recent Garda initiative was the setting up of a working group on policing and human rights, and the subsequent launch of the Garda Síochána human rights initiative for 1999-2000. One strand in this particular project is the establishment of an ethnic relations forum, which will provide for ongoing consultations between the Garda and ethnic groups. Another strand involves the production of a training and education video which will look at ethnic distinctions and how they impact on policing and the development of an ethnic relations strategy. It will be clear to the House that the Garda Síochána is fully aware of the problems and has been at the forefront of developing comprehensive and effective initiatives in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister established the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism in July 1998. This committee is a partnership of NGOs, State agencies, social partners and representatives of Departments. Its overall role is to act in a policy advisory role to Government. The Minister established an interdepartmental working group in December 1998 to formulate a strategy for implementing the Government's policy of responding positively to the needs of persons granted refugee status or leave to remain. The group recently finalised its report, which has been accepted by the Government as the framework for integration policy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed on the need for initiatives to combat racist attacks through <Col N="114" /> informing public opinion and promoting a more tolerant inclusive society. It has approved proposals for an evaluation of the strategy and resources needed to plan, implement and review the development of such initiatives, within a very short timeframe. The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism is currently carrying out the evaluation, which is due to be completed within the next month.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, last November the Minister launched the &ldquo;True Colours&rdquo; initiative, a two week programme aimed at making Irish society more inclusive of ethnic minorities. The programme, which was co-ordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, aimed to stimulate a more considered debate on what strategies are needed to respond more effectively to the needs of minority ethnic groups. Over 65 events took place at national, regional and local levels, in which community groups, schools and other organisations were encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, I wish to assure the House that neither he nor the Government as a whole underestimates the threat posed to our society by racism. Racism is unworthy of our country and our people. It is a violation of our most basic democratic values. The Minister will continue to use every possible means to protect ethnic minorities and the general public from this threat.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State for all seasons and all topics, Deputy Jacob. I do not think he has left the Dáil all day. I know he is Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise but he is exceeding himself today. I hope he will relay my message to the Minister for Education and Science on behalf of the parents of the children in St. Patrick's senior national school, Skerries.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 that school had an enrolment of 369 pupils, just one short of qualifying immediately for an extra teacher. However, this enrolment figure qualifies it automatically for an extra teacher in September 2000. On 7 September 1999 the principal of the school wrote to the Department of Education and Science pointing out that it would need an additional room to accommodate the extra teacher. Despite numerous telephone calls to the Department, and courteous treatment during those telephone calls, absolutely no action has been taken by the Department to confirm the provision of a prefabricated classroom to accommodate the extra teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal of the senior national school is well aware of the difficulties, even when a school is eligible for the extra teacher, because St. Patrick's junior national school in a previous year had qualified for an extra teacher but no accommodation was provided. Therefore, the junior <Col N="115" /> school was not able to take the extra teacher, unless it was willing to divide up classes which it did not wish to do. In other words, the principal of the junior school was left in the invidious position of not taking on an extra teacher which would have allowed smaller classes <i>versus</i> taking on the extra teacher, disrupting the rest of the school and losing a general purposes area.</P>
    <P>Despite the requests no inspection has been carried out to St. Patrick's senior national school since September 1999 so that a decision can be made to go ahead with the provision of the extra classroom. I call on the Minister to instruct an inspector to visit the school and give the go-ahead for the extra classroom. I do not want to see the senior school in the same position as the junior school and having to refuse an extra teacher due to a lack of accommodation. The parents will be deeply unhappy if this happens.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the additional teacher will enable the school to reduce the current third classes from three units of 36, 35 and 34 pupils into four units of approximately 26 pupils each. The lack of a decision is the most serious point I wish to stress to the Minister of State. I cannot understand why the Department, on the instruction of the Minister, cannot give the go-ahead for this classroom. The general purposes area is not available to be turned into a classroom. National schools should be allowed to keep their general purposes areas which are used for all sorts of activities, such as parent meetings, project work, confirmation meetings, PE, dancing, school Masses and many other necessary activities.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise with the Minister of State is that in early 1999 the Office of Public Works assessed the condition of the flat roof in this school and declared that it needed to be repaired immediately. The school prepared quotes through the Office of Public Works which were submitted to the Department of Education and Science last autumn. Again to date absolutely no action has been taken. No approval has been given for the repairs to be carried out even though rain is getting in through at least one corner of the roof. The Office of Public Works indicated there is a severe need for attention to the roof. I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>Another issue that will arise if the school management is forced to turn the general purposes area into a classroom is that there are no toilet facilities available in that area. There is a staff of 14 teachers and six other adults in the school and they will have to relinquish some of their toilets <Col N="116" /> if the general purposes room becomes a classroom. The school budget will not be able to stretch to providing furniture for the conversion of the general purposes room into a classroom. I would like confirmation from the Minister that he will approve not just the provision of the prefabricated classroom but of furniture to furnish the classroom. There is very little time to make a decision as the planning procedure will have to be followed and the classroom will have to be erected before the beginning of the September 2000 term. I urge the Minister to take immediate action on this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the provision of additional accommodation at St. Patrick's senior school, Skerries. At present, the staffing level at the school is a principal teacher, 12 assistant teachers and a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the school authorities seeking grant assistance towards additional permanent classroom and ancillary accommodation. This application is being examined in the context of a range of factors, including proposed housing developments in the general area. This examination will enable the Department to establish the likely pattern of future enrolments and, in that way, to determine the amount of school accommodation required.</P>
      <P>The school authorities may, if necessary, apply to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of temporary accommodation for the short-term needs of the school. Deputy Owen will appreciate that a very large number of school building projects are in hand within the Department. Due to the priority which this Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools, which was previously evident, the spending estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, the Department has significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by the management authorities of St. Patrick's senior school will be dealt with as speedily as possible and I thank her again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House. I will relay the sentiments so strongly expressed by Deputy Owen to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 17.22 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 May 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the United Nations, more than 790 million people do not have enough to eat and as many as two billion people globally lack essential nutrients at a time when there is enough food produced globally to meet the needs of all individuals. Surplus amounts of food produced at a global level do not necessarily translate into an adequate supply of food at a national, regional or local level. Availability of sufficient food and access to it are the key issues.</P>
      <P>Currently, most of the world's hungry people are found in southern and eastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Adverse weather conditions, including both drought and floods, often exacerbated by conflict, have put millions of people at risk.</P>
      <P>In the Horn of Africa up to 16 million people are affected by three consecutive years of poor rainfall. There is minimal food from harvests,  there is a shortage of water and livestock are dying or being sold prematurely. Pastoral areas of the sub-region, including south-eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and several parts of Somalia, have been particularly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hardest hit is Ethiopia, where more than eight million people are at risk, while in Kenya nearly 2.7 million people are facing severe food shortages. Past or ongoing civil conflicts are also disrupting food production and distribution, triggering food shortages and mass population displacements. With poor rainfall forecast for the sub-region during the current season, the number of people in need of assistance is anticipated to increase. I saw for myself the effects of the drought in Ethiopia during my visit there last week. Only a sustained international effort in the coming months in support of the affected populations can avert further human suffering and loss of life. This is being put in place under the leadership of the United Nations. Sufficient food aid has been committed for the needs as assessed at the moment. The crucial issue now is to translate these commitments into food arriving in the villages and remote areas. There is a two month period before the Meher or long rains to pre-position sufficient food to meet anticipated needs for the rest of the year. The chain of delivery is fragile and there are worries that the internal distribution capacity is weak, particularly with regard to short-haul trucking. The war with Eritrea has contributed to these logistical difficulties by absorbing trucking capacity. The <Col N="118" /> World Food Programme is working with the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission to try to address these issues. In my consultations with the Prime Minister and with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, I was given assurances that everything possible was being done to improve delivery of assistance.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, I was assured during my visit to Ethiopia that sufficient food to meet known needs has now been pledged. An up-dated analysis of all humanitarian needs is being carried out by the newly appointed United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator and this will lead to a revised assessment which is expected soon.</P>
    <P>The international community has responded generously to the appeals for assistance. Ireland, for its part, has committed a total of £2,859,000 to emergency assistance. Part of these funds comes from the emergency assistance budget and part from a reorientation of long-term funds to meet more immediate needs, in consultation with the Ethiopian authorities. In addition, many of Ireland Aid's area programmes are focused on long-term approaches to improving chronic food insecurity through agricultural development and land and water management. Emergency funds have been given to Irish NGOs which are doing excellent work and through the World Food Programme and UNICEF.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has committed a total of 542,526 mt for delivery over the next 12 months. There have been criticisms about delays in the delivery of food aid and I have raised these with Commissioner Nielson and will raise them again at the Development Council next week.  ECHO is assisting NGOs, primarily through support for supplementary feeding programmes. To date, 2 million euros has been disbursed through ECHO. An additional contribution of 3.3 million euros is being allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross and NGOs and further contributions are being examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 30 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the current accession process was launched by the 15 EU member states, the ten central and eastern European states and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. The following day, actual negotiations were inaugurated with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus. These countries are now referred to as the &ldquo;Luxembourg candidates&rdquo;. Negotiations have continued with these countries since then on a policy chapter basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a preparatory process for negotiations continued with the other original applicants, the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&ndash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. Malta joined this group in 1999.</P>
      <P>Based upon recommendations from the Commission, the Helsinki European Council on 10 December 1999 decided that the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;, including Malta, had reached such a level of preparation that accession negotiations could be opened in 2000. This group is now referred to as the Helsinki candidates. Negotiations with the Helsinki candidates began formally in Brussels on 15 February 2000. Actual substantive negotiations began in March, with the number and subject of negotiation chapters opened in accordance with the level of preparation in each country.</P>
      <P>The reaffirmation at Helsinki that the accession negotiation process for all 12 applicant countries should be on an equal footing and that each should proceed on the basis of its own merits and level of preparedness was significant. This should ensure that the new member states are capable of functioning effectively in the highly competitive European market.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council also decided that the European Union should be in a position to welcome new member states from the end of 2002, as soon as they have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership and once the negotiating process has been successfully completed.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council granted candidate status and an intensified pre-negotiation relationship with the EU to Turkey. Turkey will now benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. Significantly, this will entail a political dialogue with a particular emphasis on human rights. Actual accession negotiations cannot begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. These rigorous criteria of democracy, human rights, protection of minorities, and the rule of law are the same for Turkey as for all other applicant countries</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. We look forward to welcoming the new member states when they have satisfactorily completed their nego<Col N="120" /> tiations and have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership.</P>

      <P>The Government is certainly aware of the severe drought which is affecting India, as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan. Estimates differ as to the number of people badly affected but there is little doubt the figures run to tens of millions.</P>
      <P>Those areas affected by the drought are facing long-term problems with water supply. They are arid or semi-arid in climate and therefore even in years of so-called normal levels of rainfall they face water shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worst affected are the north-western states of India and in particular Rajasthan. There are two <Col N="121" /> principal causes to the current water shortages. First, last year's monsoon rains were lighter than usual and there has been little rain since that time. Second, the affected states are under increasing pressure from rapid population growth and consequently from over-farming of the land. At present the drought has struck most severely at pastoral farmers who are solely dependent on their livestock. The lack of suitable grazing is leading to substantial loss of livestock.</P>
    <P>While the situation is serious, it is currently being dealt with by the Indian Government in co-ordination with the UN and the Red Cross. The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor the situation closely and will respond if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that there are important discussions going on in the framework of the ECOFIN Council dealing with taxation matters. A high level working group established at the Helsinki European Council last December which has been mandated to progress an agreement on an EU tax package is to report back to ECOFIN in time for it to report to the European Council in June 2000 at the latest. The three key items of the tax package are: a code of conduct on business taxation, proposals for a directive on the taxation of income from savings, and proposals for a directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments between companies.</P>
      <P>These ongoing discussions on the tax package do not include consideration of whether the Commission will have a greater role in the area of taxation.</P>
      <P>As regards the Intergovernmental Conference, while there has been some discussion on the method of voting on taxation issues in the council, on which Ireland's views are well-known, there are no substantive proposals with regard to changing the role of the Commission in this area.</P>

      <P>The Government is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly aims at its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU has had a common position on the death penalty since June 1998, on the basis of which it has taken action in third countries. <Col N="122" /> Ireland along with our EU partners has, in line with the common position, raised the use of the death penalty with the US authorities on a number of occasions. The EU has made a number of humanitarian appeals to the US authorities for the commutation of the death sentences of a number of individuals. In addition, a general <i>démarche </i>was carried out in February on behalf of the EU by the EU Troika at ambassador level, to the US Under Secretary for Global Affairs, Mr. Frank Loy, in order to formally deliver an EU memorandum on the death penalty. At that meeting the use of the death penalty both at state and federal level was discussed.</P>
    <P>We welcome moves such as the moratorium imposed in the US State of Illinois on all pending executions in order to review death penalty procedures. We hope that this is a step on the road to the abolition of the death penalty in all 38 states and at federal level. The EU Troika, acting on behalf of the EU, has requested all US governors to follow the example of the Governor of Illinois.</P>
    <P>We particularly welcome Senator Russ Feingold's National Death Penalty Moratorium Bill which, if enacted, would impose a nationwide moratorium on executions while an independent commission conducts a thorough and comprehensive review of the death penalty. Moves by individual state senates such as Nebraska and New Hampshire should also be encouraged in their efforts to abolish the death penalty.</P>
    <P>We will continue with our EU partners to press for the total abolition of the death penalty. Ireland took an active role in ensuring maximum support for the EU-sponsored resolution on the death penalty at the recent 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. The resolution called upon all states which still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions, with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty. It was adopted following a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly supports the Middle East peace process and, together with our partners in the European Union, we are making every effort to encourage all the parties involved to work towards a just and lasting settlement.</P>
      <P>The peace process was relaunched with the signing of the Sharm-el-Sheikh Memorandum last September by President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak. This memorandum provided for implementation of existing agreements under the Wye River accord and the resumption of final status negotiations, to be concluded by 13 September.</P>
      <P>Since then a number of measures have been implemented, such as transfer of territory from Israeli to Palestinian control, release of Palestinian prisoners, and the opening of a safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Serious difficulties, however, have arisen in each of these areas.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the final status negotiations will have to address very complex problems if a comprehensive settlement is to be reached, such as the status of Jerusalem, water, settlements, borders, and return of refugees.</P>
      <P>The difficulties encountered had led to a standstill in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. In particular, there are disputes over what territory is to be transferred and over continued Israeli settlement building, as well as over Jerusalem and the shape of a future Palestinian state. The combination of these factors undoubtedly led to a loss of confidence in the negotiating atmosphere, particularly on the Palestinian side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This stalemate has now been broken and the Israelis and Palestinians have resumed nego<Col N="124" /> tiations. This is an encouraging sign, although progress is slow and the complexity of the problems to be tackled means that the deadline of 13 September for conclusion of the negotiations has now become a very ambitious one.</P>
    <P>We wish both parties every success in their efforts. At the same time, we would call on them to refrain from any acts which would complicate the negotiations further; to take all necessary measures to rebuild mutual confidence; to show a readiness to make concessions; and to focus their attention on the ultimate goal of lasting peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between Syria and Israel remain blocked. We regret that the recent meeting in Geneva between President Clinton and President Assad of Syria failed to agree a basis for renewed talks. Nevertheless, we believe that difficulties over the defining of the border can still be overcome and we hope that talks will resume in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the recent escalation of violence in Lebanon and we call on all sides to show restraint and return to the terms of the 1999 understanding, prohibiting the targeting of, or launching attacks from, civilian areas.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have taken note of commitments by the Lebanese, Syrian and Israeli Governments to co-operate with the UN on a complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July, in line with Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426. We would encourage them to take all necessary measures to allow a complete withdrawal in orderly conditions.</P>
    <P>On April 24, I met with the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Louise Fréchette, and senior officials of the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Political Affairs to discuss the Government's concerns about the safety and security of the Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL. I was assured by the Deputy Secretary-General that the UN shares our concerns for the safety and security of all UN personnel in southern Lebanon and that the UN is fully committed to sharing all information with troop contributing countries. UN special Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen has just completed a visit to the region to seek the full co-operation of all the parties and the strongest possible guarantees for the security of the members of UNIFIL after the withdrawal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation of East Timorese refugees in camps in West Timor, and of the activities of pro-Indonesian militias. This matter was addressed in my reply of 23 March to a previous question in the House. The situation is one of ongoing concern to the Government and, as I mentioned on that occasion, the Taoiseach, following his visit to East Timor on 9 March, raised it, and in particular militia activity and its impact on the refugees' freedom of choice, with President Wahid of Indonesia, the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, and his EU colleagues.</P>
      <P>There have been certain improvements in the situation since then. There has been a marked decrease in militia activity and a noticeable improvement in co-operation between the United Nations force in East Timor and the Indonesian Armed Forces on the other side of the border. On 11 April, a memorandum of understanding relating to co-operation in the border area was signed between both forces. It is hoped that, by improving security in the border area, an environment more conducive to the return of refugees will be created.</P>
      <P>Since the end of March some 7,000 additional refugees have been able to return to East Timor, bringing the total number of refugee returns to over 160,000. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recently reported that access to the camps has improved considerably and that the Government of Indonesia has been flexible in its continuation of aid to the refugees who remain in the camps. The House will recall that the Government of Indonesia had earlier indicated that aid to refugees in camps would be cut off after 31 March, but as a result of international pressure prior to that date they rescinded this decision.</P>
      <P>The UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration are facilitating the safe and orderly return to East Timor of all those refugees who wish to do so. The number of refugees who do not wish to return remains unclear, but estimates have put the figure as high as 60,000. These include civilian and military employees of the Indonesian state and their families, together with supporters of East Timorese integration with Indonesia. A survey which is currently being carried out by the UN, with the co-operation of the Indonesian authorities, and which will be completed shortly, should be of assistance in this regard. The UNHCR has requested a three month breathing space to allow time for the remaining refugees to choose freely whether to return to East Timor or stay in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House, however, that the matter, which was also raised with the Indonesian ambassador within the last month, is one which I am keeping under close review, and that pressure will be maintained for as long as necessary on the Indonesian authorities until it is brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>Mr. Li Lanqing, one of the Vice Premiers of China, and whose official responsibilities are in the areas of trade, investment and education, visited Ireland at the invitation of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The primary purpose of the visit was to promote our mutual economic and trade relations, bearing also in mind from our perspective the Government's Asia strategy. Vice Premier Li discussed the matters in detail with the Tánaiste and met representatives from our business promotional agencies in both Dublin and the Shannon region. Vice Premier Li paid a courtesy call on the Taoiseach and also had a private meeting with him. While the main purpose of the visit was to discuss economic issues, I understand that certain political issues were raised in the course of this private meeting.</P>
      <P>I did not meet nor have any discussions with Vice Premier Li. I met the Vice Premier briefly at a social event hosted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The time involved and the nature of the event did not allow for any substantive discussion.</P>

      <Quest>the action the Government has taken to pursue the objectives of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention since it came in to effect on 1 March 1999; if he will follow the example of the Canadian ambassador by appointing an ambassador for mine action to promote the global ban on such mines, encourage the development of alternatives in terms of military doctrine and technology, reduce stockpiles and fund mine clearance and assist mine victims.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland was one of the core group of countries which led the negotiation of the mine ban convention, and was one of the first three countries to sign and ratify the treaty, on the day it opened for signature, 3 December 1997. Since then, we have maintained our commitment by advocating the convention's full implementation and seeking to secure the signatures &ndash; and ratification &ndash; of all states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One indication of our commitment was the participation at the first meeting of states parties to the convention in Maputo in May last year of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, one of the few Foreign Ministers to attend. In the preparations for that meeting, and during the meeting itself, Ireland was actively engaged in the drafting of the meeting's final declaration and the programme of work for the per<Col N="127" /> iod leading up to the next meeting of states parties, which will be held in September this year.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have participated in the intersessional work undertaken on foot of the meeting of states parties, most notably in seeking to develop clarity in relation to devices which might function as anti-personnel mines. This work is crucial to ensuring that there is no weakening of the goals of the convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also given its full support to the development of the landmine monitor report, a civil-society based initiative to monitor the convention's implementation. In addition to providing over £100,000 towards the cost of producing the first report, Ireland hosted, in September 1998, the meeting of NGOs which launched the monitoring system. Since the launch of the first annual report at the first meeting of states parties last year, we have continued to offer our support to the initiative, participating once again this year in the meetings designed to assist researchers in producing their country reports. The second report of the monitor will be issued at the second meeting of states parties in September 2000.</P>
    <P>The amount of assistance which we have provided to mine action, including mine awareness, demining and victim assistance, has increased substantially over the years. Last year, Irish contributions amounted to £1,516,000. Projects were funded in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Angola and Somalia and included demining, mine awareness and victim support programmes.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role of Canada, another member of the core group of countries, for its efforts to achieve the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines. Canada remains very active in this area. Canada is able, however, to devote significantly greater resources to disarmament work than we can. Much as we might wish to appoint a special official at ambassadorial level to promote these activities, the level of available resources would not permit this.</P>

      <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the UN to advance the process towards a political settlement in Cyprus in the current round of talks between both sides. Although the backdrop to the talks has improved following the recent improvement in Greek-Turkish relations, it is difficult to predict the likelihood of substantial progress being achieved. The Government has urged the parties to make every effort to move the process forward. It has also been made clear to them and to the United Nations that Ireland is ready <Col N="128" /> to provide any assistance which would be considered useful in promoting progress.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash agreed to take part in UN-sponsored indirect or proximity talks with Cypriot President Glafeos Clerides. These proximity talks took place from 3 to 14 December. A second round of talks was held from 31 January to 8 February this year. The purpose of these two rounds of talks was to prepare the groundwork for comprehensive negotiations. Four core issues are on the table in these discussions: security, territory, property, including compensation, and distribution of powers. The talks are due to restart in New York later this month, but they may be postponed due to the illness of President Clerides. The UN mediator, Alvaro De Soto, has confirmed that the next round of talks will also be based on indirect meetings.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the UN framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal approach remains the appropriate one for an eventual settlement to the Cyprus issue. We have a particular interest in a successful outcome to the peace process. Ireland has contributed from the outset to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cyprus and we currently have 20 personnel with UNFICYP. The Government hopes that the recent positive developments in Greek-Turkish relations can be built upon and that these developments will help to facilitate concrete progress towards a settlement in Cyprus.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains concerned at the situation in Chechnya. The main military campaign appears to be over but sporadic fighting continues, particularly in the southern mountains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the centre of our concerns are the innocent civilians who have been caught up in this conflict. According to rough estimates, approximately 20,000 civilians remain in the devastated Chechen capital, Grozny, where a second UNHCR aid convoy arrived recently. An estimated 185,000 Chechens are still in the neighbouring Russian Republic of Ingushetia. The ICRC is scheduled to gain access to detention centres within the next ten days. Ireland has allocated £310,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen internally displaced persons, to augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of £7.4 million. <Col N="129" /> We will continue to do everything possible to alleviate the plight of civilians.</P>
    <P>Efforts continue by the international community to promote a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The EU has repeatedly emphasised to Russia the seriousness with which it views the situation in Chechnya, as has been outlined to the House in previous replies. There have been a number of high level discussions of the issue with the Russian authorities, including at the EU-Russia Co-operation Council on 10 April. The EU-Russia Summit on 29 May will provide a further opportunity to review developments and examine how to promote progress towards a settlement.</P>
    <P>The OSCE has reached agreement with Russia for the return of the OSCE assistance mission to the region and 62 OSCE monitors are being deployed on the Chechnya/Georgia border to prevent conflict spillover.</P>
    <P>Considerable emphasis has been placed, particularly by last month's session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, on the need for a thorough and transparent investigation of allegations of human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>Russia has taken a number of steps in response to international concerns. President Putin has appointed a Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, Mr Kalamanov. A Commission on Human Rights, Displaced Persons and the Normalisation of the Social, Political and Economic situation in the Chechen Republic has been established in the Duma. In addition, a National Public Commission for Investigating Crimes and Monitoring Respect for Human Rights in the North Caucasus has been established, under the chairmanship of the former Minister for Justice, Mr. Krascheninnkov.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I successfully negotiated the assignment of a number of Council of Europe experts to work in the office of the Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, Mr. Kalamanov. It is hoped that these experts will be able to be deployed shortly. I also continually stressed to the Russian authorities, most recently in the course of two bilateral meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov in Luxembourg on 10 April and in New York on 24 April, the importance of opening dialogue with elected Chechen representatives and the need for a credible and transparent investigation of allegations of human rights abuses with effective procedures for bringing the perpetrators to justice. I discussed these matters again with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov informally last night in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>The discussion continued this morning in Strasbourg at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers which I chaired. At the close of their discussions, the Ministers concluded that steps were being taken by Russia towards meeting the concerns of the Council of Europe, including those raised by the Parliamentary Assembly. The Ministers will keep the issue of Chechnya on their agenda and follow developments with the closest attention, also with a view to reporting to <Col N="130" /> the June part-session of the Parliamentary Assembly, as requested in Recommendation 1456.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, keep the House informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Helsinki European Council in December 1999, Heads of State and Government adopted a European Union Drugs Strategy for 2000 to 2004. This succeeded the EU Drugs Strategy 1995-99 and sought to continue the existing global, multidisciplinary, integrated and balanced approach of the EU to the worldwide drugs problem, while placing a new emphasis on evaluation. The strategy also sets out the aims and targets of EU anti-drugs activities during the period, whereby the Union will implement the action plans and measures adopted at the UN Special Session on the World Drug Problem in 1998; intensify its cooperation with the UN, other international organisations and NGOs; and integrate its drug related activities into the broader objectives of external relations and development.</P>
      <P>Within these overall goals, the new EU drugs strategy seeks to address the problem in a balanced way by seeking to reduce both supply and demand. On the supply side, one of the key aims of this strategy is to reduce illicit cultivation by actions such as the promotion of alternative development. On the subject of alternative development, the strategy document asserts that:</P>
      <P>Development co-operation should assist population groups that are giving up illegal crops to create alternative sources of income. Particularly important in this context are programmes of alternative development in countries producing illicit drug plants, in co-ordination with UNDCP where appropriate.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the EU committed 9.8 million euro to North-South co-operation schemes in the context of the campaign against drug abuse and in 1998 a total of almost 8 million ECU. Payments so far in 2000 are almost 10.5 million euro. From the statistics available to us, it is difficult to extrapolate full details of the individual projects supported by the EU. We have asked the European Commission for full details of the schemes and they are working on our request. As soon as full details become available I will, of course, forward them to the Deputy.</P>

I hosted a working dinner for Mr. Solana following this lecture.</P>
      <P>Over dinner, Mr. Solana and I had an exchange of views on the situation in Russia in the wake of the election of President Putin a few days earlier. Mr. Solana had met Mr. Putin on a number of occasions and was favourably impressed by his well prepared approach. There was a long discussion on the Chechnya problem and the EU approach to it.</P>
      <P>The situation in Serbia and Kosovo also arose, specifically the effectiveness of sanctions against Serbia and the issue of future elections in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>The prospects for progress in the Middle East peace process were also raised. In particular, I raised the question of the expected Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon and expressed the Government's concern over the possible risks to the safety of UNIFIL which could arise in the event of a unilateral withdrawal.</P>
      <P>There was also a discussion of the possibilities for improved relations between Iran and the United States, as the reform process under Iranian President Khatami progresses.</P>
      <P>The High Representative and I reviewed developments to date in the Intergovernmental Conference.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>In line with Ireland's unique role in proposing the non-proliferation treaty and its promotion over the 30 years of its existence, the Government continues to pursue the goal of early elimination of nuclear weapons, wherever we are represented, including at the NPT review conference which is currently taking place in New York.</P>
      <P>This conference opened on Easter Monday. Reflecting Ireland's traditional role in relation to the non-proliferation treaty, I was amongst the first speakers on that day. In my address I set out my view of the current serious situation, including the challenges which threaten the future of the treaty itself. I also explained in detail the thinking which underpinned the new agenda coalition, of which Ireland is a leading member, and its proposal &ldquo;Towards a Nuclear Weapons Free World&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The treaty was extended indefinitely in 1995 and a strengthened review mechanism was set in place at the same time in anticipation of an acceleration of the process of nuclear disarmament and the consequent need for greater interaction between the nuclear weapon and the non-nuclear weapon states parties. In spite of some significant steps by some nuclear weapon states, the nuclear arms reduction process has faltered in the intervening five years. Regrettably, there is little evidence of a willingness on the part of the nuclear weapon states to consider the elimination of their nuclear arsenals in the foreseeable future. There is now a risk that the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons will become a norm in the post Cold War era. Recent developments in India and Pakistan  &ndash; neither of whom are signatories to the treaty &ndash; are further signs of such a development.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, for his initiative on nuclear disarmament. The new agenda initiative, as it is known, charts the route to the achievement of nuclear disarmament through concrete steps and processes. It has already received widespread support in the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the conference currently under way in New York, the Irish delegation, together with the more than 60 co-sponsors of the new agenda initiative, will attempt to secure a commitment from the nuclear weapon states that will set the elimination of nuclear weapons not within a perspective of unlimited duration, but within a timeframe determined by the limitations of these steps and processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference will continue until 19 April. While I would hope that there will be an agreed and successful outcome along the lines which I <Col N="133" /> have indicated, I am not in a position to say today that this will in fact be the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 74 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's concern about the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia, I travelled to the region last week to assess the status of the emergency relief effort and the effectiveness of the response by the international community. I also availed of the opportunity to assess Ireland Aid's programmes which are aimed at long-term development which addresses the root causes of poverty and vulnerability to humanitarian crises.</P>
      <P>Not all of the country is similarly affected and many areas, although chronically food-insecure, have sufficient capacity to mitigate the worst affects of the three year drought with the support of the Ethiopian authorities and the international community.</P>
      <P>I had discussions on the overall situation and the current emergency with the Ethiopian authorities including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Deputy Commissioner of the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Commission. I also had consultations with the secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity which was facilitating proximity talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea in Algiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives from the Irish NGOs, Concern, GOAL and Self-Help International who briefed me on their work in Ethiopia. I was present at the first day of a supplementary feeding project being run by Concern in Wollita in southern Ethiopia and saw the severe effects of the drought on very vulnerable children and mothers. I also met with the director of the World Food Programme to discuss the status of the <Col N="134" /> response to appeals for international humanitarian assistance. I was assured that the donor community, including the EU and the USA, had pledged sufficient food aid for the current emergency as it stands.  She indicated that it will be necessary to revise the amount of assistance needed as more detailed information becomes available on the arrival or not of the much needed rains.  The provision of water supplies and basic medicines are also crucial if lives are to be saved.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the key issue now is to ensure that the chain of delivery of food remains unbroken so that food arrives in time from the ports to the areas most in need. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has just appointed a senior official as special humanitarian co-ordinator to work with the Government and the UN agencies to strengthen the humanitarian response. Work is proceeding on improving key logistical and infrastructural capacity in order to ensure effective delivery of relief assistance.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the current crisis Ireland has allocated £2,859,000 for emergency needs. This includes funds from the emergency aid budget and a reorientation of some programme funds in consultation with the Ethiopian authorities. Ireland commenced a development assistance programme in Ethiopia in 1994. The programme is focused on long-term sustainable development in partnership with the Ethiopian authorities and people. The programmes help prevent or at least mitigate the worst affects of drought and chronic food shortages. I was able to see the positive effects of this approach during my visit to Tigray last week where Ireland Aid is working with the local authorities and people on agricultural development and land and water management.</P>
    <P>Some concerns have been raised about ensuring that assistance reaches those most in need. This is an issue which arises in many humanitarian emergencies. In countries where there is conflict no long-term development funds are paid to the central treasury but are used at local and regional level. All inputs and outputs are monitored carefully by embassy staff. Additional emergency funding is usually given through international agencies and NGOs who give assurances that assistance will go directly to the most vulnerable groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland and the international community works at two levels to alleviate hunger and the threat of famine in Africa, through long-term development and through a <Col N="135" /> speedy and effective response to humanitarian emergencies as they arise.  Support for long-term sustainable development which aims to reduce poverty, the root cause of vulnerability to chronic food deficiencies, is crucial to saving lives. Countries must be empowered to prevent or at least mitigate the worst effects of these cyclical weather-related emergencies.</P>
      <P>The international community is also working with national and local governments to improve early warning systems and to put in place effective national disaster response mechanisms and processes. It is particularly important that these mechanisms are in place in disaster-prone countries.  Both the United Nations and the European Union support these types of initiatives on an on-going basis. Ireland, through our missions to the UN and the EU, participates actively at official level in these efforts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are consistent in our interest in improving the situation of the millions of chronically food insecure people in Africa and elsewhere in the world. I have just returned from an assessment visit to Ethiopia where I saw for myself the effects of three years of drought. I had discussions with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. I also held consultations with the director of the World Food Programme. The Secretary-General of the UN has appointed a special humanitarian co-ordinator to ensure that the necessary assistance reaches those most in need in the Horn of Africa in the most effective way. The Secretary-General has also set up a special committee to look at long-term food security in the region.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia at the last General Affairs Council and I will be raising it with my colleagues at the Development Council next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the international community's commitment in general to addressing the problem of chronic food shortages in parts of Asia and Africa, in 1996 the World Food Summit agreed a target of reducing the number of food insecure people by half by the year 2015. At the international level Ireland Aid is working with its partners in the UN and the EU to achieve this target.</P>
      <P>The international Food Aid Convention, of which Ireland is a member, has the objective of securing the World Food Conference target of at least ten million tonnes of food aid annually for developing countries. The convention was recently updated to provide greater flexibility in the provision of food aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not directly a donor of food aid. Our support takes the form of our involvement in the EU's food aid programme and through our cash donations to the World Food Programme. We also fund Irish and international NGOs and international humanitarian agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund in their efforts <Col N="136" /> to reduce hunger. The main UN agencies dealing with food issues are the World Food Programme, the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Ireland funds all of these organisations.</P>
    <P>In 2001 Ireland will become a member of the board of the World Food Programme which will enable us to make a substantive policy contribution to the important work of this UN agency. Food aid has traditionally represented a large proportion of EU aid. However, in recent years it has declined to 5%-8% of the overall EU aid budget as spending in this area has shifted to longer term food security projects.</P>
    <P>The EC regulation governing food aid focuses on the need for a long-term sustainable solution to the problem of food in security and emphasises the importance of development operations that are geared to stimulating local production and trade.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the EU food aid working group which co-ordinates policy on food aid. We also sit on the Food Security and Food Aid Committee which deals with the practical aspects of food aid projects and approves all Commission proposals for food aid in excess of two million euros.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 46 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Working to promote and support international efforts to ensure that appropriate safeguards and restraints apply to the sale and transfer of arms, and that the destabilising accumulation of arms is brought to an end is a key priority of Irish foreign policy. To that end we are not only actively engaged in the EU context, but also at the United Nations or wherever like-minded countries which share this goal are at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>COARM is the acronym used to describe is the European Union's working group on conven<Col N="137" /> tional arms exports. Its primary function is the co-ordination of controls on the export of conventional arms and related items from the EU to third countries. It meets on a regular basis and, as required, supplementary meetings of experts are held on specific technical issues.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency in 1996, some initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for use by arms export licensing authorities were agreed. This work was then built on to develop a code of conduct on arms exports which was agreed in 1998. While the code did not go as far as we would have wished, and that was made clear at the time, it can be seen as a concrete starting point to establish basic standards which can be broadened and deepened.</P>
    <P>Since then the Union has been promoting the code as a common standard to be also adopted by third countries outside the Union who are engaged in arms exports. At the same time work is ongoing within the Union to ensure a fuller and better implementation of the code through the compilation of a common list of military equipment to be subjected to export controls. The work on the compilation of this common list is expected to be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve fuller and more effective control of arms exports and material from EU member states, Ireland more recently took the initiative of having measures considered which we hope will lead to the adoption of regulations to control arms brokerage. The necessary detailed work on this will commence shortly. It is also to be expected, once the Union has adopted such regulations on arms brokerage, that these will be implemented by the associated and like-minded countries. For our part we will be encouraging them to implement such regulations.</P>
    <P>As has been our practice to date, Ireland will continue to work to achieve in full the objectives of the EU code of conduct on arms exports and to have in place at an early date the regulations on arms brokerage to which I have just referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, together with its EU partners, is following closely the situation in Angola, including the significant developments registered on the military front in recent months. In January of this year, we restated our conviction that there is no alternative to a political settlement in bringing peace and stability to the country and people of Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with its EU partners, the Government has reiterated that UNITA bears the prime responsibility for the war in Angola. We have <Col N="138" /> expressed concern about UNITA's persistent defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, and its failure to comply with key provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. We fully support the Security Council sanctions, which aim to promote peaceful settlement by limiting UNITA's ability to pursue its objectives by military means. In this context we welcome the report last March by the panel of experts established by the UN Security Council on the violation of security council sanctions against UNITA. The Security Council considered the report on 18 April and adopted a resolution, taking the monitoring of the implementation of sanctions a stage further. We have urged UNITA to cease military activities and to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The EU continues to encourage the Angolan Government to create a political, social and economic environment for democracy which will foster respect for the rule of law in Angola. In this regard, we have stressed that the Government has a special responsibility for the promotion of human rights, democratic principles, good governance and the strengthening of a free civil society, including in areas controlled by UNITA.</P>
    <P>We have also called on the Government of Angola, as a signatory of the Ottawa Convention, and on UNITA, to immediately cease mine-laying activities in the country. In addition, we have expressed concern at the recent fighting between Angolan Armed Forces and UNITA across international borders in the area, and have stressed the importance of stability and inter-state co-operation in the region.</P>
    <P>Together with our European partners, we will be ready to consider how to assist the Government of Angola in facing the challenges of rebuilding and reconstructing the country within a democratic environment, and will continue to give particular attention to the alleviation of the suffering of the Angolan population affected by the conflict. The EU common position on Angola, adopted by the Council in 1995, is currently being updated and will be considered by the council in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Relations between India and Pakistan have been difficult since both states were established in 1947, and any tension between them is a matter of great concern. Such concern is further compounded by the fact that both countries have now acquired nuclear weapons capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in February 1999 resulted in the Lahore Declaration, which stated that both countries would endeavour to resolve their differences through peaceful negotiation. This was a welcome and promising development. However, <Col N="139" /> the Kargi incident last summer in Kashmir, which left an estimated 1,000 soldiers dead on each side, followed by the shooting down of a Pakistani aircraft in August by the Indian air force, were serious reverses. The overthrow, in October 1999, of the civilian Government of Pakistan by the military under General Musharraf, was a further negative development, as were the mutual tensions resulting from the hi-jacking of an Indian airliner and accusations by the Indian authorities of complicity in terrorism on the part of Pakistan.</P>
    <P>Throughout this period the EU, both collectively and through the bilateral contacts of individual member states, including Ireland, has availed of every opportunity to make our serious concern known to both parties and to urge both the Indian and Pakistani Governments towards restraint, dialogue and the resolution of their differences through negotiation. The EU will continue to follow this course of persuasion. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the success of this approach will depend primarily on a positive response from both of the parties to which it is addressed. While I would hope that both sides will continue to exercise the restraint which we have seen more recently, I am not in a position to say when there may be any significant improvement in the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western European and Others&rdquo; group of states for the two year term 2001-02. The election, which will take place at the UN General Assembly in October, is being contested by two other candidates, Norway and Italy. Turkey withdrew its candidacy on 10 February 2000. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs intend to maintain fully the level of lobbying activity as the campaign intensifies in these final months of the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Since the Minister for Foreign Affairs came to office, he has taken up the Security Council candidacy in the course of a number of bilateral visits and, most recently, at the United Nations NPT review conference in New York. I, myself, accompanied the Taoiseach to the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo last month where I undertook a number of bilateral meetings to promote the Security Council candidacy.</P>
    <P>I should also like to put on record the excellent work done by Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, at numerous international conferences and fora at which they have taken the opportunity to lobby intensively. The Dáil will be aware that since this is a strongly contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say simply that our candidacy continues to attract a high level of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>NGOs are one valuable means of channelling aid for poverty reduction in line with the overall focus of the Ireland Aid programme. Irish NGOs, including our missionary orders, have a strong tradition and considerable experience of working with the poorest of the poor in developing countries. The Government has recognised, in developing a partnership with NGOs over the years, that NGOs have strengths which can contribute to its overall strategies, particularly their ability to work directly with the poorest of the poor.</P>
      <P>The partnership between Ireland Aid and NGOs, therefore, recognises the close contacts which many NGOs have with local communities and the potential this creates for reaching the poor, giving them a voice, and building their capacity to be involved in and to determine their own development. In 1998, for example, a total of £20.7 million or roughly 15% of total ODA was channelled through NGOs.</P>
      <P>I believe that, in a situation of increased funding for the overall programme, the role of NGOs in the programme can and should be strengthened. However, I believe that enhanced funding should be combined with a more strategic approach to the way aid is delivered through development programmes co-financed with our NGOs and with increased focus being given to outcomes and impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five of the largest Irish NGOs &ndash; Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Christian Aid &ndash; receive an annual <Col N="141" /> block grant from Ireland Aid for longer term development projects. My Department is currently in discussion with these NGOs concerning putting these funding arrangements on a multi-annual basis, which would facilitate them in better planning of development activities and provide greater assurance regarding funding. It would also help these NGOs strengthen their relationships with local partners. As part of this, we are reviewing existing block grant provisions to continue to ensure that funding is consistent with agreed priorities, that public funds continue to be adequately accounted for and that aid continues to be of high quality. The question of a specific budget line for NGOs is being looked at in the context of a current review of the expanding aid programme. Proposals on this and other issues will shortly be brought to Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Robert Hamill died on 8 May 1997 following an attack in Portadown. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. Six people were charged in 1997 with his murder, but the charges in relation to five were dropped before they came to trial. Only one was convicted on 25 March 1999 for the offence of causing an affray and not of murder. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints supervised the RUC investigation into the actions of the RUC officers on the night in question, following which a report was sent to the DPP. On 30 September 1999 the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any RUC officer. The RUC file on the case remains open.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the case has been actively pursued with the British authorities both at official and ministerial level. In October 1999, the Government's disappointment at the DPP's decision and the widespread and deep concern that exists about this case was conveyed personally to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>The grave dissatisfaction about the case which exists throughout the Nationalist community and among human rights groups and others has led, understandably, to a mounting number of calls for a public inquiry, for which there are strong grounds.

      <P>When I addressed the NPT review conference in New York a fortnight ago I welcomed the legislative steps taken for the ratification of START II by the Duma of the Russian Federation as a significant step in the process of nuclear disarmament. By taking this step it now only remains for the United States to ratify the relevant protocols for the full implementation of the treaty to commence. The ratification of START II will further enable negotiations on START III to commence, with the prospect of further substantial negotiations on nuclear arms reductions.</P>
      <P>All the nuclear weapon states with the exception of China state that they will be the first to use nuclear weapons in certain cases. The recent restatement by the Russian Federation of its first use posture in respect of nuclear weapons mirrors that of the three western nuclear weapon states.</P>

Among the proposals contained in that initiative is a call for the nuclear weapon states to adapt their nuclear weapon policies and postures in such a manner as to preclude the use of nuclear weapons. There is of course no alternative to the total elimination of nuclear weapons if humanity is to be spared the consequences of the use of these weapons either intentionally or accidentally.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a proactive policy designed to develop Ireland's political and economic relations with Asia. The essential components of this policy are set out in the Government's Asia strategy, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>The economic importance of Asia means that in the long-term Ireland cannot afford to ignore opportunities arising in Asian markets from either a trade, investment or national competitiveness point of view.</P>
      <P>The Government is of the view that Asia has an important contribution to make to Ireland's foreign earnings interests in four key areas: as a source of sustainable, high quality employment; as a means of diversifying the sources of such employment; as a means of allowing for the diversification of trade so that we stay close to expanding markets and avoid declining markets; and as a source for the promotion of domestic wealth generation and innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Asia strategy has two principal objectives, namely, to improve political and business contacts in the region and to raise aware<Col N="144" /> ness of Ireland both as an investment location and as a source of high quality goods and services.</P>
    <P>A committee comprised of representatives from the public and private sectors has been established to oversee the implementation of the Asia strategy. The role of this committee is to develop a comprehensive economic approach for the region and to ensure that goals common to political, trade, enterprise and foreign direct investment objectives are identified and addressed in a systematic way in each of the main markets.</P>
    <P>The Government has also increased the level of Ireland's representation in the Asia Pacific region by the establishment of an Ireland House in Singapore, Shanghai and Sydney.</P>

The Government is of the view that, when fully implemented, the recommendations of the report will contribute towards achieving a criminal justice system consistent with the aims set out in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group provides a comprehensive and wide-ranging view of the Northern Ireland criminal justice system, other than policing and those aspects of the system relating to emergency legislation. Particularly significant amongst its recommendations are those which deal with the establishment of an independent public prosecution service, an attorney general for Northern Ireland and a judicial appointments commission. The report also contains recommendations for structured co-operation between the criminal justice agencies on both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The British Government has begun a six month process of consultation on implementation of the report. This is scheduled to end on 29 September. My Department is currently engaged in a detailed analysis of the recommendations of the report.</P>

      <P>Following the Government's decision of 28 September 1999 to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, Ireland's first ambassador to that country, who is resident in Mexico City, presented his credentials in Havana on 31 March this year. It is expected that the Cuban authorities will shortly request the accreditation to this country of their ambassador in London.</P>
      <P>The way is now open for a development of the friendly relations which already exist between Ireland and Cuba, and a strengthening of our ties across the board, including political, economic, social and cultural exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with our partners, we subscribe to the EU common position on Cuba, which was originally adopted under the Irish Presidency of the EU in December 1996. The aim of the common position is to foster a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. In the spirit of the common position, Ireland and our EU partners oppose the US embargo against Cuba and we have consistently <Col N="146" /> conveyed this view to the US authorities, as well as regularly voting against the embargo at the UN General Assembly, together with all our EU partners. However, the common position also makes clear that full co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent and enduring absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country. More than three years after the adoption of the common position, and notwithstanding some improvements in terms of religious tolerance following the Pope's visit to the island in January 1998, the situation remains substantially the same.</P>
    <P>At the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU once again called on Cuba to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN, and those EU member states currently sitting on the Commission voted for the resolution criticising Cuba's human rights performance. Regrettably, Cuba chose to react to the most recent resolution by withdrawing an invitation to a European Union Troika at Deputy Foreign Minister level, which was due to visit Havana at the end of April for discussions with the Cuban authorities in the context of the EU's commitment to the maintenance of dialogue with Cuba. Havana also withdrew its application to join the ACP Convention.</P>
    <P>It is, however, the Government's wish and intention to continue a dialogue with Cuba on these and other issues, in a spirit of friendship and goodwill. At the same time, and building on our newly established diplomatic links, we will work to develop and strengthen the overall political, economic and cultural relations between our two countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission for Racial Equality in Britain in 1997 published a report on Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain which concluded that there was a &ldquo;widespread and almost unquestioned acceptance of anti-Irish racism in British society&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report drew attention to discrimination in <Col N="147" /> a number of areas and contained recommendations to Government agencies, statutory bodies, voluntary agencies and private companies about addressing this situation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has welcomed the report's highlighting of the extent of the particular difficulties, based on prejudice or discrimination, which Irish people frequently encounter in Britain. We have also expressed support for the recommendations of remedial action addressed to British Government agencies and other organisations whose activities impinge on the welfare and interests of the Irish community. The British Home Secretary has also welcomed the commission's initiative in raising awareness of the issues covered by the report and he has undertaken to ensure that the concerns raised will be given proper attention.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the report &ndash; that the separate ethnicity of Irish people be recognised by the inclusion of an &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; ethnic category in the census of population in Britain &ndash; will be implemented for the first time in the 2001 census in England and Wales.</P>
    <P>Where it receives evidence of serious anti-Irish prejudice or discrimination, our Embassy in London brings complaints to the attention of the public bodies involved. Complainants are informed of the legal redress options available to them under the British Race Relations Act.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that anti-Irish racism is as repugnant to the British Government as it is to us. In our dealings with them we take every opportunity to remind them of the importance of sensitivity by public authorities towards the special needs of the Irish community. Discussions are taking place at present between our Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the British Department of Social Security about co-operation in countering social exclusion and, in that context, addressing the particular social and health problems of Irish people in Britain.</P>
    <P>My Department and the embassy in London will remain vigilant with regard to progress in implementing the Commission for Racial Equality report. The Deputy can also be assured that action will be taken whenever it is required to protect Irish citizens in Britain from prejudice or discrimination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to raise during my visit the <Col N="148" /> Government's concerns about the safety of the Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL, particularly in the context of Israel's announcement that it will withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon by 7 July. On Monday 24 April, I met with the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Louise Fréchette, and senior officials of the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Political Affairs. I emphasised the absolute priority that the Government attaches to the safety and security of our troops. I was assured by the Deputy Secretary-General that the UN shares our concerns for the safety and security of all UN personnel in southern Lebanon and that the UN is fully committed to sharing all information with troop contributing countries. The UN is engaged in contingency planning for the post-withdrawal situation and the Secretary-General's special envoy has just made a fact-finding visit to the region.

      <P>Abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to all, and the perpetrators of such abuses should be brought to justice in accordance with law. Throughout the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by the regime. As a practical expression of our sympathy with the victims of those violations, we welcomed Chilean refugees into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether General Pinochet will now be sent for trial following his return to Chile is a matter for the judicial authorities there. In recent weeks the investigating judge who has been inquiring into allegations against the general, was joined by law officers of the Chilean State in seeking to have the appeals court find that he does not have immunity from prosecution, even under the existing amnesty legislation, in the case of certain grave crimes which took place following the 1973 <i>coup d'état.</i> Against the objections of lawyers for General Pinochet, the court agreed to hear the case. The hearing <Col N="149" /> has concluded and a verdict is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>President Lagos, who took office in March, has pointed out that recognition by the executive branch of the freedom and independence of the judicial system is the hallmark of democratic respect for the rule of law. On 27 April last, after the opening of the appeals court hearing, President Lagos commented: &ldquo;.the institutions function. As we have said to the world, in this country everyone, powerful or humble, is subject to the courts.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 93 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> In the immediate aftermath of the Mozambican floods assistance worth IR£2,365,000 was provided by Ireland to address humanitarian needs. A sum of £700,000 was allocated from the emergency humanitarian budget and to support the distribution of emergency relief items by both UN agencies and the Irish NGOs working in the region. The remaining £1.65 million was reallocated from the bilateral aid programme for emergency medicines and reconstruction and recovery activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland was represented at the recent Mozambique donor's conference in Rome, where we pledged a further £4.5 million: for road reconstruction, £2.8 million, and debt relief, £1.7 million. Importantly, this money will actually be disbursed by the end of this year due to the excellent work which has already been carried out by our embassy in co-operation with the Mozambican authorities.</P>
    <P>Throughout the initial emergency response, and now as reconstruction has begun, Ireland's assistance has been well focused and disbursed quickly thanks to the experience of long-term development in Mozambique. The Mozambican Government has emphasised the need for relief and reconstruction efforts to be carried out with a minimum of interference with ongoing development programmes. Therefore, Ireland will continue to provide the £7.4 million committed for long-term development aid in 2000.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has already contributed IR£5 million to a national debt relief programme in Mozambique in the period 1997-99. We firmly believe that because of Mozambique's tremendous development efforts, as well as the appalling set-backs of February-March this year due to the floods, there is a compelling argument for total debt cancellation. The Taoiseach made these views known to President Chissano, when they met <i>en marge</i> of the Cairo Summit in early April. Ireland has always held the view that the huge debt burden on poor developing countries is a major constraint to their development and must be recognised as such. We are pleased with the international attention being given to this important issue. We will continue to press for a generous and flexible response by the international community to debt relief and debt cancellation.</P>

      <P>Our concerns in relation to human rights in China are well known to the Chinese authorities and have been raised with them bilaterally on a number of occasions. Most recently at the 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland was fully associated with the EU country statement in which deep concern was expressed about the fact that, despite some steps in the improvement of the legal system and social and economic rights, little progress has been achieved on the ground, in particular regarding civil and political rights. Continuing restrictions upon fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, expression, religion, assembly and association, were also firmly condemned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 71 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided the context and the opportunity &ldquo;for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;. The Patten report, published in September 1999, comprehensively addressed the full range of important and sensitive issues related to policing. Since the publication of the report, the Government has engaged in frequent meetings with the British authorities with regard to the implementation of the report's recommendations and these meetings are ongoing in the context of the implementation of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a statement by the Secretary of State on 19 January 2000 indicating acceptance of the essential substance of the Patten recommendations, the British Government is currently pre<Col N="152" /> paring a new Bill on policing in Northern Ireland, as well as preparing specific implementation plans. It is expected that both will be published shortly, and that the legislation will be enacted by November of this year.</P>
    <P>The Patten report considered that a &ldquo;mechanism is needed to oversee the changes required of all those involved in the development of the new policing arrangements&rdquo;. It recommended that an oversight commissioner be appointed to fulfil this role. The Government considers that the appointment of an oversight commissioner is vital to the effective implementation of the report and has engaged in detailed discussions with the British authorities on the issue. An appointment to this key position is expected to be made in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals the Government has to promote reform of the United Nations, particularly in regard to the composition of the Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In the recent review of the action programme, the Government committed itself to support the strengthening of the capacity of the international community, in particular through the UN and the renewal process that will follow the millennium assembly, to make effective humanitarian interventions to halt conflict and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government. It was raised again by Ireland in the general debate in the UN General Assembly on 25 September 1999. While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian <Col N="153" /> assistance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the millennium summit and assembly later this year will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>
    <P>In March 1997 the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN development assistance framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will cooperate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
    <P>The track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary General and the creation of a new post of deputy secretary general with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the UN Secretary General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>In the course of my recent visit to the United Nations, which is the subject of an answer to another question, I had meetings with both Deputy Secretary General Frechette and the current President of the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia. During these meetings, I reiterated Ireland's support for the Secretary General's reform efforts.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the mainten<Col N="154" /> ance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group &ndash; open to all UN member states &ndash; to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the council for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has not yet been able to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 104, 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply disturbed by reports of the killings and abductions of United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, personnel and has condemned the actions taken by the Revolutionary United Front in direct violation of the Lomé Peace Agreement.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, we have called on the Revolutionary United Front, and in particular on its leader, Foday Sankoh, to cease all attacks against UNAMSIL, to release all detainees safely and unconditionally, and to implement fully their commitments under the Lomé Peace Agreement, including the implementation of the disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration programme. On 7 May, at our informal meeting in the Azores, EU Foreign Ministers recorded deepening concern at the return to conflict within Sierra Leone and at the escalating violence. The presidency was mandated to approach the Secretary General of the United Nations to express the full support of the EU for the Lomé Peace Agreement and the efforts of the UN to fulfil its mandate in Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>The latest developments call into question the progress achieved since the ceasefire agreed in July 1999 in Lomé and the UN Security Council Resolution of 7 February 2000 authorising the expansion of the UN mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL. We have consistently called on all parties to the agreement to fully implement its provisions, and to observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>
      <P>The Government and its EU partners are determined that UNAMSIL be given the support needed to fulfil the mandate given to it by the Security Council. We support the appeal of Secretary General Annan to the leaders of the region to redouble their efforts to bring the situation under control and we welcome the international efforts taken in recent days in support of the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1270 and 1289. The Government will continue to support efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone and at alleviating the suffering caused to the people there by the nine years of civil war in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the safety of Irish citizens, all but two of the citizens known to have been in Sierra Leone have left or been evacuated from the country. The two remaining are clergymen <Col N="156" /> who are reported safe in Kenema, some distance from Freetown.</P>

      <P>The Government fully shares the concern of the European Union about the fate of the hostages who were kidnapped on the Malaysian island of Sipadan on 23 April and are now being held by Muslim rebels on the Philippine island of Jolo.</P>
      <P>The matter was considered at length by me and my EU colleagues at our informal meeting last Sunday in the Azores. We strongly condemned this action and called on those responsible to release all the hostages immediately. The EU will spare no effort to secure their safety and early release. The EU supports the efforts of the Government of the Philippines to secure the safety of the hostages. The EU trusts that the Government of the Philippines will explore all possible avenues in order to resolve the matter peacefully and to avoid harm to the victims.</P>
      <P>The EU member states whose nationals are among the hostages have sent senior representatives to Manila to give appropriate assistance to the Government of the Philippines. The EU has also decided to send the High Representative of the European Union, Mr. Javier Solana, to the Philippines to convey personally to the Government there the EU's wish that every effort is made to secure the release of the hostages.</P>
      <P>We are fully aware of the pain and suffering caused by this cruel act not only to the hostages themselves but also to their families. I am sure that Members of this House will join me in expressing sympathy to all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland today concludes its chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which it assumed for a six month period in November 1999. The Committee of Ministers is the decision making body of the Council and the Government has regarded a successful term in office as a foreign policy priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political agenda of the Council has been dominated by the ongoing crisis in Chechnya. In my capacity as chairman in office of the Committee of Ministers, I have met the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ivanov, on a number of occasions recently and have taken the opportunity to express the concern of the Council and of the wider international community at the ongoing sit<Col N="157" /> uation in Chechnya. In particular, I urged Mr. Ivanov to respond positively to the concerns expressed by the Parliamentary Assembly in its recommendation 1456 of 6 April in relation to the setting up of an independent inquiry to investigate alleged human rights violations and war crimes in Chechnya, and the initiation of a political dialogue with representatives of the Chechen people.</P>
    <P>In Strasbourg, Ireland has worked to secure a consensus decision amongst the 41 states of the Council to instruct the Secretary General, in co-operation with Russia, to develop proposals for the Council of Europe contribution to resolving the crisis, in part on the basis of ideas advanced by the Commissioner for Human Rights following his visit in November. As a result, the Council of Europe is in the process of seconding personnel to the Kalamanov human rights mission in the region and is planning to hold a number of seminars on the development of democratic structures in the Caucasus region. For its part, Ireland has contributed £25,000 towards funding the Council of Europe involvement in this mission. These steps are intended as a response to the Parliamentary Assembly's Recommendation 1444 of 25 January, which called upon the Committee of Ministers to, <i>inter alia,</i> take steps in close co-operation with the Russian authorities to ensure a Council of Europe presence in the region and provide appropriate support to the Russian authorities for the implementation of peaceful policies in conformity with the norms and principles of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Another important issue during our term in office has been the development of the contribution of the Council of Europe to the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. The Council of Europe has an important role in the stability pact as a leading international organisation in the area of human rights and good governance. The Council has submitted a number of programmes and Ireland has indicated its interest in funding a project on the development of democratic citizenship and intercultural dialogue at local level. Ireland has pledged £500,000 over two years to this project.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe, with 41 member states, is, along with the European Union and the OSCE, one of the pre-eminent multilateral institutions in Europe. Within such a framework, it is important that there exist inter-institutional cohesion and co-operation in order that each organisation is in a position to fully discharge those responsibilities that it bears within a pan-European framework. It was with this in mind that we set out, prior to the beginning of our presidency, our desire for closer co-operation between the various organisations. In this regard, a ministerial level meeting between the Council of Europe, represented by the chairmanship and the Secretary General, and the EU, represented by Commissioner Patten and the Portuguese Presidency, was held on 14 March. In addition, Ireland, as chairman in office of the Committee <Col N="158" /> of Ministers, met with the Austrian chairman in office of the OSCE on 11 April, thus fulfilling its commitment that two such meetings should take place annually.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also achieved progress in our undertaking to develop relations between the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council. The President of the Assembly visited Dublin on 24-26 November and held meetings with my predecessor and the Taoiseach and addressed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Irish Chair also addressed the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly in Paris on 16 December. In addition, the spring meetings of the Parliamentary Assembly will take place in Dublin Castle next week. I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle, and to the members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly, in particular the leader of the delegation, Deputy Brendan Daly, for their initiative. Ireland's chairmanship has been greatly assisted by the efforts and support of the Oireachtas, many Members of which have participated in the work of the Council of Europe and, in particular, that of the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency programme involved a series of commitments regarding other areas of the Council's activities, including our bilateral involvement. The budget for 2000 was successfully adopted under the Irish chairmanship on 10 December. Despite zero growth in resources, we were able to provide, through re-allocations and reductions, the necessary additional funding for priority areas: the Court of Human Rights, the new Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights, the democratisation programmes and the assembly's monitoring activities.</P>
    <P>Bilateral efforts on Ireland's part include the dissemination of information about the role of Ireland within the Council of Europe through the distribution of an information booklet, Ireland and the Council of Europe; the publication of an academic text dealing with Ireland's early involvement with the Council, From Isolation towards Integration, which will be officially launched during the Parliamentary Assembly spring meetings in Dublin next week; Ireland's accession to the North-South Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity on 1 January 2000; the very successful European Conference on Social Development, hosted by my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, which took place in Dublin Castle on 17-18 January &ndash; work has since begun on a political communication from the Council of Europe addressed to the UN Special Session on Social Development in June 2000; the staging of an international human rights conference in Dublin on 3-4 March; and the ratification by Ireland of the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production.</P>

      <P>As of 30 April 2000, Ireland was owed approximately IR£7.1 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The only missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET. During 1999, the UN repaid arrears of approximately £5.5 million to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the monies owed. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations headquarters in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding monies is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day-<Col N="160" /> to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
    <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears would ease the situation considerably. The United States Administration has now tabled a plan, agreed with congress, to deal with the arrears problem which also contains proposals for reform of the UN financing system. This plan will be the subject of detailed negotiations at the United Nations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, will participate constructively in the process.</P>
    <P>A successful outcome to the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop contributing countries. In the meantime, I can assure the House that Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>
    <P>I have reported in an earlier reply on my discussions in New York on 24-25 April which included peacekeeping issues.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns raised about EU Food Aid, particularly the length of time it takes between a commitment to provide such aid and its arrival in the country in need. These concerns have been raised by Ireland and other member states at the EU's food aid committee. I have raised the particular case of Ethiopia with Commissioner Nielson and will do so again at the Development Council next week. The main concern expressed by the humanitarian organisations was the failure to replenish food drawn from the Ethiopian Government's emergency food security reserve &ndash; EFSR &ndash; in 1998 and 1999. The EFSR was created as a means of ensuring that sufficient food is in stock to address food shortages that may arise. Due to borrowings by NGOs and other agencies during the course of 1999 and the severity of the effects of three years of drought the reserve was depleted. These borrowings were made on foot of pledges from international donors such as the EU, USA and WFP that the stocks would be replenished.  However, there was a delay in fulfilling this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issue now is to ensure that the food aid committed for the current emergency reaches those most in need and then to build up the EFSR again. The European Commission has <Col N="161" /> pledged a total of 542,526 metric tonnes of food aid for delivery to Ethiopia over the next 12 months. Of this 109,647 metric tonnes will go to the EFSR.</P>
    <P>The EU's food aid committee will discuss Ethiopia's food aid requirements for 2001 in July with the aim of ensuring that the commitments for 2001 are delivered in the first months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Development Council at its forthcoming meeting on 18 May will examine the results of a number of evaluations of the EU aid programme. The council will also hear from Commissioner Nielson about the Commission's plans for the reform of the management of EU aid. The evaluations of EU aid have highlighted the complex internal financial controls, a centralised bureaucracy, a proliferation of different funding instruments and a lack of co-ordination between different Directorates in the Commission as impeding the effective delivery of EU aid. The commission, as part of its overall Commission reform programme, is planning a major overhaul of the management system of EU aid. It has also recently presented a Communication setting out an overall EU development policy which will govern all EU development programmes.</P>
    <P>In the coming months there will be intensive efforts by the Commission and the Council to deal with the internal problems in the EU aid system to ensure that its performance is improved and that aid is delivered effectively and speedily to those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its inception in 1991 the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, has publicly indicted 94 people. In addition, there are an unknown number of undisclosed indictments. Of those publicly indicted 18 have had all charges dropped and the indictment withdrawn, seven have died, one has been transferred to serve his sentence and one has been acquitted. Of the remaining 67, 40 are currently in proceedings before the court, 39 of whom are in the UN detention unit in The Hague and one has been provisionally released pending an appeal. Of the 39 currently in proceedings before the court and in detention, 12 have lodged an appeal against sentence, six are in ongoing trials and 16 are on remand awaiting appearance before the ICTY.</P>
      <P>Of those indicted, 37 have been charged with grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Convention, 65 with violations of the laws or customs of war, nine with genocide, 58 with crimes against humanity and 19 with sexual offences. Some of the 94 indicted have been charged with more than one offence, which accounts for the discrepancy in charges as opposed to numbers of indicted.</P>
      <P>Fifteen sentences of imprisonment ranging from six to 45 years have been handed down by ICTY. The longest sentence of 45 years was imposed on Tihomir Blaskic, a Croatian, for three counts of crimes against humanity, six counts of grave breaches of the Geneva Convention and ten counts of violations of the laws and customs of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may regard the figures I have just given as being unimpressive given the length of time ICTY has been in existence. I would, however, point out that ICTY has by no means finished its work. Investigations are still proceeding in the field and it is likely that many more indictments will be issued followed by arrests and transfer to The Hague for trial. I would point out that, of cases which been brought before ICTY, the vast majority result in a conviction and sentence of imprisonment. Acquittals are very few. This bears witness to the painstaking investigations carried out under the direction of the ICTY prosecutor, Justice Carla del Ponte, Switzerland, since September 1999, and her predecessor Justice Louse Arbour, Canada. The painstaking nature of the investigations and the obvious concern that justice be done and seen to <Col N="163" /> be done, contributes in my view to the credibility of the court.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported the court since its inception and will continue to do so for as long as it continues to do its work. I am concerned, however, at the number of accused who are still at large. This amounts to 27 and includes among their number some such notorious people as Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who are wanted for their role in the Bosnian war, including the massacre at Srebrenica. It also includes President Slobodan Milosevic and his immediate associates.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the UN Transition Administration in East Timor, UNTAET, which was established by UN Security Council Resolution 1272 on 25 October 1999, will administer the territory for an indefinite period, probably two or three years. It has a comprehensive mandate to provide security and maintain law and order throughout the territory of East Timor, to establish an effective administration, to assist in the development of civil and social services, to ensure the co-ordination and delivery of humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and development assistance, to support capacity building for self-government and to assist in the establishment of conditions for sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In November of last year a joint needs assessment mission, consisting of the UN agencies, World Bank and IMF, European Commission, some major donors and representatives of the East Timorese people, completed an assessment visit to East Timor. Their findings provided the basis for a donor pledging conference that took place in December. At that meeting the European Commission pledged new funding for reconstruction in East Timor of at least 60 million euro over the next three years. These funds were in addition to 35 million euro given for humanitarian aid which was extended for the duration of the emergency and channeled through ECHO &ndash; the humanitarian office of the European Commission. The vast majority of European Commission funding is channelled through a common trust fund which allows for a flexible allocation of funds.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows Ireland and other individual EU member states are individually making contributions to the UN mission UNTAET.</P>

      <P>The main tasks currently facing the OSCE are the follow up to the Charter for European Security, ongoing efforts to establish lasting peace in Chechnya and consolidation of peace in the Balkans.</P>
      <P>The OSCE Istanbul Summit last November adopted a substantive Charter for European Security. The charter builds on existing OSCE documents, notably the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter, and will enhance the OSCE's ability to play an active part in support of democracy and stability. Among the concrete measures in the charter was the decision to create rapid expert assistance and co-operation teams, known as REACT, thereby enabling the OSCE to respond quickly to demands for assistance and for large civilian field operations. In consultation with participating states, an OSCE task force has been established which is preparing the necessary measures in order to make REACT operational.</P>
      <P>In the case of Chechnya, it has been agreed, following the visit to the area by the chairman in office, Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero Waldner, that the OSCE assistance group will return to the region, if possible by the end of May. In addition the OSCE has placed 62 monitors on the border between Georgia and Chechnya with the aim of preventing any conflict spillover.</P>
      <P>In the Balkans, the mission in Kosovo, which is the organisation's largest mission, has a major role in encouraging inter ethnic co-operation and in the preparation for elections to take place later this year, possibly in October. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the second largest OSCE mission, the mission supervised the local municipal elections which took place in April and is preparing to monitor the parliamentary elections scheduled to be held later this year. The mission in Croatia is actively engaged in seeking to facilitate the return of refugees and in providing professional expertise to the ethnically mixed local police force in the Croatian Danube region.  </P>
      <P>In addition to these missions, the OSCE has teams assigned to Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and each of the five Central Asian States. The main thrust of these Missions is to assist in the development of democracy, the promotion of human rights and encouragement of respect for the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, is active in promoting free and fair elections and the High Commissioner on National Minorities, HCNM, closely monitors the issue of minority rights.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the continuing violence in Zimbabwe and the breakdown in the rule of law, illegal occupations, threats, intimidation, damage to property and tragic loss of life that have occurred since the early part of this year. Together with our EU partners, we have expressed our concern at the situation to the Government of Zimbabwe on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>We have appealed to the Government to ensure respect for the law, and to maintain public order and civil protection. Recalling the fundamental importance of respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, we have called on the Government to respect international law and standards.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, we have reiterated our commitment to orderly and transparent agrarian reform which respects the rights of all citizens and is compatible with the economic development requirements of the country. We have also stated our support for land resettlement within the rule of law and on the basis of principles and conclusions of the 1998 Land Reform and Resettlement Conference. At the same time, we have condemned the illegal occupation of farms, which seriously undermines the right of ownership and the freedoms guaranteed by the constitution.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to parliamentary elections this year, we have urged the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that fair elections, free of intimidation, are held within the timetable prescribed by the constitution. We have welcomed the willingness of the Government to accept international election observers, and with other EU member states, will be ready to send such a team subject to satisfactory freedom of access and security.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to support all efforts to resolve the current situation by peaceful means.</P>

      <P>Rosemary Nelson was brutally murdered in a car bomb attack in Lurgan on 15 March 1999. This murder was an attack on a dedicated and committed defence lawyer and human rights defender and also represented a fundamental assault on the legal system itself.</P>
      <P>On 29 March 1999, the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, Colin Port, was appointed to lead the investigation into her murder. That investigation is still ongoing.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly emphasised that the investigation into Rosemary Nelson's murder must be thorough, transparent and independent, and be seen to be so. Furthermore, it should be completed in the most expeditious manner possible. Once again, we would urge all those with relevant information to assist the investigation in every appropriate way.</P>
      <P>We continue to monitor closely the progress of the investigation, including in relation to allegations of collusion.

      <P>I do not believe an examination of introducing a system of controls on the start up of new businesses is justified. A general licensing system of this type would not be conducive to the promotion of new enterprises and the generation of new employment opportunities in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The recent EU summit in Lisbon identified a number of practical measures aimed at promoting small companies as the main engine of job creation. The EU Commission SLIM initiative launched in May 1996 is simplifying internal market legislation with the aim of enabling business, including start up companies, to operate more efficiently and more effectively.</P>
      <P>There are specific and precise legislative requirements, for example, health, safety and financial capacity, which must be complied with if a person wishes to carry on business in specified sectors of activity. For example, in the insurance sector, new companies wishing to transact either non-life insurance or life assurance business must have an authorisation from myself. Companies wishing to avail of limited liability under the Companies Acts must comply with a number of statutory obligations.</P>
      <P>On the question of consumer protection, there is an extensive and wide-ranging body of legislation applying to both goods and services.</P>
      <P>All legislative requirements are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure they continue to be relevant.</P>

    <P>During 1999, 19,250 jobs were lost in firms that had at some stage received grant support. Certain agency clients do not receive grant aid, for example, those located in the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>While job losses are regrettable and are not always avoidable, they must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy. Significant employment creation continued unabated in the wider economy during 1999, as indicated by the latest quarterly national household survey. In the September-November quarter of 1999 there were an additional 102,700 in employment compared with the same period in 1998. Furthermore the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 1999 compared with 6.4% in the same period in 1998. During 2000 the unemployment rate has declined further and is now estimated to be about 4.7%.</P>
    <P>One objective of enterprise policy is to constrain job losses as far as possible by helping indigenous companies achieve stronger positions of durable competitive advantage and by encouraging investment in greater research and development, market driven innovation, human resource development and skills improvement. With regard to foreign investment in the economy, IDA Ireland is encouraging foreign companies that have plants here to become more deeply embedded in the economy while targeting new investments in products and services which involve higher technologies and skills. These measures are a core aspect of the development agencies' mission and underpin important programmes, which help to ensure firms' prospects of longevity and ultimately the sustainability of longer term employment for their workforces.</P>
    <P>Enterprise development policies will continue to help firms which have the capacity for growth <Col N="170" /> so that they can become more resilient to the competitive pressures that can lead to job losses.</P>

      <P>In its statement on 6 May, the IRA repeated that there is no threat to the peace process from it and it looked forward to a context in which political objectives can be pursued peacefully. It also identified the context in which the IRA will completely and verifiably put its arms beyond use and said that its guns are silent and secure. As a confidence building measure, the IRA agreed to the regular inspection by agreed third parties &ndash; who will report to the independent international commission on decommissioning &ndash; of a number of its arms dumps to confirm the security of its weapons. This process will now be taken forward by the commission, together with Mr. Maarti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa who have agreed to head the inspections.</P>

      <P>There is a total of 241 Kosovar refugees accommodated in mobile homes in Magee Barracks in Kildare town.</P>
      <P>The evacuation programme in 1999 for Kosovar refugees was always seen as a temporary measure. The refugees were given permission to remain in Ireland for one year. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has now indicated that, for the vast majority of Kosovar refugees, there is no longer a need for temporary protection in host countries. The programme will, therefore, be gradually wound down and returning refugees will receive assistance to help them start the process of rebuilding their lives in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>The Government expects most refugees to return to Kosovo over the next few months. However, it is recognised that there may be individual cases of vulnerable refugees who may require protection for a further temporary period. Such cases will be looked at sympathetically by Government. It is intended that, where refugees are given permission to remain for a further temporary period, they will move out of the existing reception centres into private rented accommodation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 103, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated to the House on several occasions, most recently in my reply of 23 March, the systematic violation of human rights in Burma is a matter of profound concern to the Government and to the EU. The continuing refusal of the military regime to respect the results of the democratic elections which were held there, or to address the findings of various UN and other inquiries, means that the situation remains unacceptable. The regime has, moreover, failed to act on the recommendations of a number of resolutions adopted by both the Commission on Human Rights, including as recently as last month, and by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and the EU strongly hold the view that progress will be made only when the military regime enters into meaningful dialogue with <Col N="173" /> Madam Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy. The EU has sought to persuade the Burmese military regime to engage in dialogue with the National League for Democracy by suggesting initial practical steps and confidence building measures. To date, however, the response of the regime has been disappointing.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing failure of the regime to enter into dialogue with the democratic movement, and the ongoing unsatisfactory situation there, my EU colleagues and I, at our meeting on 10 April, decided to extend for a further period and to strengthen the EU Common Position on Burma, adopted during the Irish Presidency in 1996, which imposes restrictive measures on the military regime. In doing so, we expressed concern at the continuing and intensified repression of civil and political rights, as well as the harsh conditions hindering the people's enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. We once again urged the Burmese authorities to respect human rights, restore democracy and engage in a dialogue with the opposition that could lead to national reconciliation in a united and democratic State.</P>
    <P>The additional measures agreed on to strengthen the common position are as follows: a ban on the export of equipment that might be used for internal repression or terrorism; a strengthening of the current visa ban on senior officials of the military regime, their family members and supporters as well as publication of the names of the persons concerned; and a freeze on the funds held abroad by those same persons.</P>
    <P>It was also decided to make a further effort to explain and to promote the aims of the EU's policy towards Burma/Myanmar through the establishment of a meaningful political dialogue. To that end, the EU intends to send a second Troika mission to Rangoon. In addition, in an effort to alleviate the hardship being suffered by the Burmese people, the Commission has been invited to examine the possibilities for increased humanitarian aid to Burma.</P>
    <P>The situation in Burma, and the effect of the strengthened restrictive measures, will be kept under close review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of measures are in place to encourage the transfer of land to young trained farmers. Since the introduction of the early retirement scheme in 1994 and up to 31 December 1999, 9,973 farmers have availed of the scheme and almost 300,000 hectares of land have been released. Proposals for a new scheme have been submitted to the European Commission as part of my Department's draft rural development plan for the period 2000-06 and it is expected that a high level of take-up will continue.</P>
      <P>The national scheme of installation aid introduced in December 1998 provides young trained farmers with a grant of £5,600 to assist them with the cost of the farm transfer. Under the national development plan 2000-06, a new scheme is provided for and a higher rate of grant of £7,500 will apply under the proposed scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the schemes of early retirement and installation aid, a range of tax incentives are in place to assist young farmers and to encourage the transfer of land to them. These include: 100% stock relief for young trained farmers; reduced stamp duty; 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax; income tax exemptions for land leased by farmers over 55 to non-connected persons; retirement relief on capital gains tax for <Col N="175" /> farmers over 55; 30% reduction in the market value of agricultural property when computing probate tax.</P>
    <P>Following the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness stamp duty relief for young trained farmers has been extended from two thirds to full relief.</P>

      <P>The person named was one of a number of herdowners selected to be audited in respect of his area aid application. This audit has now been completed and the area aid application has been fully processed.</P>
      <P>The person named claimed a total of 22.36 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 20.66 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.70 hectares or 8.22% between the area claimed and that determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. In this case, therefore, a penalty of 3.40 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 17.26 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entitlements of the person named under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and the 1999 cattle headage scheme were calculated on the basis of his original declaration of 22.36 hectares and the person named was paid £520 under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and £950.28 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 18 October 1999. A recalculation of his entitlements under these schemes, based on the revised area of 17.26 hectares, shows that he has been overpaid by the amount of £230.86. This is in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the headage schemes which provide that an applicant qualify<Col N="177" /> ing for disadvantaged areas beef cow and sheep headage grants may not receive more than £89.62 per hectare of the total forage area and not more than £55.99 per forage hectare in respect of other headage grants subject to an overall stocking rate of 1.4 livestock units per forage hectare. The amount of £230.86 will be recouped from his next payment entitlements under the headage-premia schemes.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium in respect of a total of 66 animals in 1999. The first application received by my Department on 18 January 1999 was in respect of 65 animals. Premium had previously been paid in respect of one animal on this application. At an on-farm inspection it was found that a further animal was not in the applicant's ownership at the time of application. This resulted in the animal in question also being rejected from the application with a consequent reduced payment on the remaining eligible animals. When the inspection results were processed further errors were discovered which have now been resolved and payment will issue within the next ten days.</P>
      <P>A second application in respect of one animal has been fully paid. The final balancing payment issued on 30 April 2000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water <Col N="181" /> fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>A side effect of too much fluoride ingested in early childhood while teeth are forming is dental fluorosis. This effect was always known and was accepted as a trade off against the dental benefits. The period of maximum risk is two to five years of age. Drinking fluoridated water within the range 0.8 &ndash; 1.0ppm gives rise to a very small percentage of the population having fluorosis of a mild to a very mild category. This type of fluorosis is almost invisible to the untrained eye.</P>
      <P>The statutory dosing parameter for fluoride is the level at which the greatest protection against dental decay is achieved while at the same time minimising the risk of fluorosis.</P>
      <P>The greatest risk factor for fluorosis in children is their frequent swallowing of amounts of fluoride toothpaste greater than the size of a pea.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation estimates that approximately 210 million people in 39 countries benefit from artificially fluoridated water. An additional 40 million people benefit from water supply which is naturally fluoridated.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, has awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, to advise health boards on an up-to-date status report on all aspects relating to fluoride use including water fluoridation. When advice and recommendations are available from these studies appropriate consultation will take place to inform future policy on fluoride use for this country.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to issue new guidelines until this work is complete. However, I do intend to promote more widely the correct usage of fluoride toothpaste.</P>

      <P>The budget for nursing home subvention in 1998 was £24 million, £33 million in 1999 and the allocation for 2000 is £38.4 million. There are currently approximately 6,095 persons in receipt of nursing home subventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. Considerable <Col N="182" /> additional resources have been allocated to this scheme in recent years. For example, in the current year additional funding of £5.4 million has been provided to meet the cost of the additional expenditure which is due to a number of factors. These include the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Health Research Board &ndash; HRB &ndash; is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland. Its functions are to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health, and health services research and such epidemiological research as may appropriately be carried out at national level, to assist and support other health agencies in promoting or conducting epidemiological research and to liaise and co-operate with other research bodies in Ireland or elsewhere in promoting, commissioning or conducting relevant research. The provision of funding for science and health research is, in the first instance, a matter for the HRB.</P>
      <P>This Government has made a significant commitment to the Health Research Board and this is shown by the significant increase in funding since 1997. As part of my commitment to ensuring that the HRB is properly resourced, I provided additional funding of £2 million which will increase its allocation this year to £9.503 million. This is approximately 2.5 times the 1997 original budget of £3.835 million and demonstrates the importance this Government attaches to the role of health research in achieving health and social gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a wide ranging consultation process and a recently held successful conference with interested parties the HRB is currently in the process of finalising the national strategy for health research. The issue of specific national lottery funding has been raised in submissions made in relation to this strategy and will be considered in the light of the overall strategy. It is expected that <Col N="183" /> a definitive strategy for health research will be completed by July 2000.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of funding from my Department's allocation of national lottery funds generally, applications are received primarily from individuals, groups and agencies involved in the provision of health services to specific client groups. Each application is then considered in the context of the recommendation from the relevant service division and the overall level of funds available.

      <Quest>if the orthodontic treatment service for children has collapsed in the Dublin region in view of the fact that parents have been informed that no new patients have been treated this year; and the steps he will take to deal with the four and five year backlogs of children awaiting treatment.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>Difficulties were encountered in the latter part of 1999 and early 2000 in the regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital which caused the cancellation of routine orthodontic appointments. These difficulties have been resolved and an action plan is being implemented to address the needs of all affected patients.</P>
      <P>Developments currently under way in relation to the orthodontic services include: the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists, the recruitment of a number of dentists with orthodontic qualifications, the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown and the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at Beaumont Hospital.</P>

      <P>Data on procedures are available from the hospital in-patient inquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system which records information on hospitalisations in all publicly funded acute hospitals. The data available in respect of 1994 to 1999 are set out in Table 1. Prior to 1994 the system was not sufficiently comprehensive to report national totals reliably.</P>
      <P>The data in Table 3 are taken from the annual health service personnel census. The latest year available is 1998. The 1999 census is in the process of being collected and collated.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme provides a treatment and curative service for medical card patients, including the provision of normal sickness certificates. The scheme does not extend to the issue of certificates relating to such matters as driving licences, insurance or assurance policies. Accordingly, a general practitioner may charge such fees for such certificates as he or she feels is reasonable. If an individual feels that he or she is being overcharged for any certificate, they should raise the matter with the general practitioner and seek an explanation for the charge.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below to the extent that it is available. The present basic structure of the health services was established in 1971 with the setting up of the health boards. Prior to that time, the local authorities were responsible for the health services and reliable information regarding numbers employed is not available.</P>
      <P>The information available to my Department is obtained from the health service personnel census. The most recent year for which the data is available is 1998. The census for 1999 is currently being collected.</P>

    <P>Note: The figures refer to wholetime equivalents rather than actual number of employees. They are based on returns by individual agencies. Earlier figures &ndash; 1997 and 1981 &ndash; are considered less reliable due to variations among agencies in their approach to counting part-time staff, locums, etc. Methodology has been refined in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>There were no detailed staffing statistics for 1981 in respect of mental handicap services and commercial/non-commercial State bodies. However, the total employment at the date of the staff embargo was, as shown, 66,060.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1991 the inclusion in the health service personnel census of employment in commercial and non-commercial State boards under the aegis of the Department ceased. The decline in employment in the health service during the 1980s reflects the effect of the overall drive to reduce public service numbers in that period and, in particular, the early retirement scheme. The growth in employment since the 1980s follows significant investment in and expansion of the level and type of health and personal social services.</P>

      <P>Information available to my Department indicates that at the end of December 1998 some 3,100 local authority dwellings were vacant. A large number of these vacant dwellings comprise flats in the Dublin Corporation area which have been detenanted prior to future demolition <Col N="188" /> in such areas as Ballymun and St. Michael's Estate and major renovations in various inner city flats complexes.</P>
      <P>The figures available to my Department suggest that normally, apart from major renovation projects, about 1% of local authority dwellings are vacant at any time. This is largely due to the fact that dwellings becoming vacant usually require renovations/improvements to be undertaken before being relet. I would encourage local authorities to ensure that once a dwelling becomes vacant it is relet as quickly as possible to a household on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>According to the assessment of local authority housing needs undertaken in March 1999 the numbers of households on the housing lists for Midleton, Youghal and Cobh Urban District Councils were 173, 165 and 164 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Government is giving a particularly high priority to the issue of housing. This is reflected in the new national development plan which makes provision for the construction of 35,500 local authority houses over the seven years of the plan.</P>
      <P>Under the multi-annual housing programme a total of 22,000 housing starts have been approved for the four years 2000-03. This works out at an average of 5,500 housing starts per year, which is the highest number for years. The Urban District Councils of Midleton, Youghal and Cobh have been allocated 70, 80 and 70 housing starts respectively for the four years 2000-03. This will allow the local authorities to plan their housing programmes in advance over a four year period rather than on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>In addition to the construction/acquisition of houses, the Urban District Councils of Midleton, Youghal and Cobh will also be able to use vacancies arising in existing local authority housing and output under other social housing measures to meet the needs of households on the waiting lists. For example, a voluntary housing scheme is in the process of being completed by St. Pancras voluntary housing association at Beechwood, Youghal Road, and this will cater for 38 households on the Midleton housing list.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the manager to ensure that staffing levels in the local authority are adequate to carry out the functions of the local authority.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the need to ensure that local authorities have sufficient staff to deal with their substantial work programmes and all requests for sanction to create additional posts are dealt with on this basis by my Department. In this context, I would point out that 138 additional technical planning posts alone have been sanctioned since July 1998.</P>
      <P>My Department's sanction is not required for the engagement of consultants to carry out planning work and we have no information on the extent to which work is contracted out in this way. However, we are aware that many local authorities use consultants to prepare the draft development plans and local area plans.</P>
      <P>The cost of operating the planning service is funded out of the local authorities' general funds and the fees received with applications for planning permissions. Planning fee income is continuing to rise as a result of the increase in fees granted in 1998 and from large increases in applications. Planning authorities have been advised to use this increase in income to fund additional staff.</P>

      <P>Waiting days have been a feature of the disability benefit scheme since its inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.</P>
      <P>It can reasonably be expected that most workers would be able to absorb the loss of the first three days earnings without suffering undue hardship. As many employers have occupational sick pay arrangements which provide compensation for employees for short spells of incapacity, the waiting day rule also serves to reduce the overlap between State and occupational sick pay provision. However, where a person has a subsequent spell of incapacity in quick succession or has been claiming an unemployment payment immediately before becoming ill, then the three waiting day rule is waived.</P>
      <P>It is also the case that the application of a three waiting day period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs which would be involved in processing large numbers of disability benefit claims of a very short duration.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that workers are not generally left without any financial support during the three waiting day period. Where a person has no recourse to occupational sick pay and has no other income, supplementary welfare allowance can be paid.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans at present to amend the three day waiting period for disability benefit purposes, my Department will continue to keep the operation of this rule under review.</P>

His spouse subsequently qualified for old age non-contributory pension in her own right in 1995. In August 1996 both pensions were terminated as the persons concerned moved to live in England.</P>
      <P>In August 1997 they re-applied for pension. These applications were refused as the deciding officer was not satisfied in the case of either applicant that their capital means from the sale of property had been fully disclosed. The decision to refuse pension was upheld on appeal by the people concerned to the independent social welfare appeals office. A subsequent application for pension by the couple in 1999 was refused on the same non-disclosure grounds, again upheld on appeal.</P>

      <P>The rates of child dependant allowances &ndash; CDAs &ndash; payable to claimants of the widow's-widower's contributory pension and the widow's-widower's non-contributory pension are currently set at £17 per week and £15.20 per week respectively. These rates, as with all other CDA payments, have remained unchanged since 1994.</P>
      <P>Recognising that the loss of CDAs by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up work opportunities, successive Governments have, in the intervening period, instead pursued a policy which seeks to make child income support more neutral <i>vis-a-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s) by concentrating resources for child income support on child benefit.</P>
      <P>The employment disincentive problems associated with CDAs were highlighted particularly in the report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Unlike CDAs, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test. The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million in the scheme, while the 2000 budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, which will bring the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million.</P>
      <P>The policy of concentrating substantial additional resources on child benefit rather than increasing CDAs remains, in my view, as valid now as it was when it was initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of gross average industrial earnings is estimated to have risen by some 19.5% in the period from 1994 to 1999. More pertinently, the consumer price index rose by almost 10% in the same period. The value of the combined child benefit-CDA payment for a family with four chil<Col N="193" /> dren increased by more than 22% over that period or by more than double the rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>Following the launch of the Grand Canal corridor study in July 1994, a task force was established to oversee the implementation of improvements along the canal system in the Dublin area. Advances have been made in a number of areas including the establishment of community employment schemes with a focus on canal improvements in Clondalkin and Ballyfermot. Under these schemes site clearance and landscaping improvement works have been undertaken along the canal system in these areas. The waterways division of my Department has also carried out a major tree planting programme in the Inchicore and Dolphin's Barn areas. Waterways has also replaced lock gates in Dublin area, and has also undertaken some dredging works on the main line. Fish stocking has been carried out on the system in association with the Central Fisheries Board and local angling groups.</P>

      <P>The process of developing a transaction structure to establish a digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; entity is ongoing. As I have indicated to the House, difficulties have arisen in the complex process of establishing a DTT entity as originally envisaged. I have been forced to consider alternative <Col N="194" /> approaches with a view to moving the project forward in a manner most likely to achieve the successful introduction of the DTT platform. Consultations on these options are ongoing and, if and when I decide that it is necessary to bring proposals to Government to progress the matter further, I will do so.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department to co-ordinate the sourcing of suitable accommodation for asylum seekers and their resettlement at locations throughout the country. Prior to this, most asylum seekers had been accommodated in Dublin. However, due to the acute shortage of accommodation in the capital, the Government decided that newly arrived asylum seekers should be dispersed throughout the country. Advertisements were placed in the media inviting offers of suitable accommodation.</P>
      <P>Arising from these advertisements, the directorate has entered into contractual agreements for the provision of accommodation in various hotels, guest houses and hostels around the country and assessment of the suitability of offers is ongoing. The Office of Public Works has also purchased and leased certain properties on behalf of the directorate for the provision of full-board accommodation to asylum seekers and has identified a number of public sector sites suitable for development under the accommodation programme for asylum seekers. In addition, the directorate has recently placed advertisements seeking offers of suitable sites in the private sector. In the longer term, my aim is to achieve a fair and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country and to resettle asylum seekers having regard to the size of local communities.</P>
      <P>As indicated above, the directorate is still assessing the potential of accommodation offers and sites around the country. In line with normal practice, I do not propose to release details of these until such time as the arrangements in relation to them have been agreed, the relevant formalities concluded and local communities have been informed. The table below gives a breakdown of the counties outside Dublin to which asylum seekers have been dispersed to date, the number of accommodation centres in each county and their total capacity.</P>

This project is one of ten to be set up in both rural and urban areas in the first phase of the expansion of Garda youth diversion programme funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>Full year funding of up to £60,000 will be provided for the Bawnogue, Clondalkin project. It will employ one full-time co-ordinator, whose initial task will be to research the services currently provided for young people in the area with a view to ascertaining the appropriate numbers of young people who might benefit from involvement in such a project. Approximately 20 young people will be engaged in the core project programmes at any given time.</P>
      <P>The project will be overseen by a management advisory committee comprising of garda, the probation and welfare service, the Catholic Youth Council, local residents, teen counselling, home-school liaison teacher and Obair, the local employment training group.</P>
      <P>The project will be based at the Bawnogue community centre, and it's catchment area will be Bawnogue, Deansrath and Dunawley in south-west Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>In common with other projects, it will be required to prepare an annual report of activities/programmes, as well as audited accounts for each year. The operation of all projects will be reviewed from time to time.</P>

Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. I should also mention that the age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test.

    <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the <Col N="198" /> conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. This includes a PSV licence, certificate of roadworthiness, certificate of insurance and tax disc. Drivers must have a valid driving licence for the class of vehicle to be driven. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts. Vehicles must be kept clean internally and externally to the satisfaction of Bus Éireann. Contractor's vehicles are subject to inspection/testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>

      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the establishment of such a special class in north Cork.</P>
      <P>Such special classes are established where a need has been identified and supported by up-to-date psychological and speech therapy reports in respect of the children in question.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the delay in approving career breaks for secondary school teachers; the reason applications lodged cannot be approved this summer; if his attention has been drawn to the problems it causes with timetabling and recruitment when such applications are not approved until September; and if he will now approve an application for a person (details supplied) in County Dublin.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision as to whether an application from a secondary school teacher for a career break should be granted is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned. The closing date for receipt of such applications is 1 March prior to the commencement of the school year in which the teacher wishes to go on career break.</P>
      <P>Where the school authorities approve an application for a career break, the school may appoint a temporary replacement for the teacher concerned if the school is within quota. If the school is over quota, the school authorities must apply to my Department for permission to appoint a replacement teacher. Each such case is considered on its merits and the school authorities are advised of the decision as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand that the application for a career break submitted by the teacher referred to by the Deputy has been turned down by the board of management of the school concerned.</P>
