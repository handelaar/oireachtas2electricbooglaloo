      <P>Today's Order of Business shall be as follows: item 5, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; item 41, Statements on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (resumed), to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of Matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inquire from the Minister on two related issues. Will there be a debate in this House on the national plan in view of the revisions being contemplated of much greater investment in rail than was originally provided for? Will there be amendments to the Light Rail Act to facilitate this? My understanding of the national plan is that it provides £500 million for additional rail projects to be selected over those already committed. The announcements in today's newspapers would cost in the region of £2,000 million or more, which is approximately four times greater than is provided for in the plan. Will the financial projections in the plan be revised to take account of the proposed major underground rail link which is much more extensive than was originally envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These are additional proposals which, if adopted, will be additional to the Luas proposals. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is aware that the Luas proposals are progressing. Studies are in progress and it is expected there will be a report to the sub-committee early in April followed by a report to Cabinet for consideration. Therefore, the proposals are at a very early stage. The initial idea foresaw that kind of development out to Mulhuddart and Dublin Airport as being necessary in the longer term. There will be an opportunity to discuss what is happening under the Programme for Prosperity and <Col N="286" /> Fairness. We have already had a number of discussions. If and when proposals are put forward, there will be an opportunity to discuss them at that stage because it is very much a matter of medium to long-term planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle allowing me to ask these questions. Will revised financial projections to take account of any amendments be published? There is no point debating ideas in the abstract without having figures indicating what will suffer if something else has to be cut to provide for this and where the additional money will come from. We need financial projections in order to have a meaningful discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to project what may be necessary in this regard. Obviously there will be major financial considerations but these will depend on the methods and proposals involved. As soon as the measures have been considered by Government, discussions can begin. Deputy Bruton will recognise we must look to the medium and longer term and that there must be a dedicated proposal in relation to routes to Mulhuddart and Dublin Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Education and Science take this opportunity to dissociate the Government from the remarks of the Minister for Finance last night calling backbenchers who support the Government and the Irish League of Credit Unions hypocrites and those who supported the amendments tabled by them evaders of tax? Is that the Government's view of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the backbenchers who support the Government or was it simply another solo run by the Minister for Finance? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that, in the absence of a denial, we can assume the attack on Government <Col N="287" /> backbenchers, on the Independents and on the League of Credit Unions is the attitude of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the White Paper on Defence and something which causes all of us in this House concern in relation to employment in Harland and Wolff, will the Government consider the commitment in the White Paper to look at vessel replacement? Will it positively consider Harland and Wolff as a possible location to provide the replacements for the fleet envisaged in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to co-operate as far as possible with our colleagues in Northern Ireland. We have done so in relation to research in oil and gas structures, platforms and so on. The Deputy can rest assured that Harland and Wolff will be given an opportunity to become involved in any projects because they will be widely advertised.</P>
      <P>Further discussions will take place between the credit unions and the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste when Brussels gives its decision. That is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking no chances this morning, I am staying on my feet. May I ask the Minister about promised legislation? Yesterday I asked about the registration of births, deaths and marriages legislation which is promised in the Government programme. Given that there are now a number of Garda inquiries into the integrity of the births, deaths and marriages registers, will the Minister bring forward the date of the legislation, which he said yesterday would be 2001, and bring in an immediate Bill to make amendments to the 1863 Act which covers the registration of births, deaths and marriages. It is clear there is&mdash;</P>

      <P>Something immediate has been done in the Finance Bill to allow for the exchange of the information which would be necessary. There is also a major £8 million, approximately, Grow project, a computerisation system, in co-operation between the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Health and Children. That will help with the questions raised by people in relation to this particular incident. That is the practical side of it. So far as the legislation is concerned&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend to the House the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, which pro<Col N="292" /> vides for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable the Oireachtas to put in place one of the key measures relating to abuse of children in institutions announced last May by the Taoiseach. Through the Commission individual victims will be given an opportunity to overcome the lasting effects of abuse. The past failures of our society in allowing child abuse in institutions will be acknowledged. The facts of abuse, however unpalatable, will be brought into the open so that we can confront the truth, and the lessons taught by past failures will be well learned to protect the children of the future.</P>
    <P>Our desire that the truth of past child abuse be clearly established is a primary motivating factor for this Bill. Nevertheless, we should avoid a witch hunt. Our objective is to establish all of the circumstances, the good and the bad, relating to the operation, management and regulation of institutions which cared for children. The Commission, therefore, will also give an opportunity for the many people who devoted their lives and their energies to the protection and welfare of children in institutions to have their say so that their contribution can be acknowledged and distinguished from the abuse committed by others. It is important that the commission be in a position to reflect this reality of the institutions also in the interests of establishing a full and balanced picture of what occurred.</P>
    <P>The scourge of child abuse is an international phenomenon. Of those countries with which we share a common basis for our legal system, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand all have had a similar experience to ours, as have many of our EU partners. If we, as a society differ from other societies, it is in the fact that we appear to have reacted more slowly in addressing the issue of abuse which occurred in the past. The time for action is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired by the Hon. Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, was established by the Government on an administrative basis last May. This was part of a range of measures to address the effect of abuse in childhood on the victims. The first objective set for the commission was to consider the broad terms of reference then provided to it, determine if these needed refining and recommend to Government the powers and protections it would need to do its work effectively. The commission reported to the Government in September and October. Its recommendations have been accepted without reservation by the Government and this Bill follows closely the recommendations in the reports.</P>
    <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, now to be established under law, will have three primary functions. First, to listen to victims of childhood abuse who want to recount their experiences to a sympathetic forum; second, to investigate all allegations of abuse made to it, except where the victim does not wish for an <Col N="293" /> investigation and third, to publish a report on its findings to the general public.</P>
    <P>A forum where they can recount their experiences has long been a demand of those who were residents of industrial schools, reformatory schools, orphanages and similar places. For many of those who suffered abuse in those institutions and in other places, the need to tell about it and to be listened to in a sympathetic and open minded way is an urgent one and is the beginning for them of recovery. Up to the very recent past, victims of abuse have been largely dismissed or ignored by Irish society, its institutions and its representatives. However, ignoring this issue is not an option the Government is prepared to take and hence the provisions of this Bill. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to be established under this Bill will, as its core function, provide those who have been silenced for so long with an opportunity to give their account to an experienced and sympathetic forum. This telling and listening function, which can be called the therapeutic function of the commission or the healing forum, is the function to which everything else should be subordinate.</P>
    <P>For some people, this therapeutic role will be all they require of the commission. Others will also seek that their allegations be inquired into and perpetrators of abuse, where uncovered, be brought to justice. In this case the therapeutic role will have grafted onto it an investigative role in the interests of establishing the truth and giving persons against whom allegations are made an opportunity to defend themselves. To ensure that the two strands can be accommodated, the Bill provides for two committees, the confidential commttee and the investigation committee. This will ensure, on the one hand, the right to confidentiality for those who want only to access the therapeutic role of the commission and, on the other, rights to natural justice of persons accused of abuse.</P>
    <P>Through the confidential committee, the commission will provide a forum for victims of abuse to recount their experience on an entirely confidential basis. The purpose of this commitee is overwhelmingly therapeutic. It is intended that it will meet the needs of those victims who want to speak of their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure. Because of this limited though vitally important remit, this committee will also be limited in the extent to which it can draw conclusions from the evidence it receives. This committee will provide the commission with a report on its proceedings. This report, however, will confine itself to findings of a general nature on the issues encountered in its work.</P>
    <P>The investigation committee will also provide an opportunity for victims to tell of the abuse they suffered as one of its core functions but it will go much further than that. The committee will be specifically mandated to carry out a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and establish responsibility at the level of the individual abuser, the institution and the manage<Col N="294" /> ment and regulatory authorities. It is the Government's intention that the committee will have available to it the resources and all the legal powers and protections it needs to do this. In particular, the committee will have the kind of powers and protections which a court would have, including privilege for witnesses, compellability of witnesses, discovery of documents, taking evidence on oath and offences for failure to co-operate or for obstruction. This committee will also report to the commission.</P>
    <P>Upon completion of the work of the committees the commission will publish a report. The publication of this report containing the findings and recommendations of the commission is an essential part of the service which the commission can render to victims of abuse and society as a whole. The report will be published directly to the public by the commission. This is an important feature of the independence of the commission. The report of the commission will be based on the reports of the committees and any wider evidence heard by or in submissions to the commission. The Bill provides that in its report the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the people responsible and make findings in regard to the role and responsibility of management and regulatory authorities. The report, following the recommendation of the commission, will not make findings on any individual case as these are likely to be matters which are or will be the subject of civil or criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The commission in its report will also make recommendations. The Bill provides that these recommendations may relate to measures to alleviate the effects of abuse on victims. There are no preconditions or limitations on the independence of the commission in this regard. The commission in its recommendations will also look to the future care and welfare of children and will be empowered to make recommendations on how children can best be protected and abuse prevented in institutions.</P>
    <P>The commission will be entirely independent in performing its functions, a point specifically provided for in the Bill. Neither the Government nor anyone else will be in a position to influence its procedures or the outcomes of its inquiries. Following on the recommendations in the commission's report on its terms of reference, the Bill provides for some key procedural issues. The Bill specifically requires the commission to bear in mind the difficulties posed for people in telling of abuse in childhood and imposes a duty on the commission to ensure proceedings are conducted as informally as possible and that the atmosphere is sympathetic and understanding. These provisions are entirely consistent with the need to give victims a forum to tell of abuse and in so doing they should not be exposed to the sometimes harsh adversarial environment of a court.</P>
    <P>Related in part to this desire to avoid undue formality and an adversarial environment in commission meetings are the provisions in the Bill <Col N="295" /> which provide that the hearings of the confidential committee and the investigation committee relating to allegations of abuse be held in private. This approach was recommended by the commission primarily on the grounds of fairness. Any perceived lack of fairness on the part of persons accused would inevitably involve the commission in legal challenges. The making of specific allegations in a public forum would greatly increase the adversarial elements in the process at the expense of the listening therapeutic elements.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring a wide cross-section of people come forward to the commission to ensure the final report is as comprehensive as possible. In the case of former residents of institutions in particular, many may have difficulty in covering the costs of coming to the commission. On top of the emotional stress which recounting events of the past might cause, this financial burden could be the last straw which would make them decide not to come to the commission. To help alleviate this burden and encourage as many people as possible to come forward to the commission, the Bill provides for the drawing up of a scheme of expenses for witnesses. My Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance with a view to finalising a draft scheme of expenses for publication prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions relating to expenses I will also prepare a scheme relating to the issue of legal expenses. In principle the Government accepts the view expressed in the commission's report on its terms of reference that an administrative scheme for legal expenses should be put in place. This scheme, as a matter of constitutional right, must provide for legal representation of people against whom allegations are made and who cannot afford representation. I am aware that some people who want to bring allegations of abuse before the investigation committee may want to have legal support in so doing. It is my intention that they should. In devising the scheme under which legal expenses are to be paid, it will be necessary to strike a balance between that need for legal support, the therapeutic role of the commission and the objective that the commission hearings be held as informally as possible. As with the scheme relating to general expenses, it is my intention to publish a draft scheme for the payment of legal expenses prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to being offered a hearing by the commission and its committees, victims of abuse will be offered counselling by a dedicated counselling service which has been established by the Minister for Health and Children and is to be provided through the health boards. The Government has provided £4 million and arrangements are well advanced for the service. This has involved recruiting qualified and experienced counsellors to organise the service and provide counselling. It is intended that the service will be <Col N="296" /> operational in all health board areas by the time the commission begins its work. Through this counselling service it is hoped to help those victims of abuse who need professional help and who may not yet have sought or received it. The counselling service will also be open to those who have received or are receiving counselling.</P>
    <P>In May last year the Taoiseach, in announcing the measures relating to abuse of people in childhood, took as his starting point an apology to the victims of that abuse for the collective failure of society to intervene, detect the pain of victims and come to their rescue. The measures being put in place are not a break with the past but a facing up to it. We cannot consider ourselves to have matured into a self-confident and inclusive society unless we acknowledge and deal with the more uncomfortable elements of our past. The Bill and the commission it proposes to establish provide us with the best possible opportunity to do so but, while society as a whole can benefit from the work of the commission, let us not forget that this is a commission for the victims of abuse. It is a long delayed opportunity for them to receive the kind of respectful and sympathetic hearing which has long been their due.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent meeting of the Organisation of Survivors of Child Abuse voted unanimously to veto co-operation with the commission we are considering today. The obstacle to its participation is the Government's refusal to lift its exclusion of childhood victims of physical abuse from claiming civil damages under the new Statute of Limitations Bill. It is cynical for the Government to profess sorrow for the abuse and then deny the opportunity for redress. Confining the extension of time to initiate a civil action for damages to child sexual abuse alone is discriminatory and unworkable. It is surprising that the Minister has made no reference to the problem with the Statute of Limitations Bill even though those for whom this commission is being set up have made it clear in numerous public statements that this is a critical issue for them. The reality is that many trailblazers, who were the ones most determined to have their cases heard and who have been denied a hearing for so long, will not now have an opportunity to seek redress under the civil laws.</P>

      <P>Ms Justice Laffoy is to be commended on the tremendous work she has done in developing a model for investigating the horrendous history of child abuse in a sensitive and fair manner. However, the Government has departed in important respects from her recommendations. She specifically proposed that legal representation would be provided by the State for those who could not afford it through the offices of the Attorney General. This does not figure in the Bill. Today the Minister suggested a somewhat mealy-mouthed commitment in the House that he may provide legal support to victims. My understanding of the legal support the Minister has in mind is not the continuous legal representation of victims as a group so they can be present throughout hearings where evidence is being taken, but rather that individuals would have access to a lawyer during the hearing and any rebuttal of questioning that occurred. This is not the sort of legal representation which victims of abuse should receive from the State. We will need much greater clarity and a clear commitment from Government before Committee Stage is completed.</P>
      <P>Ms Justice Laffoy also clearly envisaged comprehensive support to survivors as they go through this process. The Minister suggested there will be a £4 million counselling scheme but it is unclear how this will be linked to the work of the commission. A person providing evidence will need not only legal support but also psychological and other counselling support through this process. I am disappointed the Bill is silent on this also. This is left to the accident of what will develop. I know the survivors are disappointed with what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Bill envisages the use of staff seconded from the Department of Education and Science to act as the administration for this inquiry. This is the Department which had responsibility for funding and regulating many of the institutions which will come under scrutiny in the inquiry. Surely this is insensitive at the very least and may also raise the issue of a conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> It is impossible to understand why the terms of reference of the commission have made no explicit reference to inquiring into the role of the State in the abuse that occurred. It is the State which is responsible for the legal frameworks which snatched children from their families and for the systems of regulation and inspection. It is the State which must answer as to whether this abuse could have been discovered at an earlier stage, or as to whether complaints were acted upon.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have, to some extent, had our sensitivity dulled to the cases of child abuse and the horrors of the crime which has occurred for years, but the personal stories which were revealed in the RTE programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; certainly reawakened even the most jaded conscience. Here we saw systematic abuse meted out to children in most need by those trusted with their care. These were children who had nowhere else to turn, no home to which to retreat and no ear to hear their story. This is what makes their betrayal all the more painful. The age old parable was once again acted out in real life. Children setting out on a lonely journey were set upon savagely and scarred for life and one by one those with authority walked by on the other side averting their eyes. No doubt each one could have offered explanations why he or she was not the one to take heed of the cries of anguish, but how hollow do these explanations ring beside the real life tales of a childhood brutalised, tales of an adolescence consumed in anger and frustration, tales of a spirit twisted and broken. There are no heroes in this story except those who have endured so much. There is their pain and grief, their tenacity and survival. Even now they are willing to tell their stories so that others may not suffer their fate. As their story has started to seep out, how often have they been belittled, denied or branded as deranged. To be a victim is bad enough, but to be denied is devastating.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has offered a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, detect their pain and come to their rescue. However, we must remember that an apology is only the start of making amends. We must learn from what has happened. The apology must be accompanied by sustained action long after the memories of these vivid stories have faded from the public mind.</P>
    <P>The record of the Department of Education and Science, documented in <i>Suffer the Little Children,</i> makes stark reading. There was no action on reports of criminal negligence where a child died from exposure to boiling water in a bath. Records were apparently destroyed and there was repeated insistence by the Department on institutionalisation so that the Minister might not be embroiled in inquiries if boarding out went badly. There was no regular inspection and there was rejection of the proposed visiting committees as a &ldquo;grave nuisance&rdquo;. The reality of what <Col N="300" /> occurred for so many years is astonishing. There were more than 1,000 children committed to industrial schools or institutions of different sorts each year. They were not orphans or offenders. That book shows that less than 5% were orphans and less than 5% were offenders. The book describes how the majority were taken from their families by the cruelty man and put into these institutions, supposedly for their own benefit, but the reality was very different. This was a highly interventionist State policy that went badly wrong. Apologies are necessary and I hope they are met with the same commitment to reform for the future.</P>
    <P>Institutionalisation was the easy option for the State. There was not any need for reports or regular inspections. There was no hassle and little cost. Individuals who perpetrated abuse cannot shoulder the whole responsibility for what happened. Some measure of responsibility must be taken by those who did not act on complaints, did not put safeguards in place, turned a blind eye and did not provide sufficient funding for children entrusted to the care of the State. As a State we must face up to past wrongs and make proper redress.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that the Minister does not refer to compensation. I know in my constituency that at a location no further than 200 yards from the Artane industrial school the tragedy of Stardust was quickly matched by a compensation tribunal that, ironically, sat in the same grounds as the school. It is surprising that we expect people to go the route of civil action. I cannot understand why the Government is not addressing this issue and seeing the merits of the compensation approach.</P>
    <P>We must act to ensure that children now in our care do not come to harm. It is wrong that the Laffoy commission has not been asked to make recommendations on the necessary changes to current policies, legislation and practices. We need provisions to reduce the detention of children, ensure professional resources are available to children who need them, appropriate settings are available particularly for those who are disturbed, provide visitors' programmes, complaints mechanisms and have statutory regulatory supervision applied equally to all institutions. None of this is in place. There are still many flaws in our legal framework.</P>
    <P>Commissions of inquiry in other countries have sought the views of children now in care to assess their risk of abuse. These commissions have found such risks to be present and real with few systematic programmes to reduce the risk. They found risks can seldom be identified in the flying visits of an inspector. Are we so confident that the position is different in Ireland that we do not ask for these issues to be directly addressed? If the Government decided no such review of the present provisions are to be undertaken by Ms Justice Laffoy and her commission, the onus is on the Minister to present, along with the Bill, the provisions he intends to introduce to ensure this <Col N="301" /> cannot happen again. We need to put on a statutory basis a children's ombudsman, whistle blowing procedures, a duty to report abuse, an obligation for suitable training for those providing care, and have common systems of regulation and inspection applied universally. We need a child complaints procedure and an advocacy service for young people in residential care. It is not enough to pack Ms Justice Laffoy off to do her work and comfortably sit on our hands while this goes on. There are many flaws in what we are doing.</P>
    <P>We will not learn if this process just leads to finger-pointing people and practices from the past. Many people seem to have been trapped where loyalty, fear of scandal or legal convention blinded them to their responsibility. The environment of not wanting to ask has not gone. Industrial schools may be closed but this can happen again wherever a child is in the custodial care of a person who has complete authority over him. This is not about raking over the past for its own sake. For the victims the past is still with them. The legacy can be overcome only if the whole community listens with an open heart and starts the process of healing. For the future, we must ensure there is someone whose job is to listen to those cries of anguish, who asks the awkward question and does not let known offenders slip quietly into the woodwork to reappear elsewhere. We must put in place a more robust legal framework to deal with children who are at risk of being neglected or abused.</P>
    <P>In any approach to redress, a guiding principle must be to do no further harm. This was the basis of Ms Justice Laffoy's proposal to divide the work of the commission between an investigation committee and a confidential committee. The Bill proposes that the commission shall not contain findings on particular instances of alleged abuse of children. Instead it will confine itself to findings of fact on general allegations that abuse was prevalent in a particular institution and with consequential findings ascribing responsibility to persons in the institution or in bodies charged with the duty of regulating the institution. Presumably this approach is designed to reduce the hostile testing by counsel for those accused, of the credibility of witnesses and the accuracy of their testimony through vigorous cross-examination. However, the Bill is far from clear on this point.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy's report indicates that even where findings in individual cases are not being made, individuals to whom responsibility is likely to be ascribed must be afforded constitutional rights that include, as a minimum, being furnished with a statement of every allegation, being allowed to cross-examine the person making the allegation, give rebuttal evidence and make submissions in their own defence. However, the Bill is silent on the position of the accused in these regards. This is a crucial point. It is important that we know in advance how the rights of the accused and the rights of the survivors of child abuse are to be balanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> We have seen in rape cases how the experience of cross-examination can be like a further violation. Where are the provisions that will prevent this? Ms Justice Laffoy clearly envisaged that there would be Chinese walls between the evidence presented to the confidential committee and the work of the investigation committee but it is not clear that this has been adequately covered in the Bill. Without this clarity could we find that the basis of the work of the investigation committee will be open to legal challenge? Ms Justice Laffoy was at pains to insist that the Bill should, from the date of its publication, make guilty of an offence, any person who destroyed documents. It is not clear this is being provided in section 30 where it would appear that it is only from the date of the enactment of the Bill that it will be an offence to destroy documents.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It is an opportunity for victims to have their cases heard and for the State to face up to its responsibilities. Ms Justice Laffoy is the right person to do this job. She has already shown her commitment. There must be continuous legal representation for the survivors of abuse so that, over the extent of the commission's work, they can have a continuous input and ask the questions they believe should be asked. This is important. I know the Minister wants to reduce the formality and not turn this into a tribunal such as those we have seen. It is crucial that survivors of child abuse have a key input into the way this work is approached. I am disappointed that the discussions between the Department of Education and Science and the survivors of child abuse appear to have gone off the rails at many points. There does not seem to be consensus on both sides that we have the formula to do this correctly. The worst of all is in regard to the statute of limitations where the Government continues to hold an untenable position with the kind of apologies it is offering. We must be confident that the survivors of child abuse understand and support the way the commission will work. The Minister must make great efforts to get it right. The Bill will require amendment on Committee Stage and clear commitments on how matters such as expenses are to be dealt with, particularly continuous representation. The Minister's intention will not meet the needs of survivors. He must face up to and change that position.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage where we will be able to go through in greater detail how the commission will work in practice. It is important that we strike the right balance in terms of the needs of survivors and that we do not expose them to hostile examination that would repeat the violation they have suffered. We must also be confident that the findings have the necessary legal robustness to stand up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this important debate on the establishment of a commission to inquire into child abuse. Without exception we were all horrified by the revelations in the televisions series <Col N="303" />&ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; and we unanimously welcomed the response of the Government, namely, the apology offered to victims and the proposals which the Government put forward to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that there is an element of knee-jerk reaction to the television series, and that all of us, particularly the Government which has responsibility, is inclined to view these horrific abuses as only being associated with the past, that we now have a much more enlightened attitude to children and that we apologise for what happened in the past. I think this is a dangerous mistake to make. I have no doubt that in ten years time there will be further television programmes examining child abuse in 1999 and 2000. We may no longer have the institutions, but we still have a considerable problem of abuse which is not being tackled at an official level. While the excuse of lack of funding, which is weak enough, might have been used in the past &ndash; the country was certainly very poor in the 1940s and 1950s &ndash; it cannot be used as an excuse for abuse in 2000. I remind the Minister that in spite of our huge economic prosperity, we have an average of 500 children waiting to be referred to a social worker because of allegations of physical, sexual or emotional abuse. What is the excuse for this? Equally, our cultural attitude to children has not changed much since the 1940s. We still see children as the objects of charity if they are lucky. In spite of signing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, we have not incorporated the provisions of the convention into our Constitution. Neither have we changed our attitude to see children as full citizens who should have full rights. The culture will only change when we start viewing children as full citizens with their own rights.</P>
      <P>It is also important to remind ourselves that we have a number of children incarcerated in a number of State institutions for such things as non-school attendance, which is termed a crime. It is an absolute scandal that a number of children are currently serving sentences up to two years for non-school attendance, a situation which continues because of the Government's failure to give adequate political attention to children's issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children have to compete for attention in a range of different Departments, principally the Department of Education and Science, but also the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs. Each Department has nominal responsibility for children, but children have to compete with adults for attention and so far children have lost out. Children have always been a second thought, especially in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. For that reason my party is very much in favour of the proposal to have a Minister for Children who would sit at Cabinet and with whom the buck would stop in relation to children. Unfortunately, <Col N="304" /> the widespread buck passing is continuing among Departments which have responsibility for children. Therefore, let us not just think of these scandals as a thing of the past. There are many scandals continuing to the present day, something of which we should be aware.</P>
    <P>The harrowing revelations of the abuse of children need and demand a response. Over the past five or six years in particular individual instances of appalling abuse suffered in silence by the most vulnerable children have shocked the country. We need a comprehensive inquiry into the instances, circumstances and extent of this abuse. An inquiry is necessary so that at long last the victims of abuse can have their voices heard, so that the people and institutions responsible for abuse can be held to account, and so that another generation of children can be protected from the gross abuse and negligence which occurred all too frequently in the past and which sadly continue in some cases.</P>
    <P>I and the Labour Party welcome the Bill. Devising a strategy to ensure the full truth emerges is a difficult task and I believe the structure proposed in the Bill, with the inclusion of a number of amendments, has the capacity to achieve what everybody in the House and elsewhere wants to see.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on two aspects of the Bill which give rise to serious concern and which I hope the Minister will address in detail in his reply. My first concern relates to the definition of abuse as outlined in section 1. Section 1(<i>a</i>) defines abuse as: &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child&rdquo;. I welcome this broad definition of abuse. However, how can the Government propose this rational and historically accurate definition of abuse while at the same time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform fought tooth and nail only a couple of weeks ago in the House to prevent a similarly accurate and rational definition of child abuse being included in the Statue of Limitations (Amendment) Act? This is an important point which the Minister does not seem to accept given his earlier exchanges with Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>I have met with many organisations which represent the survivors of appalling abuse in a number of institutions throughout the State. They see the establishment of the commission as being inextricably linked with the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act. However, it seems the Government is intent on maintaining the myth that different definitions of child abuse can be contained in different legislative measures debated within weeks of each other. Of course, the real reason for this legal double think is to reduce the State's liability and the potential cost to the Exchequer of cases taken by survivors of abuse under the Statute Of Limitations (Amendment) Act. This mean minded attitude of the Government during the debate on the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act casts a very dark cloud over the Commission to Inquire into <Col N="305" /> Child Abuse Bill. Surely the fact that abuse was inflicted on a child is an issue which cannot be dismissed due to fears of litigation. However, this is exactly what the Government has done. It proposes a broad definition of abuse in this Bill yet refuses to accept this definition of abuse when it comes to the humane and essential change to the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act. The contrast between both legislative measures is glaring.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Government to introduce amending legislation to ensure the victims of child physical abuse can seek redress through the courts. This is not a matter which can rest interminably with the Law Reform Commission. If we are really about to face up to the crimes of the past, such legislation must be introduced without delay. I ask the Minister to please respond in full to this point in his reply. It is an entirely inaccurate distinction to make between sexual and physical abuse as many of the victims of abuse in State institutions will testify. There is a very fine line between sexual and physical abuse and many victims have outlined how much physical abuse was inflicted on them for the purpose of sexual gratification. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. Equally, one cannot distinguish between the devastating effects of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. People are scarred for the rest of their lives. One only has to speak to the victims of such abuse to realise that physical and emotional abuse are just as harrowing and damaging as sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Another question that is pressing in regard to the statute of limitations in the minds of victims is the fact that people who came forward in good faith and reported abuse to their legal representatives or the Garda and were told that they were statute barred from pursuing their cases, are again excluded because of the failure of the new legislation to exempt those who had previously reported such abuse. Significant numbers of people are excluded because of the failure to address this issue in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The second issue I wish to raise with the Minister is the responsibility and possible culpability of the State in crimes against children. The definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo; contained in the Bill includes a school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital or a children's home. This is a comprehensive definition, which I welcome. However, a similar clear definition is not afforded to the investigation of the role the State, through various Departments, has played in the history of abuse which has damaged and destroyed thousands of young lives. The State's responsibility and political responsibility urgently require examination. The failure of a number of Departments to institute proper and rigorous inspection and reporting procedures at institutions, such as industrial schools or orphanages, must be investigated.</P>
    <P>My former party colleague, Pat Gallagher, undertook an extensive investigation into the <Col N="306" /> activities of a certain school teacher in the midlands over a number of years. The level of official denial that pertained in regard to this individual was quite shocking and facilitated his activities over a lengthy period. I hope the Minister is aware of this case and the role his Department may have played in failing to protect children from this abuser and the failure to report instances of abuse to the relevant authorities so that a prosecution could be considered.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the State to point the finger at institutions and religious orders. They acted <i>in loco parentis</i> and on behalf of the State in regard to children whom the State deemed to be in danger of neglect, for example, where the mother was a lone parent or was poverty stricken. The State deemed the parent to be incapable of providing adequate care for the child and, on its behalf, the institutions took large numbers of children into care. The same thinking is evident in the fact that issues relating to children and their protection do not deserve political priority, as the primary legislation governing children is still the Children Act, 1908, and has resulted in us debating the need for modern legislation to cover children and juvenile crime for 30 years, yet new legislation has not been passed. It should be borne in mind that this political culture operates on the basis that people do not count until they are 18 years, especially those from marginalised families. It is not a political issue and any legislation that is required is kept way down the list of priorities and much more important issues relating to adults will always take precedence over children's issues.</P>
    <P>The State is absolutely culpable for the neglect of children and its failure to provide the services which vulnerable and marginalised children needed. It was only too happy over many years to allow the religious orders, in particular, to take responsibility for the welfare and care of children. It cannot now avoid its responsibility and should not attempt to do so in this legislation. The State has a clear role in providing for the care, welfare and protection of children, a responsibility that was overlooked in the past.</P>
    <P>However, equally, complaints were made about the role of the State when abuse was reported to State agencies. The State had access to records and information and was seen as the authority to arbitrate in cases involving allegations of abuse, yet it failed to respond to such allegations. Officials did not reply to or lost letters, did not return telephone calls or told direct lies about their involvement in particular cases. All this activity needs to be addressed by the commission. A number of people were culpable in terms of neglect in the past and some may even still be in the State's employ.</P>
    <P>The State's failure to act and provide the resources needed to protect children is a historic reality and, sad to relate, a reality that continues to this day. One has only to examine the series of judgments handed down by Mr. Justice Patrick Kelly over a number of years to realise that the <Col N="307" /> basic infrastructure to protect vulnerable children is not in place. In many instances, the courts were required to send a young child to a place of detention, not because he or she had committed a crime but because there was no suitable place available in the State to provide him or her, who had a range of problems, with the necessary support.</P>
    <P>We should not fall into the trap of believing that the State's failure to protect children relates only to a period in the past. Its failure to vindicate and protect the rights of children continues to this day and I passionately hope that the conclusions and recommendations of the commission will force the political and administrative establishment to recognise this fact and ensure that a sea change takes place in how the State treats children.</P>
    <P>The twin track approach devised in the Bill, whereby a confidential committee and an investigative committee will be established, has created some concern among groups which represent the victims of abuse. The confidential nature of part of this inquiry will facilitate the exposure of the extent of abuse that has occurred in institutions since the 1940s and, indeed, before that time. There is considerable merit in accepting that there is a therapeutic value in establishing a confidential committee for victims who do not want to pursue legal channels but want to talk about the abuse they suffered and tell their stories. However, there is also an inherent danger in that approach because where there is confidentiality, there is also an opportunity for a cover up and secrecy and this is a mistake. We need to have some kind of account of what has transpired in the confidential committee. It is possible to do that with the omission of names, dates or the names of institutions, but it is essential that there is an ongoing narrative which tells the story of the history of abuse in this State over many years. For that reason, I ask the Minister to consider requesting a report from the confidential committee with the usual protections.</P>
    <P>That our society purposely ignored the plight of thousands of children in institutional care for decades is one of the major factors in preventing victims from coming to terms with and recovering to some degree from the abuse they suffered. There are obvious concerns about the lack of clarity in relation to legal representation. While the Bill refers to expenses to be paid for persons who are called as witnesses, the question of independent legal representation for the victims is critical, and I ask the Minister to address his attention to that.</P>
    <P>In relation to reporting, the Bill suggests that reports will be brought to Government within two years or within whatever period the Government so decides. My guess is that this commission is likely to sit for much longer than two years and it would be wrong to leave it until the end of the proceedings for a report to be issued. The legislation provides for interim reports and I ask the <Col N="308" /> Minister to amend the Bill to provide for regular reports &ndash; I suggest six monthly reports &ndash; so that this issue can be kept to the fore and to allow us create public awareness of the issue. The greatest protection we can afford to children in the future is the creation of an ongoing awareness of the possibility of abuse. There is a danger that this issue will be hidden and will go out of the public mind if it is left for two, three or four years. I ask the Minister to provide specifically for regular reports.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation cannot be avoided. There have been a number of incidences where people have received compensation, the most topical of which is members of the Army who received compensation from the State for hearing loss of varying degrees. If the State is prepared to pay compensation to soldiers whose hearing may have been marginally affected in some cases, the very least that should be done is to pay compensation to those people whose childhood were robbed from them due to State neglect. We cannot possibly get away from this issue. Equally, the Government's approach to the Statute of Limitations issue, the fact that people are statute barred and that physical abuse is not included, makes the need for a proper compensation tribunal or mechanism all the more urgent.</P>
    <P>The concerns that have been expressed to the Minister about the composition of the commission, and about one member of the commission, need to be urgently addressed. Certain allegations have been made that there may be a conflict of interest between the past employment of one of the commission members and the role he is being asked to undertake in the commission. This commission will only succeed if there is full confidence in its operation and in its members. For that reason I ask the Minister to address this complaint as a matter of urgency, I hope before this legislation is passed, because it is essential that there is full confidence in each of the members.</P>
    <P>I support the points made by Deputy Bruton in relation to access to records. The creation of an offence, the obstruction of access to records, should be backdated. That kind of activity is unacceptable at any stage and it should be specifically designated as a criminal offence from a far earlier date because I have no doubt that there are records in the Department of Education and Science which are currently not being made available. We do not have any guarantee that those records will not be damaged before this legislation passes through all Stages. That is an essential requirement of the commission and of the State. If we are to address this issue in an honest and wholehearted way we must ensure that all records are available.</P>
    <P>The question of funding for various organisations working with victims needs to be addressed. There should not be any question of funding from the Department of Education and Science, given the central role that Department has had in the institutional care of vulnerable <Col N="309" /> children through the years, but recommendations should be made that other Departments would provide the kind of support funding for these organisations to do the work they are attempting to do. It is particularly striking for any of us who have met various organisations and groups of victims of child abuse to see how terribly broken those people are as adults of 40, 50 and 60 years of age. One only has to meet them for a short while to realise that they are extremely damaged people. They have great difficulty in coming forward. They need our commendation for their courage in coming forward and helping us to face up to our past and to face up to their past which has been extraordinarily painful for them. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. We also owe Mary Raftery a debt of gratitude for facilitating those victims to come forward and exposing the abuse that has taken place in the name of the State over many years. Many other people are keen to participate in this commission and it is essential that basic financial support be provided for them so that they can provide counselling for their own members, organise themselves in a reasonably professional manner and provide the kind of encouragement and moral support to their own members in facing a very difficult task over the coming years. In coming before the commission and opening up their extraordinarily hurtful past, these people will be helping the State to face that past and will ensure that they get justice through the commission, and that their experience is adequately reflected. I appeal to the Minister to request one of his colleagues in some other Government Department to ensure that financial resources are provided to these organisations.</P>
    <P>I will make a number of other points, specifically in relation to provisions in the Bill, and I will be happy to go through those one by one on Committee Stage. This is a huge task that has been undertaken by Ms Justice Laffoy. It might be very successful. We just do not know at this point. It could end up being a lengthy talking shop or a major fudge of a number of issues. We have to wait and see, but a number of steps can be taken at this stage to ensure that everybody gets justice in this process. The most important of those is probably in terms of the Statute of Limitations and I stress to the Minister that this is the major obstacle. The current provisions in the Statute of Limitations Act is the major obstacle facing the many hundreds of thousands of people who have been abused at the hands of State-funded organisations. It is the major obstacle preventing those people receiving justice and fairness, and I ask the Minister to appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to amend that legislation. It seriously undermines the intentions the Taoiseach outlined in the statement he made in May of last year. The restrictions on the Statute of Limitations legislation is entirely incompatible with having an open and a rights-based approach to issues affecting people who were in State care. <Col N="310" /> I look forward to Committee Stage and discussing this in further detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation which establishes a commission to inquire into child abuse in State institutions. I strongly support the earlier remarks of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and applaud his initiative in ensuring this legislation was brought forward so quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the apology last May by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State to victims of abuse in childhood. This marked a significant step for our society in accepting that failures had occurred and also that the State had to undertake some responsibility in addressing the needs of victims. The making of an apology does not end the State's obligations to victims of these failures. It only strengthens the duty on the State to take appropriate and meaningful action to address those failures.</P>
      <P>Our society is based on a certain view of the State as the organ to regulate society, to provide essential services but, above all, to support the inalienable rights of our citizens. Our Constitution enunciates those rights clearly. The courts have and continue to enforce the State's obligation to provide for these rights. The establishment of this commission is a central feature of the State's continuing response to the Taoiseach's statement last May. There is a duty on the State to engage with victims of abuse, to listen to and, where appropriate, to investigate their story. The commission is acting on behalf of the State to provide, in a real and meaningful way, for this engagement.</P>
      <P>The rationale for the establishment of a commission is based on the needs of victims. Victims have continually expressed the view that a major part of any process of investigating abuse must be the need for an understanding and an acceptance of the failures of the past and a recognition of the wrong that was done to the victims. These issues are deep and fundamental. Victims want an opportunity to tell their story just for its own sake. Above all, they want people to listen to and accept their stories.</P>
      <P>It is also crucial that we consider the needs of victims in telling their story. The telling of a story of abuse will be a difficult, harrowing and intense experience for many victims. We want to ensure these victims have an appropriate forum to tell such stories. A commission is an appropriate forum to meet these needs. The Bill, therefore, provides that the commission must, in all its work, have regard to these particular needs of victims and must seek to provide as sympathetic and appropriate a forum as possible for victims to tell their story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the State's perspective, it is imperative that we seek to address the root causes of the failures of the past and to investigate why so many systems on the part of so many organis<Col N="311" /> ations appear to have failed in order to prevent this ever recurring. It is in this context, that is, the needs of the victims to be accepted and to tell their story and the need of the State and society as a whole to consider the past failures to prevent the abuse of the victims, that we have drafted this legislation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister already outlined, the commission will have three functions. First, it will have a listening role. The commission will listen to victims of abuse in a sympathetic manner. For some time, victims of abuse have been trying to get people to listen to their stories of the abuse they suffered in an open minded and sympathetic way. They have in certain situations in the past and, in my view, all too often, been ignored or dismissed. The commission will address this issue comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for the establishment of a confidential committee made up of dedicated members of the commission. The function of the committee will be to listen in a completely confidential manner to the stories of the victims. From these stories, the committee will be able to build up a report for the commission. In one sense, it might seem that this committee will have a relatively small role. It will not investigate cases of abuse but will simply listen to victims recount their stories. It will not call witnesses to give evidence nor will it provide for any examination of the testimony of witnesses. In fact, the confidential committee will have a huge role in the operation of the commission.</P>
    <P>We must remember the therapeutic role of the commission. The needs of victims must be catered for. I am aware that many victims of abuse simply wish to be able to recount their experiences without becoming involved in an investigative process. The process of investigation may be stressful and time consuming. Many victims may not wish to become involved in such a process. At the same time, there is an immense therapeutic value for these victims to simply tell their story to a sympathetic audience. The confidential committee will provide these victims with a forum to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>Second, the commission will have an investigation role. Victims are not a homogeneous group. While some will be satisfied to deal with the confidential committee other victims may wish to take this process further. Some will want to see their allegations fully investigated and hence the investigative committee will fill this role. This committee again composed of dedicated members of the commission will, as with the confidential committee, be open to any and all victims to come forward and tell their story but it will go much further than that.</P>
    <P>The committee is, under the legislation, specifically mandated to carry out a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and establish responsibility at the level of the individual abuse, the institution and the management and regulatory authorities. It is the Government's intention <Col N="312" /> that the committee will have available to it the resources and all the legal powers and protections it needs to do that.</P>
    <P>To provide for this the investigative committee will have the type of powers and protections a court would have. This includes such provisions as privilege for witnesses which ensures that witnesses will have the necessary freedom to make full and frank statements to the committee regarding their experiences. The committee will also be able to require that individuals produce any documents which it feels are necessary to allow it to have a full insight into the matters it is investigating. Finally, the committee will be able to hear evidence on oath. The legislation also provides that where individuals do not comply with orders of the committee or where a person gives false evidence to the committee, that person should be criminally guilty of an offence. Deputies will appreciate the significance of the role of the investigative committee. The committee will have as a duty to investigate, consider and report on the allegations of abuse brought to it by victims. The legislation provides for an appropriate range of powers for the committee to carry out its work and, where necessary, for the imposition of penalties on those who do not co-operate fully.</P>
    <P>The third major function of the commission is the preparation of a report for publication on the basis of the work of its committees. As the confidential committee will not seek to investigate the claims of individuals, the report will stress that any findings drawn from the work of the confidential committee have not been investigated. Obviously, this restriction will not apply to the work of the investigative committee. The exact nature of the report will be determined by the commission which, as I have noted, will be independent in the course of its work.</P>
    <P>However, the legislation requires the commissioners to have regard for the following principles in the preparation of their report. The commission should give consideration to recommendations to alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse suffered by victims. The commission should consider what action should be taken to reduce and prevent abuse in institutions and to protect children from such abuse. It is very important that the legislation should deal with those issues. The commission will, through its interaction with victims of abuse, be ideally placed to consider how the effects of this abuse might be addressed. Similarly, the commission will also be in a unique position to note the past failures to protect children in care and to make recommendations as to how this can be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>However, the report of the commission will go much further than these recommendations on general principles. The commission, where it is satisfied that specific abuses occurred in a particular institution, will be able to name that institution and the persons who committed the abuse and make findings in relation to the general man<Col N="313" /> agement, administration and operation of the institutions concerned. Deputies will appreciate that these are wide ranging and serious powers. The ability to name individuals whom the commission is satisfied have abused children in a report which will be published is not to be treated lightly.</P>
    <P>We must, however, place that within the context of the scale and nature of the abuse which the commission will investigate. In these circumstances, it is both reasonable and fair that the commission should have the powers which we have conferred on it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The commission's report will not in any circumstances identify victims or specific instances of abuse against victims. This is necessary to protect the rights of victims to privacy and is consistent with other similar measures scattered throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the report of the commission must be published within two years of the commencement of its work. This is a rigorous and imposing deadline. While there is potential for this timeframe to be extended in the event of unforeseen circumstances, I feel strongly that it is important that the work of the commission should proceed with all urgency. The issues with which it deals are real and urgent and deserve to be treated as a priority.</P>
    <P>The commission will be independent in its operation. This is crucially important to allow it to work in a fair and effective manner and to ensure its report is seen to be of the highest possible standard. For that reason we have taken extra care to ensure the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions in terms of establishing it on a statutory basis, including provisions in the Bill which specifically protect its independence and through carefully selecting its membership.</P>
    <P>As part of ensuring that the commission is fully independent in its functions, it is important that the necessary resources and support should be available to it to enable it to do its work. The provision in section 24 that the commission may appoint advisers to assist it in any or all of its functions will meet this important need. This power is of particular value in assisting the commission in the formulation of its report and allowing it to draw on national and international research and practice to inform its recommendations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important measure to deal with a specific and shameful episode in our history. Neither this Bill nor any measure can fully address the sufferings of victims of abuse in our industrial schools. However, we can listen to the needs and requests of victims and seek to ensure they are met in so far as that is possible.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure this abuse can never recur. Accordingly, this Bill has three aims. The first is to meet the needs of victims to recount their story in a sympathetic and open environment, the second is to investigate, where appropriate, the experiences of those victims and <Col N="314" /> the third is to report to Government on the specific findings and more generally on recommendations for future policy in terms of the needs of victims and the protection of further generations. I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill which is long overdue. It is important to know what happened to those who were physically and sexually abused under the supervision of the State; their story must be heard. While the Taoiseach apologised to those who suffered during that awful period, apologies are not enough. We must make restitution to those who suffered so inhumanely under the guise of protection, education and surrogate parenting. We must also learn from what happened and ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton referred to the fact that psychological and counselling support is not included in the Bill. The provision of counselling for those who will give evidence to the commission and for those who suffered is a vital part of their rehabilitation to enable them to come to grips with what happened, to deal with the past and to be able to move on. Many will never get over the difficulties they experienced. That need should be addressed. If the Minister is indicating he will address it, I accept that.</P>

      <P>It will be provided on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, but we would like to have had details on how it will operate, the type of support that will be given and the resources that will be provided for it. I ask the Minister to outline in detail that important area of support for the victims who suffered so much during that period.</P>
      <P>The State has a case to answer for the neglect and abuse that occurred during that time. Abuse was meted out to the most vulnerable, those who did not have the advantage of normal parenting and normal homes. Many of those abused were orphans or those whose mothers or fathers had died, and their only crime was being poor. It is a disgrace that those children who were so vulnerable were treated in such a way. We must learn from and address the difficulties they experienced. The level of sexual abuse visited on many of those vulnerable children was horrific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most sexually abused children suffer long-term traumatic disorders. Such children usually have a range of mental health problems. They often inflict self-harm either directly through deliberate self-injury or self-mutilation or indirectly through eating disorders and drug abuse. Once children have become victims of abuse, they tend to suffer further abuse in their later lives at the hands of the same persons or other perpetrators. Children <Col N="315" /> who are abused in a family situation are often more vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles when they reach school age and adolescence. The paedophile identifies these people and targets them by offering them some form of comfort and attention. Paedophiles played on the vulnerability of children in industrial schools. They were attracted to such schools because of the vulnerability of the children and the opportunity that presented for them to act out their abuse and their vile desecration of the person.</P>
    <P>Victims of child abuse are likely to suffer deep and extremely traumatic effects as teenagers and as adults. They may suffer from multiple personalities, bouts of alcohol consumption to the point of feeling suicidal, depression and elation, having a nervous breakdown, long periods of life spent alone in self-imposed isolation from human beings due to mistrust and disbelief in humanity, discarding friendships like a spoilt child throws away sweet papers and an inability to recognise the difference between reality and fantasy. They live most of their lives in a state of fear. That is the effect sexual abuse has on most people who are visited with such abuse in childhood.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate RTE for its exposure in &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; of the brutal and sadistic cruelty which was visited on the most vulnerable children in our society, those under the supervision of State institutions. I welcome that the State acknowledges its role in the severe damage caused to many children and the apology made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State. To make a full apology, the full facts surrounding the matter and the level of abuse must be known and culpability for the abuse must be established. This must be the key role of the commission which is being established legislatively today.</P>
    <P>Why should children who fell on hard times be battered, brutalised, dehumanised and made victims of sexual abuse? Their only crime was that they were poor. These people will now have their stories heard and their suffering will be understood. They must receive a compassionate response from the State. We must make sure that what happened will not recur, but it can and does happen. I refer to the case of a 15 year old which was raised in the courts this week. The girl was abused and involved in prostitution. At 15 years of age she was out of control and the State had no way of dealing with her. Mr. Justice Kelly said the very distressing case highlighted once again the State's failure to provide appropriate places for such children in crisis.</P>
    <P>Such abuse can recur, but we must ensure that this generation of legislators is not found culpable of failure to act. Child abuse continues. The level of abuse is increasing, yet there is a high level of legislative neglect. Consistently we hear of incidents that are reported to the Garda Síochána where suspicious approaches have been made to children, yet the Government has not introduced a child sex offenders' register. Fine Gael has been <Col N="316" /> seeking this since May 1998 when the party introduced the Child Sex Register Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Government has published a Bill in this area in recent times, there seems not to be any urgency to bring the legislation before the House. While it is not a panacea for getting over all the problems of paedophilia and other forms of child abuse, it is an important tool in the hands of the State in controlling the situation.</P>
    <P>We urgently need a children's ombudsman office established on a statutory basis to promote and protect children's rights. Children have a right to feel safe and not to be brutalised or dehumanised. They have a right not to suffer sexual abuse. They have a right to be treated with the same respect for their person and dignity as every human being. A children's ombudsman would ensure that these rights are upheld as far as possible and that a situation similar to the one we are discussing today would not develop in future.</P>
    <P>On 21 September 1992, Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, without reservation and accepted its international obligation towards children. The convention states that:</P>
    <P>All those who signed shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights accordingly.</P>
    <P>Having ratified the convention, the Government is obliged to take steps to ensure compliance with the provision to protect and promote children's rights. A children's ombudsman is a priority. The Government has announced that it will introduce such a body, but we do not yet have the details. We do not know if it will be on a statutory or non-statutory basis, or whether it will be under the Department of Health and Children. A children's ombudsman without a statutory footing and one that is not obliged to report to the Oireachtas would not be of any assistance.</P>
    <P>There are a significant number of children in situations of considerable disadvantage in the time of the Celtic tiger. These include children in care or in legal custody, children who are subject to abuse and neglect, homeless children and those with disabilities. The Government should establish a children's ombudsman as an overall mechanism for the promotion of the rights of children. While we cannot undo the past, we can recognise and apologise for what happened and have the facts examined, as we are proposing today. We must also ensure, however, that what happened in those tragic years will not recur in any guise or form, institutionalised or otherwise. We have a duty as legislators to ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <P>At its first general meeting in March 1995, the children's rights alliance decided that one of its main concerns would be the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children, which it felt would play a significant role in implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in ensuring that children's rights were respected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Following its examination of the first national report on the implementation of the convention, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about Ireland's lack of an independent monitoring mechanism, such as an ombudsman or a children's rights commissioner, accessible to children for dealing with complaints or violation of their rights and to provide remedies for such violations.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that the Government should positively consider the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children to further the implementation of the convention in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Public discourse with children has been minimalist in nature, as was shown by the notable exception of children among the principal education players in the 1994 National Education Convention. There was nobody to speak for children at that convention &ndash; the most important educational forum of its time &ndash; even though students are the customers of the education system.</P>
    <P>The Constitutional Review Group, CARI, the Kilkenny incest team investigation, and the report of the 1995 Kelly inquiry have all stated that the Constitution's strong emphasis on the rights of the family may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to those of children.</P>
    <P>The constitutional clarification of children's rights would assist in the creation of a positive environment for a newly created statutory office of ombudsman for children. Consequently, specific and overt declarations should be inserted into the Constitution on the rights of children. This would involve the amendment of Articles 41 and 42.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman for children should be allowed to sit and monitor child protection standards, promote examples of good practice and inquire into serious failures of practice. It is essential, in this context, that the ombudsman enjoys <i>locus standi</i> to take legal action in the event of a public body acting in serious breach of its obligations to children. The ombudsman for children, however, should not become involved in legal proceedings until internal complaints or appeals procedures have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>In establishing the ombudsman for children, the Government would give recognition to children's fundamental political, social, economic and civil rights not yet enshrined in legislation. The ombudsman would be an investigator or neutral fact finder of children's legitimate problems and complaints. With all the freedom, autonomy and authority of the office, the ombudsman for children should tell it like it is and as it ought to be, and provide a responsive forum to voice children's particular and general grievances. The ombudsman should ensure that children are perceived as autonomous persons with their own special needs and rights.</P>
    <P>By establishing a children's ombudsman's office the State would provide a significant State institutional medium through which children and <Col N="318" /> young people can be heard and a conflict free environment through their formative years, from birth to voting age. The children's ombudsman should speak for children in the context of Government services and non-services, facilitating and accommodating remedies for wrongs and omissions inflicted on children and would lead the way to ensuring that what was experienced by the brutalised and dehumanised children as outlined in the television programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; would not happen again. The principal themes of an ombudsman should be the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children and young persons in difficulty and young persons' rights of participation. The UN convention should be an important ideological instrument for asserting children's perspectives in different respects. The ombudsman should systematically review legislation affecting children and propose amendments to have Irish law respond to the principles of the convention.</P>
    <P>The children's perspective must be made a natural ingredient of all relevant new legislation. Consultation procedures on new legislation must be created and the ombudsman's office should make recommendations to govern bodies and should also be involved in drafting legislation itself. The ombudsman should also have the task of disseminating information and knowledge on the UN convention to the general public, professionals working with children and decision makers. The convention is something which has to be lived. This means adults behaving towards children in such a way as to respect and sustain their full human dignity. It also means shaping society in such a way that children and young persons receive the protection and support they need in order for childhood and adolescence to have an intrinsic value.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman should also be involved in trying to implement the convention at local government level. He or she should also devote special attention to questions of children at risk, victimisation and sexual abuse, all these should be matters of prime concern to the ombudsman. The ombudsman should act as a spokesman for children and young persons and one of his or her tasks should be to represent children and young persons and to assert their interest in the community. He or she should represent young people by trying to secure for them the opportunity of speaking for themselves and gaining respect for their opinions.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the past and to some extent this is happening. We must respond to those in crisis and ensure that they come through their difficulties. However, we must also set up structures to ensure that the victimisation and abuse that is happening is dealt with. Situations such as that of a 15 year old girl being lured into prostitution by evil people &ndash; charging people £80 for sex and giving half of that to a woman involved in the operation &ndash; should not happen. An ombudsman would deal with many of these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation and I hope it is passed quickly. Last May the Taoiseach announced measures dealing with abuse and issued an apology on behalf of the Government to the victims of abuse for the collective failure of Irish society to detect, intervene and rescue those victims. This legislation is very welcome, as it is important to have a forum wherein people can tell of the abuse involved and which can investigate allegations of abuse and the extent to which institutions, management and regulatory authorities had responsibility for that abuse.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned publishing a report for the public, which I welcome. I understand the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and those who committed it. It may also make findings as to the responsibility of the authorities involved in respect of abuse and may identify persons who failed to carry out their functions. The Minister said we should avoid a witch hunt and I agree, though I do not think that will happen. The objective is to establish all the circumstances, both good and bad, relating to the operation, management and regulation of institutions which cared for children. The definitions section of the Bill is very welcome, particularly the broad definition of abuse as the failure to care for a child where this seriously affects a child's health, development, behaviour, welfare or any other act or failure to act which results in serious damage to the health, development, behaviour or welfare of a child. That is a very good definition.</P>
      <P>The Bill should include a reference to bullying, which has resulted in serious damage to the health, development, behaviour or welfare of children. Unfortunately it is still an issue in many institutions today. When looking at those who manage institutions we should also look at the people involved in bullying in these institutions.</P>
      <P>An institution is described by the Minister as a school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital or a children's home. Again, that is a very broad definition. The Minister has taken a period from 1940 to 1999 and it would be welcome if he looked at the period before 1940 and allowed the timeframe to continue to the present. I have heard stories from older generations about the tough regimes in boarding schools prior to the 1940s; these people should be allowed to tell their stories. When comparing the accommodation and sustenance available in the 1930s and 1940s with what is available now one is not comparing like with like, but if people want to come to the commission they should be given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to a boarding school and enjoyed my time there. However, many of my classmates have said that if one was not involved in sport, whether it was gaelic football, hurling &ndash; those were the days before the Ban was lifted &ndash; handball, swimming or athletics, there was very little to do. It is sad to think that there was not enough time for art, drama or music but there was a concentration on getting honours to go on to third <Col N="320" /> level education if one was able. Our school had more facilities than others, but boarding schools probably got a bad press. Many allegations have been made about industrial schools and reformatories and I congratulate RTE on their investigation of this issue.</P>
    <P>The definition section provides that references to abuse in institutions include abuse which occurred outside an institution to a child who was at the time resident there and which was assisted or contributed to in any way by a person connected with the institution. I welcome the fact that the Minister has included this provision in the Bill because it is something which could be forgotten about. The commission will publish a report within two years of its establishment setting out the results of its inquiries and findings, which I welcome. I also welcome the fact that interim reports may be published if necessary. I would like the Minister to refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Section 10 refers to the fact that two committees will be established &ndash; a confidential committee and an investigation committee. The confidential committee will be largely therapeutic in terms of the abuse suffered by people in these institutions who do not wish to have that abuse inquired into. The investigation committee is more relevant to what is being discussed here today. There have been many difficulties in the past in relation to reporting of child abuse. I was a member of the Western Health Board for one term when there were many debates about mandatory reporting. I was amazed to hear the professionals involved stating how difficult this is because of a lack of resources. The Minister of State at the time, Deputy Fahey, spoke on many occasions of his concern about an overly legalistic approach which would be counter-productive and drive the problem underground so that less abuse would be reported. The commissions which are being set up will give people an opportunity to come forward and tell their story. I look forward to the day when there will be sufficient resources to put a proper reporting procedure in place.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the importance of counselling. I was pleased to hear the Minister mention a figure of £4 million, which I welcome, and I hope a counselling service will soon be available. The psychological service is also very important. This issue needs serious attention because many students who are preparing for examinations in a few months time need this type of help. This has not been available to date and it needs to be considered in the context of the whole education system, beginning at first level. It is not sufficient to say there will be counselling when a crisis arises, it must be an ongoing service. I hope the Minister will make provision for this service.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted, it will be important to have recommendations on how children can best be protected and how abuse can be prevented in future. Given the funding provided by the Minister, children should not now be <Col N="321" /> exposed to an adversarial courtroom environment. I welcome the fact that he has removed any financial burden in relation to general expenses. I believe people would not come forward with complaints if an expenses procedure was not in place. The Minister has also prepared a scheme to deal with the issue of legal expenses which I hope will be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Neville's call for a children's ombudsman. This is an important issue about which I have spoken to the Department of Health and Children and the health board on various occasions. Many of the submissions I received from the Combat Poverty Agency referred to a serious problem with child poverty. At the end of last year, the agency, together with other organisations such as Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, published the most recent figures available to them. They stated that child poverty is so serious an issue in Ireland that between one-quarter and one-third of children are at risk of living in poverty. They also stated that child poverty is a denial of the basic rights of the child, those who grew up in poverty are likely to do less well in school, have fewer recreational, social and cultural opportunities and be more at risk of becoming involved in crime and anti-social behaviour. They also state that children today are powerfully influenced by what happened to them as a result of poverty and that this damages their health and development.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Neville's call because what has been stated in the report in relation to specific groups at risk is worth investigating. One of the groups mentioned in the report is Traveller children and young people. The report states that there should be particular focus on the adequate resourcing of appropriate and quality pre-school services and provision of extra supports to enable Traveller children to access primary and post primary education. It also refers to children and young people with disabilities and children out of home.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister had to say because these issues are difficult and uncomfortable to talk about. However, I am pleased the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science have faced up to these issues so that those who have been abused in the past will receive a respectful and sympathetic hearing when they come before the commission. This is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill. I pay tribute to the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, who did much of the work on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a climate of greater accountability, openness and transparency. Sometimes that is a very uncomfortable climate for professional politicians such as ourselves. However, investigative journalism has shone its torch light on the whole <Col N="322" /> area of child sexual abuse and what happened in the early years of the State. We should be grateful for this because, while it might sometimes be uncomfortable in this era of tribunals and so on, it has delivered a considerable number of positive results. Were it not for that type of investigative journalism, we may not have unearthed the scale of this problem which needs to be investigated further.</P>
    <P>It is important to construct the best possible framework so that the commission can investigate the problem and come up with realistic solutions. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a commission to inquire into child abuse. It has three functions: a therapeutic function in so far as it will provide for people who suffered child abuse in institutions, a forum in which they can speak of that abuse; an investigative function to inquire into allegations of abuse to determine its nature, the circumstances in which it occurred and to establish the extent to which institutions, management and regulatory authorities had responsibility for the abuse; and a reporting function, i.e. to publish a report.</P>
    <P>In its report the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the persons who committed it. It may also make findings as to the responsibility in respect of abuse of the management, supervisory and regulatory authorities and may identify persons who carried out or failed to carry out their functions. The report may also contain recommendations relating to the measures necessary to address the continuing effect of abuse on people who suffered, and recommendations relating to the prevention of child abuse in institutions.</P>
    <P>At a cursory glance it would appear to be an all-embracing commission and one that should resolve the problem. I have some reservations in so far as it differentiates between victims of child sexual abuse &ndash; those in institutions run by the State and other victims of child sexual abuse. One might say the State cannot be held responsible or accountable in respect of abuse that occurs in a family setting. I have had a meeting with a individual in my constituency who is the victim of abuse within a family circumstance. A group of victims of abuse within the home, with whom he is in contact, are of the view that implicit in the commission is a two-tier recognition of victim status and that they are a poor second. The report on the terms of reference refers to this when it states: </P>
    <P>While the Commission appreciates that it might seem to be invidious to exclude one class of victim from this inquiry, nonetheless, the Commission considers that to be the appropriate course. The Commission believes that its work would be immeasurably increased if abuse within a family setting was covered by its Terms of Reference.</P>
    <P>So what if its work is immeasurably increased? I find it difficult to accept that statement. The report continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> This is a minor consideration. The major consideration is that different issues arise in relation to institutional abuse on the one hand, and abuse within a familial setting, on the other hand, and, if the Commission were to attempt to deal with the totality of the issues, there is a risk of disaffection among victims of institutional abuse and that the therapeutic benefit of the Commission's function for those victims could be detrimentally affected.</P>
    <P>The victims of abuse within a family setting are equally in need of someone to listen to their story. It is hardly good enough to say that because it would increase the workload of the commission we should allow it to be continued outside its remit. Even if we take it that, under the Constitution, the primary unit of responsibility for children is the family I fail to see the reason for differentiating between the family and victims of abuse within a State setting. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that issue in his reply. I am of the view that will create a two-tier approach to the issue. It is unknown the number who would come forward if the commission was open to hear from victims of abuse within a family setting. Equally, they are victims. They have suffered and many want to tell their story. There is a therapeutic benefit in telling their story. The Bill, while welcome, is flawed in that respect.</P>
    <P>The recent statement of apology by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State was an important acknowledgment of the failings of the State, in terms of its regulatory responsibility. Equally important was the statement yesterday, Ash Wednesday, by the Archbishop of Dublin, Desmond Connell, who made an implicit reference to this issue. Both statements give half the picture since nobody knows the extent of the problem. However, there are a number of people to whom nobody has apologised. While the other victims are unable to get redress from the State because they were not in State run institutions, they need the therapeutic effect of relating their story to somebody.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt on the matter of bullying at school. I am not sure if the issue is appropriate to the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious issue and causes major trauma for victims though it may not be comparable with sexual abuse. I take the Minister's assurance that it is covered within the terms of reference of the Bill. To close the door on those who suffered abuse within a family setting because it might be an open-ended approach is not sufficient reason not to acknowledge that problem is there and that these are real victims also. The commission should not refuse to listen to that problem on the basis that the amount of work it might open up is unquantifiable. Even if it necessitated the commission sitting for a long period it would do very good work if it were to <Col N="324" /> listen to those people. Those are just a few preliminary observations on the Bill which I support and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to lend my support to the commission being set up on a statutory basis by the Government. As one who has spent many years teaching I also had the pleasure of serving on a board of management of one of the State's schools where young people were detained at the State's pleasure. Like other speakers I am glad the Taoiseach, on behalf of all of us, acknowledged the extent of abuse which has occurred and apologised for it. That the commission which had been set up on an administrative basis is being set up on a statutory basis is welcome. As a result of the broadcasting of programmes such as &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; Irish society is opening up and is prepared to confront the blemishes which have existed for years. We may now have achieved a sufficient level of maturity to confront those blemishes, acknowledge the hurts, investigate the perpetration of abuse on vulnerable young people and provide therapeutic opportunities for these people to tell the commission what they have suffered.</P>
      <P>However unpalatable, the facts of abuse need to be brought into the open and the commission is an eminently suitable vehicle for this. It is important that the commission will be available in a confidential manner to listen to the stories of victims of abuse. The commission's three key functions of listening, investigating and reporting are crucial. The horrendous stories of victims must be listened to with great care and sensitivity and at great length. No limit should be put on the time the commission will spend listening to these stories. We have no idea how many people will wish to avail of the services of the confidential committee simply to get a huge burden off their shoulders and to tell their stories to sympathetic listeners who will be in a position to do something about them. Others will wish to avail of the investigative function of the commission and to seek redress in court. That too is important.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the fact that the report will be published directly by the commission itself, along with recommendations. I hope the recommendations will be listened to and acted upon as speedily as possible. We do not have a good record of implementing child care reports, certainly not as speedily as we should. If the recommendations of some previous reports had been put into effect we might not have needed this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the very damaged people who are victims of child abuse emigrated, perhaps to Britain where they have lived in very poor circumstances. Some are long-term unemployed or have become part of the homeless population in that country. These people will wish their stories to be heard but it is unlikely that many of them will wish to come back to Ireland for that purpose. For that reason, I recommend that the commission be <Col N="325" /> given the right and the resources to travel to major population centres in Britain and even to centres in the United States and elsewhere where people may have gone to get away from the trauma they suffered. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of enabling the committee to take evidence abroad. This would not compromise the functions of the committee.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that £4 million will be made available to the Department of Health and Children for counselling. I suspect that much more will be required but the £4 million will be an important first step. The establishment of the commission is a very significant development. The Minister, his predecessor Deputy Martin, and the Government are to be commended for their determination and courage in setting it up.</P>
    <P>In many of the centres which will be investigated, a difficult job was done extremely well in adverse circumstances. In some centres there were people who perpetrated horrendous damage on young people in their care. At the same time we should not lose sight of the fact than many people did a great deal of good work and this must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to support the setting up of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our duty to look after all the children of the State but we have an even greater responsibility when those children are in the care of State institutions. Last year it was necessary for the Taoiseach to make a public apology on behalf of the State to people who had been the victims of abuse in industrial schools or when otherwise in the care of the State. That apology was one step towards redressing some of the wrongs which had been perpetrated against young people, and the establishment of a commission to inquire into child abuse is another step along that road.</P>
      <P>The commission was established last year on an administrative basis. The fact that it is now formally established on a statutory basis will give it the legislative power to listen and investigate, but more particularly, to report and make recommendations, and will enable us to ensure that such actions never happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Ms Justice Mary Laffoy for taking on the role of the commission last year, knowing that it could be a very lengthy process and one which required sensitivity and understanding. With Dr. Imelda Ryan and Mr. Bob Lewis she has led us to the formulation of the Bill to establish the commission on a statutory basis. Their aim of allowing victims of abuse to tell their story in a sympathetic, experienced and confidential forum, knowing that their evidence will be the basis of future reports, is important. It is important that legislators form an accurate picture of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and other places since 1940. It is not enough to rely on television and radio programmes. It is twice as <Col N="326" /> important to hear directly from victims to get that overall picture on which the report will be based. It will not be a secret or quiet report which will be lodged on the back dusty shelves but one which will be made public. All the findings of the commission will be made public. Its recommendations can then be worked on in order to safeguard children.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that in preparing the Bill the Minister consulted not just the commission which worked hard on the Bill but also victims and victims' groups to ensure the commission, when placed on a statutory basis, responds to their needs. I look forward to the commission commencing its work quickly as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties of victims in reviving their memories, reliving their experiences and the trauma they experienced in their childhood years. It is particularly important, therefore, that the counselling service established by the Department of Health and Children is ready to go into action immediately. The £2 million provided at the end of last year and the £4 million to be provided this year will ensure there will be qualified and experienced counsellors who will organise the service and provide counselling.</P>
    <P>The aim is that the service will be free, community based and confidential. It will be available locally, no matter where one lives in the country, and there will be no differentiation in its value as between one area and another. It will help victims to tell their story and move towards a reconciliation with their lost childhood. It will help those who need professional assistance, those who have received or are receiving it. I hope many will come to the conclusion that they can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>What I particularly like about the Bill is that it provides for a confidential listening as well as investigative role. There are many victims who just want their story to be told to ensure it will never happen again. Many victims faced a situation where there was an unwillingness at many levels to listen to their story and account of the abuse they suffered. The ability to recount an experience of abuse in a sympathetic environment is an essential element to enable victims come to terms with the abuse they have suffered. The need for such an opportunity has been identified by victims and is a crucial element of the structure being created. I hope the commission will meet this need, largely through the establishment of the confidential committee. This will ensure, although the process will be slow and sympathetic, that those victims who do not wish to take their case further but will gain some relief from telling their stories need not do so. They may be of the view that the process of investigation will prove very stressful or too time consuming for them and that they are not in a position, emotionally, to participate in it. The confidential committee has been designed with their needs in mind.</P>
    <P>It is very important also that those victims who want to initiate an investigation process should be <Col N="327" /> in a position to do so to consider in more detail the stories of their abuse. They want to know how and why. The investigative committee has been designed with a specific role in mind. It will have specific powers and duties to investigate the issues that arise as victims recount their stories. The Bill places a duty on it to conduct a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and establish the responsibility of individuals, institutions, management and regulatory authorities. These are hugely important and wide-ranging functions.</P>
    <P>The commission is being instructed to provide the investigative committee with the powers and protections of the High Court. What this means is that the commission will be able to undertake its role in a very thorough and full manner by allowing witnesses privilege and the necessary freedom to make full and frank statements to the committee regarding their experiences and by allowing the committee the power to require the production of relevant documentation for inspection. Work has begun in the Department of Health and Children in assembling all the relevant documentation. The Department is co-operating in full with the commission. I am confident that the health boards will not only fulfil their legal obligation but also their moral duty to co-operate in full with the commission. The Bill allows for the imposition of penalties on individuals who do not comply with the orders of or give false evidence to the committee. I hope there will never be a need to enforce these penalties as there is a legal as well as a moral duty to co-operate with the commission.</P>
    <P>In giving all these powers to the committee we are showing that we are serious about child abuse. It is imperative, therefore, that the committee has all reasonable assistance to allow it fulfil its function as effectively as possible. Without these powers it would be severely hampered in its ability to consider issues at the appropriate level. Our ability to understand and assess the issues involved in cases of abuse would be correspondingly reduced. This would remove at least half of the value of the commission by removing our ability to know and, more particularly, to learn.</P>
    <P>None of us will look forward to the report of the commission, except in the context of learning from its recommendations to ensure such events are never repeated. The report will be absolutely crucial as it will facilitate our understanding and response. It is welcome that it must be made available to the wider public to enable it understand the issues involved in all these cases.</P>
    <P>The fact that the commission is being asked to make recommendations to ensure the abuse of children in institutions is prevented will help us in formulating our policies. As Minister of State with specific responsibility for the welfare of children, especially those in residential care, I am particularly conscious of this and looking forward to receiving the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> The social services inspectorate is already undertaking inspections of child care facilities and residential homes under the Child Care Act, 1991, and has commenced its reports. It is this type of inspection that can give the public an assurance that the highest of standards are being maintained and that the welfare of children in the care of the State is paramount.</P>
    <P>The commission will devote specific consideration to addressing the damage done to victims of abuse. It is vital that this is considered as individuals have suffered a great trauma. Their history is always with them, no matter where they live or work. From its constant interaction and discussions with victims of abuse, the commission will be best placed to make recommendations on this issue. Its recommendations on how damage to victims can best be assessed and, more particularly, how they can be helped will be made public. In addition, it will be able to name individuals who committed abuse. This is a very far-reaching power. The ability to name an individual in a report being made available to the public is something the commission must consider carefully. Obviously the commission, involving such notable people as our Members, must weigh up all of the evidence before making this decision, but where it is satisfied that it has sufficient evidence it is right to name individuals. We must always remember that the context of the Bill, namely to inquire into the abuse of children, means that many questions will be asked and it is important that the commission and the report should answer many of those questions. This is a serious issue for society and we should aim to take fundamental action in facing it. The provisions of the Bill are designed to do this.</P>
    <P>The true test of any society is how it treats its children. An enlightened society is one which values children in their own right, treats them with care and dignity, ensures their safety and nurtures their full potential. We all want this for every child. It was not always the way in the past but we all must always ensure it happens in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. Nobody could have imagined the level of hurt, abuse and terror which was inflicted on so many of the nation's children during this century in industrial schools and other institutions. It is also true that the revelations, which were largely brought to light be the RTE programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, are not new. Many people were quietly aware of what was happening in these institutions but nobody wanted to talk about it. It was a case of hear no evil, speak no evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has now arrived for the State to come to terms with the horrific abuses which were inflicted on children through no fault of their own, but because of unfortunate circumstances, perhaps illness, family bereavement or a disability, they were forced to live in an institution. The time has come for the people to state collec<Col N="329" /> tively that we do not stand over those actions which have ruined the lives of these victims. While the State did not have a direct role in the day to day operations of the industrial schools and institutions, it was nevertheless the official financier and inspector and, therefore, it did have a responsibility for these children.</P>
    <P>Some of those interviewed on the programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; had the ability to communicate, either in voice or through sign language, but I fear there are many people with severe disabilities who attended these institutions who are unable to communicate the hurt and pain they endured. We now have a responsibility to ensure those people who are not able to speak out for themselves will also be looked after in the Bill. Until we carry out a case by case investigation into each file on record, we will never really appreciate the extent of the suffering of people with many of these disabilities. The scars of the abuse which have been brought to light by the brave victims who have spoken out will never fade. We can only hope that they and those who are unable to come forward are given all the support they require to allow them to try to live a full and wholesome life.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will ensure above all else that the truth will be established without any further trauma or hurt to those who it is intended to support. The Bill must, above all, ensure compassion, understanding and justice for those who have been victims. No matter what the outcome of the work of the commission, it will never serve to fully compensate those who have been so badly hurt. I hope it will go some way, however, towards offering an expression of regret.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that £4 million has been set aside for counselling and I hope the provision of this professional service will help to reduce some of the pain and stress which was endured. It will not restore a lost childhood; it might, however, lift some of the pain. I hope the Bill will establish the truth with compassion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have spoken on this Bill today. It is important legislation. There are many different issues involved which can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage. Some Deputies have concerns and reservations about individual aspects of the Bill, but I assure them that, as many of them recognised, the terms of reference are broadly drawn. On that basis they are capable of use in many different circumstances. That arose in the course of the debate, when Deputy Michael Kitt was concerned about bullying and other Deputies were also concerned that this might be included. It would fit under the terms of reference, but of course the major issues are well known and will be catered for under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised the issue of compensation for victims. This is of course a major issue which must and will be addressed. It has been suggested that the Government is trying to avoid the issue <Col N="330" /> through the establishment of a commission. The commission is necessary to provide the forum for the investigations on the one hand and the forum for the healing and listening on the other. This method of approach which the Government is using is based on the recommendations of the non-statutory commission, which has given detailed consideration to how to deal with this problem. We could look elsewhere to see what people did in other places and we could try to find the best way to set up a commission and how it should be handled. However, the Government has had that done for it by experts under Ms Justice Laffoy, who has given considerable time and attention to the issue. The Government said it accepted Ms Justice Laffoy's report in full and devised legislation based on that report and that commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>On the issue of compensation, it is important to state clearly that section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) provides that the commission's report must consider measures to alleviate the effects of abuse suffered by victims. I have already said there will be no preconditions on the commission in this area or elsewhere. The commission will be wholly independent and will report independently.</P>
    <P>It is also important to examine what victims have been saying. There is both a demand and a need for a therapeutic role for victims. As I have said, this is the prime role for the commission in dealing with victims. Effective therapy is not simply a matter of monetary compensation. This is not of course to downplay the compensation area, which must also be dealt with, but the Department has received many inquiries from people &ndash; this is carried through in the report of the commission &ndash; who want to be heard and listened to. They want the healing forum, and that is provided for at the same time.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the Statute of Limitations, which is being pursued separately in separate legislation. I note the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform undertook in the Dáil to consider the views of Opposition Deputies which were expressed strongly. In particular, he is to consider if provision can be made for victims of abuse who came forward to gardaí and were instrumental in having abusers convicted. Such cases were also raised in this debate. These people would not benefit from a change in the law because, by virtue of giving evidence against the abusers, they could not claim they were unaware of the abuse or its effects. These views are being considered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will be further considered by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying what the Minister said. <Col N="331" /> What he will do is a matter for that legislation and those discussions. He made it clear this is a matter he will consider. How he does so remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the independence of the commission and asked that the role of the State be fully examined. That is what it is all about. All the documentation is being prepared for the commission. There are two archivists working on it. They are not hiding or destroying it. I know everyone is entitled to be suspicious but we must be careful that comments are not offensive to the civil servants handling the matter at present. To my knowledge it is being done in an open and transparent way. They are going through all the documentation and there are huge numbers of general cases, not that there will be problems with all of them, to investigate, for example, any reports, letters or notes made over the period that were ignored, that is, examining what the State did or did not do. The information will be made available to the commission and to individuals who seek it. If inspectors' reports indicating there were serious problems were ignored, that information will be available to the commission.</P>
      <P>The question was raised whether the commission could go back further than 1940. It can and that is provided for in this legislation. Essentially we are talking about the period between 1940 and 1999 but the commission can decide to go outside either date. That will be clear on Committee Stage when we deal with the nuts and bolts of the Bill. The commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and that has been provided for.</P>
      <P>The commission's report will be an independent report to the people, based solely on its findings and arising from the work it has done. The Government will receive its copy. There is provision for interim reports and someone suggested having a six monthly report. However, I would rather leave it to the commission to decide when it would have material for an interim report. I do not want to put fixed requirements of that kind on the commission but it is something we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As regards expenses, section 20 is specifically designed on the commission's recommendation. We will have details of a scheme available in time for Committee Stage. The purpose is to have a sensible scheme that will meet all the needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to one member of the commission. I do not know who made the point but it was carried in <i>The Sunday Times </i>that, because the person concerned had acted in an institution in Britain, the person would not be suitable. The Department looked at this. The person concerned came with strong recommendations as a person with wide experience in the area. The person had experience as a teacher in a college of education, was deputy head of an approved school, assistant divisional director in a residential and day care facility and an assistant director and director of social services in another <Col N="332" /> borough council. The person concerned has wide experience and has acted in other capacities as honorary secretary to the Association of Directors of Social Services from 1988 to 1992 and was president from 1996 to 1997. The individual has had the highest awards in the UK. It is very easy to target people who worked in the service. We need people who know what goes on and how things work. The commission is headed by Justice Laffoy who is very experienced and has handled all these matters exceptionally well. I have no doubt she will serve the public and the State well with this statutory commission.</P>
    <P>Various questions were raised that may perhaps be better dealt with on Committee Stage. Deputy Bruton spoke about the need for a review of what is happening at present. We hope to progress the work being done. There is much change and development in the area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shortall said the definition is very good and broad. Her main concern was the statute of limitations and the culpability of the State. However, I reassure Deputies that this is addressed in the provisions of the Bill and anything that arises will be put on the table.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for legal representation and expenses are provided for, and I referred to them in my speech at the outset. Deputy Neville welcomed the broad definitions and felt they provided a great deal of scope. He was concerned about counselling and felt it should be mentioned directly in the Bill. The counselling arrangements are already in train and money has already been allocated by the Government. People have been trained specifically for this counselling, and that process is under way. This counselling will serve the commission. People asked whether counselling will be adequate. The commission will have to be satisfied that counselling is adequate and I think that decision is in good hands.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Kitt also spoke about the broad definitions in the Bill. He was concerned about boarding schools and said he would like them to be included: they are included. Deputy Creed raised the issue of the family home. In simple terms, every situation other than the family home is included, including boarding schools in so far as allegations or problems will arise. The issue of bullying was also raised and can be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed said some people would like to have abuse in the family home dealt with, but the commission has clearly stated that it wants to be focused and do a good job on the major issues which arose. It does not want to become too diffuse and spend forever without getting to the <Col N="333" /> heart of some of the key issues which directly relate to the State and the alleged negligence of the State about which Deputies and everybody else are rightly concerned. We accepted the recommendations of the non-statutory advisory group and are following them in full.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey raised the issue of travel arrangements. Generally, people think of travel arrangements for those coming from the country to the location of the commission. However, travel arrangements can cover people carrying out inquiries elsewhere, away from the central location. The inquiry officers will be supplied with resources to go wherever is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton welcomed the provision of £4 million and the broad terms of reference. I assure the Deputy that counselling is considered to be of vital importance because so many people have sought counselling in one way or another. People currently in counselling will be able to avail of that facility and service. This will have to be done to the satisfaction of the commission. Here again one can see the independence of the commission.</P>
    <P>As this opening debate on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill comes to a close, a number of things have become clear. Firstly, there is a clear commitment among Members that former residents of places charged with the care of children, especially victims of abuse in those places, should be given a full and open hearing. There is also a commitment that allegations of abuse will be fully investigated and that those responsible for abuse, either indirectly or directly, whether individuals, organisations or State bodies, will be held accountable. Finally, there is a determination that we do everything possible to try to protect the most vulnerable children and young people from the evil of child abuse, and that we do this in a sensitive and balanced way. The commission recommended the approach which is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that up to the recent past, debate about conditions in places where children were cared for, and the attitude of many in society towards children, was either non-existent or characterised by a refusal to come to terms with very harsh realities. The commission, which the Bill establishes, will take us on a journey at the end of which all of us will be better informed and those who suffered any kind of abuse will finally be given acknowledgement that they have been wronged. The commission is an important part of the process of healing and reconciliation for victims, for those who committed abuse, for those who failed in their duties, statutory or moral and for Irish society.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed so constructively to the debate and look forward to hearing further views as we continue the debate on Committee Stage. We have noted the contributions and for Committee Stage will be looking very closely at the Bill. In the course of the debate it was suggested that we might look at the <Col N="334" /> question of a tribunal, something I have noted and will consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the recently published Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In recent weeks the membership of many of the various social partner organisations, which participated both in the negotiations and conclusion of the agreement, have been engaged in consideration of its detail. Many people have been promoting acceptance while others have voiced a different opinion. It is entirely proper that such a debate occur and it is a healthy exercise for our democracy. It is vitally important that everyone understands the issues from all perspectives and that we are all clearly aware just what is at stake. We have come a long way over the past ten to 15 years and it is unthinkable that we might embark on a path now which could undermine that success.</P>
      <P>For many currently in the workforce the memory of the dark days of the mid 1980s is very distant and for many more their experience of working life has been in an environment where we have been achieving spectacular growth and building towards the economic success story that is Ireland today. However, the experience of earlier times shows that when we do not work together, when each group pursues its own narrow self-interest, everybody loses. We must learn from those earlier experiences. We must recognise that social partnership played a crucial role in shaping our recent economic development. It has done so by supporting a competitive evolution of incomes which underpinned the transformation of public finances and delivered low inflation. The consensus approach provided stability and confidence and facilitated high levels of investment and jobs growth. Through its inclusive structure, social partnership has supported an ambitious approach to social policy, especially in tackling the scourge of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all well aware of the litany of dismal statistics before social partnership took hold in 1987 so I will confine myself to just a few com<Col N="335" /> parisons. In 1987 the national debt/GNP ratio was 125%. In the decade 1977 to 1987 inflation averaged 11.7%. Public finances had reached such a point of deep crises that we came under the scrutiny of the IMF. At the end of 1999, the Government debt-GDP ratio stood at 47%, down from 49% in 1998. Inflation during the partnership years up to November 1999 averaged approximately 3%. Our public finances have reached a level of buoyancy which is unprecedented in our history.</P>
    <P>In the area of unemployment the transformation over the period of partnership has been equally as positive. More than half a million more people are in work than in 1987. The total number in employment is almost 1.7 million &ndash; the highest level in the history of the State. Since the Government took office the number of people on the live register has fallen by almost 83,000, the unemployment rate has been more than halved and the level of long-term unemployment has also fallen dramatically. According to the most recent quarterly national household survey, 2.1% of the workforce is classified as long-term unemployed, down from 5.6% in April 1997.</P>
    <P>This is progress but we are not satisfied and, in the context of the new programme, have set ourselves the target of the effective elimination of long-term unemployment over the period of the agreement. The PPF recognises our achievements and success and, through the comprehensive objectives and actions contained in its various chapters, outlines a prescription to ensure that everyone will share in the benefits of our national success. The programme is rooted in the recent NESC report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice, and is structured to complement and reflect the goals of the recently published national development plan.</P>
    <P>The programme has the capacity to transform society. It represents a further major assault on poverty and exclusion. It is important that we consider the totality of the agreement and not particular elements set apart in isolation. The programme consists of an integrated package of pay, tax and social inclusion measures and must be considered in that context. It will deliver substantial increases in incomes. A process of major restructuring of the tax system has already begun. These steps, together with the pay elements in the programme, will generate increases of 25% or more in net take home pay over its lifetime. A national minimum wage will be introduced within weeks. Widening of the tax bands and other reforms will remove substantial numbers of people from the top rate of tax while those on lower incomes, such as those at the new minimum wage level, will gradually be removed from the tax net altogether.</P>
    <P>The social inclusion and income adequacy measures envisaged by the programme come within the expenditure commitment of £1.5 billion over the period of the agreement. Some initiatives have already been set in train through <Col N="336" /> the recent budget. Improvements are being implemented in respect of retirement and old age and invalidity pensions, disability allowance, FIS and carers benefit. The programme must be viewed in the context of its broader content. The pay and social inclusion elements are critically important, but many other issues, for example, labour market, health and safety, consumer matters etc. concern the social partners and the programme is comprehensive in reflecting these issues.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on actions already under way to address some of these issues. As time is limited, I will confine my observations to some of my areas of responsibility. The PPF specifically addresses occupational safety, health and welfare. One of its stated objectives is &ldquo;to reduce the number of accidents and to underpin the joint responsibility of employers and employees in relation to the prevention of accidents in the workplace and the adoption of a health and safety culture&rdquo;. This objective encapsulates perfectly the message that I and my Government colleagues have advocated over the past three years. The reduction of accident and fatality rates in workplaces will not be brought about by prescriptive State action alone, but needs to be underpinned by ownership and partnership in order to create a truly safety conscious culture in every sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of this objective and the actions it identifies to achieve it as not only does it give a very public priority to the issue of workplace health and safety but it also gives a credibility and credence to the actions and activities which both I and the Health and Safety Authority have pursued in recent times. Three of the principal activities include the introduction of measures to tackle health and safety in the high risk construction sector, an exploration of the broader health, safety and welfare issues facing our workforce and the initiation of a full review of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I launched a radical new partnership initiative, the construction safety partnership plan, which is designed to tackle safety in the construction sector. Last October I brought both sides of industry together under the auspices of the construction safety partnership agreement and this safety plan is the result of four months of intensive deliberations between all sides in an effort to find ways of bringing about real improvement in safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. I particularly welcome the deliberate emphasis throughout the plan on proper safety representation, safety consultation and adequate training for workers and managers. The recommendations concerning these aspects will not only be taken on board by the social partners, but will also be underpinned by legislation.</P>
    <P>The construction sector is fundamental to Ireland's social and economic infrastructure and will continue to be so in the context of the NDP, <Col N="337" /> in addition to the building of the national sports stadium and the development of the LUAS light rail system. There is no doubt that the construction sector will continue to boom, but it cannot continue if it costs the lives or health of those who work in the sector. It is ten years since the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act was passed and in that time health and safety has become a legitimate business issue. A full picture of the most pertinent health and safety issues is available and this is the ideal position from which to move forward. I have already requested a full review of the Act and I am pleased that the PPF acknowledges the importance and significance of such a review. It will be an indepth review which will draw on all the experiences of the past ten years and will be an opportunity to strengthen and update our health and safety provisions where necessary, as well as laying the foundation for future decades of health and safety practices in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the section of the programme directed at enhancing workplace relations through partnership for competitive enterprises. Essentially, this commitment will ensure that we translate our successful national partnership approach to the level of the individual enterprise. In addition, I welcome the opportunity for us to develop and deepen our understanding of the new workplace issues which impact on workers' well-being in both physical and psychological terms. There are major issues outside the physical working environment which must be addressed and I am pleased the programme recognises that.</P>
    <P>I turn to insurance costs, which come under the remit of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Treacy. Thanks to previous national agreements, in particular Partnership 2000, this issue was a matter of concern not only because of the cost issue but also because of the safety dimension. The social partners have committed themselves in the programme to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. As part of this commitment, the workplace safety group, which enjoys the support of the HSA and the social partners, is promoting a workplace safety code on safe working and accident prevention.</P>
    <P>The McAuley group has completed its work on examining alternative systems for delivery of personal injury compensation and will report shortly to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Treacy. The group's proposals will be examined by the Government in the light of the agreement in framework 1 of the programme to examine alternatives to the present cumbersome system of personal injury compensation.</P>
    <P>On the question of consumer law, the directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distant contracts &ndash; Directive 97/7/EC &ndash; is due to be transposed into national law this year. It is designed to protect consumers who enter into distant contracts, whether through e-commerce, teleshopping or some other form of distance selling. The directive, which covers goods and most <Col N="338" /> services but not financial services, provides that before a contract is concluded, the consumer must be provided with certain information which is considered essential to enable him or her to make an informed choice, including the identity of the supplier, the main characteristics of the goods or services, the price of the goods or services etc.</P>
    <P>The directive also provides that, in general, the consumer will have a right of withdrawal from a distance contract for a specified period. There will be a prohibition on the supply of goods or services to consumers without them being ordered beforehand. The directive will provide consumers who wish to engage in distance contracts with an appropriate legal framework to protect their interests against the background of the growth in cross-Border trade in the Single Market. In the spirit of the PPF, there will be full consultation with interested parties, including consumer and business interests during the transposition process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, with regard to labour market activities, that the agreement recognises the twin issues of labour shortages and social inclusion and that the partners will engage in an appraisal of active labour market programmes to ensure that they reflect the radically different labour market scenario now compared to the problems of high unemployment which plagued us not so long ago.</P>
    <P>The emphasis now is on providing an adequate supply of labour, both in terms of numbers and skills, to meet market needs and on providing the individual with the necessary skills and training to improve his or her employability and take advantage of the opportunities in the market.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest and most expensive such programmes is community employment and the Government is committed to ensuring that people on this scheme will benefit by progressing to market employment. I hope that, given the buoyant economy, the numbers of people dependent on the scheme will fall automatically. To reflect current circumstances in the labour market, the Government is already committed to reducing the numbers on community employment to 28,000 by 2003.</P>
    <P>To continue to provide important services in disadvantaged communities and in doing so to generate employment, a new social economy programme is under way, as set out in the agreement, funded mainly through the savings on CE. The new agreement has also decided that the partners will examine the implications of other essential services such as school caretakers and classroom assistants which are currently provided through the CE scheme.</P>
    <P>Forthcoming legislation in the labour law area includes the implementation of the EU directives on part-time and fixed term work. I intend to publish a Bill to implement the part-time work directive by June of this year. The fixed term work directive will be implemented by July 2001. The purpose of the new part-time work legis<Col N="339" /> lation will be to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers. It has been apparent for some time that a growing number of people in the workforce are employed in alternative work to the traditional full-time job. Action in this area is very timely, given the increase in new types of flexible working patterns, especially part-time work. The major benefit of part-time work in businesses is that it provides flexibility, allowing the employer to respond to increased competition and the changing demands of customers. It is important, however, that employees in these flexible work situations are not discriminated against and that they must receive treatment which is comparable to that given to permanent full-time employees. Part-time workers tend to be concentrated in sectors requiring low levels of skills with poor pay and prospects, and such employees must be provided with the appropriate protection.</P>
    <P>I also intend to introduce a carer's leave Bill which will allow employees to leave their employment temporarily for a period up to 15 months to provide full-time care for older people or people with disabilities in need of full-time care and attention. Such employees will have their employment rights protected during this leave.</P>
    <P>The society in which we live has to face demographic changes and the aging of its population with, as a consequence, an increasing number of employees &ndash; estimated at up to 5% in Europe &ndash; having to take time off work to provide care for parents, relations or friends, and especially the elderly. People in need of such care here traditionally were cared for within the family. However, the decline in family sizes, the increased numbers of people living alone and the increasing participation of women in the labour force all have impacted on the numbers and willingness of family members to provide such care.</P>
    <P>The provision of carer's leave, together with the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme announced by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in the budget and included in the Social Welfare Bill, will help to facilitate and support employees who wish to leave the workforce temporarily to care for a parent or relative. It is proposed to commence the legislation simultaneously with the carer's benefit scheme in October 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government has faithfully and fully implemented the terms of Partnership 2000. It is fully committed to the principles of social partnership and is already engaged in actions as agreed in the new programme. It is vitally important that everyone recognises that we live in a competitive world. We cannot be complacent. Our continued success depends on our ability to cope with the competitive challenges of the international marketplace and clearly social partnership can give us the edge needed to cope with those challenges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Four partnership agreements have helped to bring us to prosperity and economic success. This programme is all about deepening and sharing that success. The alternative is a return to the formula of the early 1980s. That approach was abandoned for a very good reason &ndash; it did not work. We, together, have devised a process that not only works but has been spectacularly successful. What long-term advantages can be achieved for us all by adopting a different path?</P>
    <P>I have heard this programme called everything from a partnership for peace to a programme for happiness. I am convinced that it will provide peace with regard to industrial relations and I am confident it will provide happiness for our workforce throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to conclude the debate on the new national agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, Ireland has done extremely well in recent years and is continuing to prosper economically. The resources are now available, as never before, to begin building the Ireland of the 21st century to achieve further prosperity for all of our people, and to promote equity and fairness in society. We have seen the transformation of Ireland's economic position during the 1990s, with Irish living standards now fast approaching the average across the EU. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness represents the continuance of a winning formula. We have the confidence and the means through this programme to achieve substantial further progress.</P>
      <P>The new programme has been strongly praised by many Deputies and I note that there has been general support for the social partnership approach. The previous national agreements since 1987 are generally acknowledged to have made a substantial contribution to the overall economic climate and to confidence in the Irish economy. These agreements have been central to the economic stability which has been an essential prerequisite for employment growth and improvement in living standards.</P>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the objectives of the programme relate both to economic and social progress. The programme sits alongside the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium and the national development plan. It is also informed by the social and economic vision for the Ireland of the 21st century, which is set out in the recent NESC strategy report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is a comprehensive package, including the pay agreement and an integrated set of economic and social objectives and related action plans. These are set out under five headings &ndash; improving living standards, furthering prosperity and economic inclusion, achieving social inclusion and equality; adapting success<Col N="341" /> fully to continuing change and renewing partnership.</P>
    <P>The programme aims to ensure that the conditions are provided for further sustainable economic and social development and that the benefits of economic progress are shared by all our people, that real, tangible improvements are brought about in living standards, not only in terms of income but in other areas affecting the quality of people's lives, such as housing and transport, and that, in a rapidly changing world, we are in a position to play to our strengths and positively embrace the challenges posed by changes in, for example, information technology, globalisation and the enlargement of the EU.</P>
    <P>The central policy goals of the programme can be summarised in terms of stabilisation, growth and social inclusion. Given our EMU membership, stability oriented policies are vital to achieve these outcomes in the increasingly globalised and integrated international economy.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the introduction to the programme, it is based on the achievement of an average annual GNP growth rate of about 5.6% over the period to 2002, and a goal of maintaining significant budgetary surpluses in each year. Maintaining budgetary surpluses in each year is designed to achieve a further reduction in national indebtedness, to free up further resources to sustain public policies into the longer term and to facilitate the pursuit of key social and economic objectives.</P>
    <P>Social inclusion was pursued as an integral part of the last national programme, Partnership 2000. The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, as its name implies, seeks to consolidate and build upon the many advances made in combating social exclusion during the partnership agreement now concluding. As the Taoiseach said at the launch of the programme, social justice, together with stabilisation and growth, are the key goals upon which the new programme is founded. It contains key objectives in the social inclusion and equality areas and is backed by a £1.5 billion commitment of resources to enable them to be implemented. It represents a considerable demonstration of the priority the Government attaches to ensuring that the fruits of our new found prosperity will be shared among all our people.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package included in the recent budget was, by some considerable distance, the largest ever provided. The additional resources now being envisaged over the period to 2003 will facilitate further improvements in the coming years. In the central area of income adequacy, the real value of social welfare payments will be maintained and, where possible, enhanced in the context of making substantial progress over the period of the agreement towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare. For pensioners, the agreement confirms that the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments <Col N="342" /> given in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets the target of eliminating long-term unemployment and ensuring that it does not recur. This is an aim which could not realistically have been contemplated even a few years ago. The elimination of long-term unemployment is important not only because of the benefits which accrue to individuals, their families and to society as a whole, but also because our continued economic growth requires us to mobilise available sources of labour. We have a large number of labour market programmes aimed at the unemployed, the bulk of which were put in place when unemployment was much higher and the prospects for the unemployed much poorer than they are now. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commits the social partners to re-orient these labour market programmes towards training programmes to reflect the current labour market and the benefits to the individual of such interventions.</P>
    <P>These measures will be complemented by the development of policies and measures in the area of lifelong learning. Under the programme, the promotion of education and training, is afforded considerable priority. A range of initiatives are set out under the heading of lifelong learning, designed to promote an educational culture in the work place. The programme advocates enhanced skills development at all levels of the workforce to facilitate labour market adaptability in response to rapid technological and structural change. This approach is intended to yield increased productivity to support competitiveness and employment policies. It will also help to ensure that the labour force of the future will be sufficiently skilled and educated to adapt to a constantly changing and competitive environment.</P>
    <P>Child poverty is something which no decent society can tolerate. In providing a record £105 million for improvements in the child benefit in the December budget, we demonstrated, in the most effective way possible, the priority which the Government attaches to its alleviation and, more importantly, its elimination. In giving a priority focus towards a £100 per month payment for third and subsequent children during the course the agreement, the Government is underpinning the provision for a substantially increased level of child income support.</P>
    <P>This partnership agreement is not only about pay, taxation and the promotion of economic development. It is also a social contract to promote fairness and eliminate discrimination in our society. Under the programme, the social partners have committed themselves to the creation of a fair and inclusive society. To achieve this, a considerable number of action points have been specified in areas such as disability, gender and equality proofing. In addition, a number of institutions have been established such as the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of <Col N="343" /> Equality Investigations and the National Disability Authority.</P>
    <P>On child care, the programme recognises that the national development plan provides for a major enhancement of funding for child care. Some £250 million will be spent by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the seven year period of the plan with a view to assisting the private and voluntary sectors to increase the number of child care places and to improve the quality of care provided. I am reminded of the need to ensure our crèche is provided and I am happy to say planning permission is being sought at present. This money will be spent in a number of ways, such as the provision of capital grants and staffing supports for community based child care facilities, capital grants for private child care providers, training supports, developmental supports for national voluntary child care organisations and the development of local child care networks. The development of family-friendly policies is also important to allow parents and carers reconcile the, at times, conflicting demands of family and working life. The programme states that a review of maternity protection legislation has commenced and that the operation of the Paternal Leave Act will also be reviewed in consultation with the social partners. The social partners have also committed themselves to further support and facilitate the development of appropriately designed family-friendly policies at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness pays particular attention to the position of the low paid, a point everybody in this House welcomes. It contains an agreed objective of the removal from the tax net of those earning less than the proposed national minimum wage. There here has been some criticism of the rate of £4.40 for the minimum wage and the proposed phased increases to £4.70 and £5.00 over the period of the programme. The Government gave careful consideration in deciding on the minimum rate and was concerned to achieve the right balance between protecting the interests of vulnerable groups and the maintenance of employment and competitiveness. I would also point out, in this connection, that the Finance Bill confirms the £1 billion in personal tax reductions in the budget which will remove over 70,000 low paid taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
    <P>Tax reform has been a key element of the approach to partnership since 1987. By virtue of the previous national agreements, the agreed pay increases with significant reductions in personal taxation have delivered substantial increases in net take home pay for all workers over the period of partnership. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness continues this approach. Under the programme's period of 33 months, take home pay of workers is set to increase by up to 25% or more, a truly remarkable figure when the taxation and pay elements are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The main aspects of the tax measures set out <Col N="344" /> in the programme indicate that the Government and the social partners regard increases in tax credits and the development of the tax credit system as the priority areas for resources over the course of the programme.</P>
    <P>The entire package is carefully constructed to achieve a balanced outcome. For the Government, as for other employers, it provides a degree of certainty about the development of the pay bill over the period of the agreement, is conducive to stability and industrial peace and advances the process of public service modernisation.</P>
    <P>There has been some concern expressed recently about the pay terms of the programme in the light of recent reported trends in inflation. The inflation figures have been mainly due to external factors, such as increased oil prices and the fall in the value of the euro, a topic I dealt with at some length in the House recently. While acknowledging these factors, it is fair to say that most reasonable commentators are inclined to the view that inflation is likely to average about 2% to 2.5% over the period 2000 to 2002.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises the vital importance of international competitiveness for Ireland's continuing economic and social progress. The enhancement of competitiveness is an overarching objective of the programme. The measures contained in the programme are designed to strengthen each of the main enterprise sectors, including small business and the services sector, promote indigenous industry including agriculture, agri-food, marine and forestry, address skills shortages and accelerate e-commerce infrastructure and the information society.</P>
    <P>There are no guarantees of plain sailing. Ireland, as a small open economy, is vulnerable to external economic shocks. Events in countries and areas of the world that may seem to be very remote geographically can have significant adverse affects on our economy. That said, I remain very optimistic in relation to Ireland's economic prospects. The agreement, if implemented in the spirit of partnership in which it was conceived, will contribute to our future success and be conducive to further prosperity for all our people. As with previous agreements, it will be vital that all of us within each of the pillars of the social partnership play our part in ensuring the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>I commend the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the House. It is a remarkable document and one which looks to secure the future for our young people which is what the business of Government should always be about. We must make sure we leave a legacy from which future generations can benefit and so that they can enjoy an Ireland which has not been seen since the foundation of the State. This programme contributes enormously to that process.</P>

      <Quest>the method in which parents' views of the whole school evaluation pilot scheme have been collected by his Department.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7258/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): A consultative conference on whole school evaluation, WSE, took place in March 1996, at which initial proposals for WSE were discussed with all the partners, including representatives of the National Parents Councils, primary and post-primary parents and other partners were invited to make written submissions in response to the initial proposals.</P>
    <P>Meetings were subsequently held between the inspectorate of my Department and each of the partners to elaborate on the proposals, to clarify the responses and to discuss arrangements for a collaborative pilot exercise on WSE. From these detailed discussions and from an examination of the written submissions, a WSE pilot project was developed and implemented in 35 primary and second level schools in 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>As part of the WSE pilot process, parents, in their capacities as members of the board of management, were consulted by the inspectors at the pre-evaluation and post-evaluation meetings held in each participating school.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the pilot phase, a draft report was prepared by the inspectorate which considered the findings of the pilot exercise, including recommendations and suggestions made by the participating schools and by other partners, including parents. This draft report was circulated to all the partners and to the participating schools. A further series of consultations took place between the inspectorate and each of the partners to discuss their reactions to the draft report. The partners were invited to make further written submissions if they so wished.</P>
    <P>A final report on the WSE pilot project, which took account of the latest round of consultations, was then circulated to all partners and to all schools in November 1999. A draft circular on WSE is in preparation and this will be circulated to all partners, including parents, for their consideration. The views of all partners will be taken into account before the final issue of the circular to schools.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that a detailed questionnaire was issued on the whole school evaluation pilot project but that parents were excluded from it in that there was no survey of their views? With regard to the Minister's comment that parents as a body in a school were not consulted as part of the evaluation and did not receive any outcome of the evaluation, given that parents are the primary educators of their chil<Col N="346" /> dren, does he agree that they should not have been excluded in this way from the evaluation of schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of parents in the whole school evaluation process was given a good deal of consideration. Given the existing developments of the parents' role at school level and the empowerment of parents and parental groups at national level, the final report of the WSE pilot project emphasised the need to explore the best means of incorporating the perspective of parents in the evaluation process.</P>
      <P>The WSE report considered that ways should be found in which parents could be given the opportunity to express their views through questionnaires and through meetings with a wider range of groups, such as parents' associations or parents' councils in schools.</P>
      <P>A draft circular letter on WSE is in preparation and will be circulated to all the partners for their views before it is issued in the final form. The purpose of the circular letter will be to mainstream WSE in primary and second level schools. The circular will provide for the involvement of parent representatives in the whole school evaluation process.</P>

      <P>Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs. Information on the number of Montessori teachers who work in primary schools is not readily available and I have asked my officials to correspond directly with the Deputy in relation to this.</P>
      <P>The Montessori teachers who are entitled to restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification, which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, who have successfully completed the diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Montessori teachers are not currently recognised as fully qualified primary teachers and, in the circumstances, are not entitled to take up permanent posts in mainstream schools or posts as remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Issues related to the training and qualifications of primary school teachers are kept under review. At present the existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed. A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review, it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers and for remedial teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim I am satisfied that the Montessori teachers who are recognised by my Depart<Col N="348" /> ment are well qualified to teach in the settings for which they are currently recognised and I am unaware of any decline in teaching standards in these areas.</P>

The best indicator of this is that while the number of applications for special arrangements has increased from just over 2000 in 1994 to more than 3000 in 1998, each year no more than 30 appeals are made to the special arrangements appeal group. This group exists to provide for an appeal in cases where a student is dissatisfied with some or all of the arrangements proposed.</P>
      <P>Essentially, requests for special arrangements have been rejected where the granting of the arrangement sought would confer an unfair advantage on the individual candidate or compromise the integrity of examinations.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that figures have been issued under the Freedom of Information Act to suggest that around 500 pupils received special arrangements? Using the Minister's figure, does that not imply that more than 80% of applications for special arrangements are refused?</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy the number of appeals that take place. There may be cases where no appeals were made and there is no record of those applications. The number I gave is of cases where appeals have been made. There will be an improvement in special arrangements this year when, for the first time, each leaving certificate candidate will have the option of availing of up to 20 minutes extra time in the subjects of Irish, English, History and Geography. This year there will be an option for a special needs candidate to request a waiver of a component of the examination. By way of example, it will be possible for a special needs candidate not to do the oral component of a language examination, and not to be penalised in the marking.</P>
      <P>Also for the first time this year, candidates' requests for special arrangements will be dealt with under a set of principles put in place following the independent expert review. In addition, this year an aggrieved candidate, or his or her parent, can appeal to an independent appeal group in the event of not being satisfied.</P>

      <P>That sort of waffle is all very well, but I asked a simple question. I wanted to know how many were rejected. Is it not the case that the Minister allowed only 500 out of 130,000 pupils to have special arrangements? That suggests that special needs students comprise less than 0.5% of children. We know the extent of learning disability that requires special arrangements is far beyond that. Is it not the case that every application for special arrangements is accompanied by detailed submissions from the school principal and a psychologist, and that the Department is rejecting four out of every five of those applications?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he has assessed the size of the gap between the higher education maintenance grant and the cost of supporting a student in college; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third level college. The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>For the 1999-2000 academic year, the rates of maintenance grants payable are set at £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate, and £676 at the adjacent rate. In relation to the value of the grant, I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year. I also intend to continue the practice in recent years of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I would point out that 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year. Furthermore, the position of mature students in general, and independent mature students in particular, has also been addressed under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the school which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower rate. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for <Col N="351" /> disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grant schemes. My officials are developing proposals for my consideration in relation to these financial supports and I will announce the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but he could have saved his breath and said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It was a simple question. Why has the Minister not assessed the size of the gap between the higher education maintenance grant and the cost of living? Is it not a fact that the consumer price index excludes the cost of rent? In recent years rents in Dublin and other cities have risen by 100% but that is not being taken into consideration in maintenance grant increases. Given that fact, does the Minister believe that a 2% to 3% increase in the maintenance grant is adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach the Government has taken in relation to the market generally and the rental situation in particular, is to provide tax incentives which will be effective in providing additional accommodation. Expenditure on maintenance grants for 1999 under the three third level schemes amounted to approximately £63.5 million.</P>
      <P>The Government has targeted people in areas of disadvantage and is providing additional funds to tackle disadvantage and access for people from those areas. Decisions in relation to this and an additional £95 million will be forthcoming in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the question I asked? Why is this not being assessed? Is it not a fact that the average cost for a student outside Dublin living in the capital is £5,000? Is it not true that the consumer price index does not include rent? On the Minister's point on tax incentives, the current grant is approximately £1,600 while the price of student accommodation in on-campus residences in UCC can be as much as £1,943, with a 7% increase in the coming year, while in NUI Galway such accommodation costs £2,254. The grant does not cover the cost of accommodation, never mind the additional expense of keeping a student in college.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken to overcome the weakness of the remedial education programme identified in the Educational Research Centre's study of the programme in primary schools.</Quest>

      <P>The Study of Remedial Education in Irish primary schools identified a number of weaknesses in the delivery of remedial education at primary level and made certain recommendations to bring about improvements. A number of steps have already been taken to address the weaknesses identified.</P>
      <P>The summary report of the study has been issued to all schools. Principals were requested to convene a meeting with their remedial teachers, staff and boards of management to discuss the content of the report and the steps they should take at school level to implement the recommendations. The report was also given to the directors of all courses organised for remedial teachers. In this way the findings and recommendations of the report are now part of the training of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>The remedial teaching service has been extended to every primary school in the country. There are now 1,465 full-time remedial teaching posts in primary schools. Action has also been taken on the recommendation to have the Guidelines on Remedial Education revised. The revised guidelines will soon be ready for issue to schools and will ensure that there is clarity about the aims of remedial education and about the population of pupils for whom it is intended. Innovations in best practice have been incorporated in this revision.</P>
      <P>Particular attention has been focused in the revised guidelines on the needs of schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage. Recommendations in regard to these schools are highlighted throughout the revision. In addition, the revised guidelines incorporate good practice from particular programmes such as Reading Recovery and Success for All, which have been successful in other countries.</P>
      <P>In 1999, £500,000 was allocated to assist school development planning in these schools. This has been increased to £750,000 in the current year. An important focus of this planning is to address the needs of pupils with serious literacy and other learning difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>In December 1998 all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 for the purchase of library books, with schools in designated areas of edu<Col N="353" /> cational disadvantage receiving an additional £2,170 each. Furthermore, in October 1999 a minimum grant of £462 was issued to schools with 60 pupils or fewer for the purchase of library books, while schools with in excess of 60 pupils received a <i>per capita</i> grant of £7.70. These grants, along with the general improvements in the staffing of primary schools, the introduction of the revised curriculum in English, which has a major emphasis on the development of literacy skills, and the training which teachers are now receiving in regard to the revised English curriculum will be of major benefit in raising reading standards.</P>
    <P>In addition, teachers will be provided with the Drumcondra English profiles to assist them in developing reading programmes at individual, class and school levels. The profiles will be distributed to schools during the current school year. The use of these profiles should lead to earlier and more objective identification of pupils with special reading needs and ultimately to the prevention of reading problems.</P>
    <P>The national reading initiative launched in January is a national effort to tackle the problem of poor reading achievements and to promote reading generally. The initiative acknowledges that the problem of low achievement and underachievement is not just a school-based problem. It stresses the importance of parents encouraging their children, by reading to them to develop their vocabulary and imagination and by listening to them read.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister read this report? Does he accept that responding to this is not about school meetings and guidelines? It is about resources. Is the Minister aware that 85% of children who needed remedial intervention in mathematics got none and that 25% of children who needed remedial intervention in reading got none? Is he aware that in disadvantaged schools there was no apparent improvement in the relative position of children after two years of remediation? Will he make a clear commitment to proper reform in this area and proper resourcing? The situation is that disadvantaged schools have almost three times the national average for early school leaving and have almost double the national average for serious literacy problems. The Minister's response to these findings is hopelessly inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, teachers may depart from teaching on either a permanent <Col N="355" /> or a temporary basis. Permanent departures are comprised largely of retirements while those of a temporary nature are, for the most part, made up of career breaks. The position with regard to permanent departures is that 868 of the teachers on my Department's payroll retired from teaching in 1998 and 887 retired in 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition to these retirements, approximately 450 teachers departed on career break in each of those years. A career break may last for a period of up to five years and, from available evidence, the majority of teachers return to teaching at the end of the career break. Some of those who resign at the end of the career break return to teaching in later life. Occasionally, teachers who retire on a voluntary basis before reaching compulsory retirement age will also return to teaching.</P>
      <P>An indicator of the numbers of teachers who resigned from the profession before reaching pensionable age, currently age 55, and who did not take up pensionable employment in another arm of the public service can be derived from the numbers who apply for the payment of a preserved pension. A preserved pension may be payable from the age of 60 years. In 1998, 47 preserved pensions were awarded, in addition to the 868 pensions awarded because of current retirements, and in 1999, 65 preserved pensions were awarded, in addition to the 887 pensions awarded because of current retirements.</P>

In the 2000-01 academic year it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Some 1,900 will graduate in 2000-01 as against 291 in 1995. A great deal of work has been done to increase the numbers of teachers coming on stream.</P>

Is it true that apart from the numbers retiring there is an attrition rate of close to 5% of teachers taking career breaks or other opportunities? Is it correct that if this trend continues over a period of five years it will represent the loss of more than a quarter of the teaching complement? Does this not indicate a looming problem in relation to teaching as an attractive profession for people who are very sought after elsewhere in the economy?</P>

      <P>The fundamental objective of the Children Bill, 1999, is to achieve a major advance in the quality and efficiency of the State's response to children with special care needs and those coming into conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based on the principle that the imposition of custodial sentences on children should be a matter of last resort. In support of this principle, the Bill provides for a comprehensive range of diversionary measures and non-custodial sanctions which may be availed of by the courts as an alternative to imposing custodial sentences. A key objective will be to ensure that appropriate early intervention takes place so that the child receives the assistance he or she requires before the difficulties become so serious as to warrant court intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is unfortunately the case that for some children the imposition of a custodial sentence will continue to be the required response. <Col N="357" /> Under the Bill, the custodial facilities operated under my Department will be required to cater for all such children, including those who are deemed to be unruly or depraved and those who have serious psychiatric or behavioural difficulties. Up to now, the juvenile detention centres could apply to the courts to have children who were deemed to be unruly or depraved transferred to the adult prison system. It is also the case that the centres do not currently have the facilities or the specialist expertise required to cater for children with serious psychiatric or behavioural problems.</P>
    <P>In order to meet its obligations under the Children Bill, my Department has embarked on a major five year development plan. This plan, which has an estimated overall cost of £21 million, envisages the development of an additional 24 places for young male offenders and an additional eight places for young female offenders. This extra provision is intended to meet the anticipated requirements of the courts for custodial places, including places for children requiring specialised support. The plan also involves a major refurbishment of some of the existing custodial facilities to ensure they meet the highest standards of care in a suitably secure environment.</P>
    <P>The process of implementing the development plan is already under way. In 1999, a new pre-release unit capable of catering for up to eight young male offenders was opened at the Finglas Children's Centre. Expenditure on this development amounted to £360,000. In the current year, funding of £4.7 million has been made available to progress work on the development plan. Additional funding will be made available over the period of the plan to ensure its effective implementation in line with requirements arising under the Children Bill.</P>

How many of the 32 places will be detention places and how many will be remand places?</P>

Additional funding will be made available over the period of the plan to ensure its effective implementation in line with the requirements arising under the Bill. Major refurbishment work was carried out in 1999 at Lusk at a cost of £600,000. The £4.7 million will be used to provide the initial phase of construction on the proposed new facilities. It will be used to complete planning and design work, to commence the initial phase of construction on the proposed new facilities at Oberstown campus and <Col N="358" /> the refurbishment of Finglas Children's Centre. The Oberstown campus currently houses Trinity House Reformatory School, Oberstown Boys' Centre and Oberstown Girls' Centre. This is where the additional work will be carried out. There will be phased replacement of the existing outdated facilities at St. Michael's Remand Centre in Finglas.</P>

      <P>In relation to the overall retention rate in the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81%, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report is nearing completion. The study will consider a range of factors as to their effect on completion rates such as socio-economic factors, entry requirements, time of enrolment, availability of repeat examinations and the transition from second to third level education.</P>
      <P>The council of directors of institutes of technology has also commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes and the research project team is in the process of collating the necessary data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two-year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the institute which is a similar and comparable study to that commissioned by the council of directors <Col N="359" /> of institutes of technology. The above studies are being funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to this I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a database on attrition-drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The council of directors of the institutes of technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for institutes' students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile has been made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>Institutes of technology continue to introduce a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion in the technological sector. This funding supports and complements the programmes already in place and has regard to the recommendations of the national committee on retention in relation to the funding of action projects-programmes, both short and long-term based on best practice. In addition, £8 of the student services charge collected in institutes of technology is being dedicated to projects linked to attrition and access.</P>
    <P>Through these initiatives the institutes are developing their strategies and from this year a dedicated member of staff is being assigned to work with students and staff to develop mechanisms aimed at improving retention rates. Considerable work is also being done in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and with the post-primary inspectorate in my Department to develop other positive actions in this area. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

I presume the survey was based on looking at what had happened to that cohort of people over the period. The Educational Research Centre was much more concerned at the reasons for non-completion, on which it has conducted a number of studies. Policies would be based on those reasons.</P>

      <P>A total of £74 million has been provided in the national development plan for the implementation of the proposals in the White Paper, Ready to Learn. The focus of the White Paper is on maintaining and enhancing the quality of pre-school education provision, regardless of the setting &ndash; school, home or other setting &ndash; in which the education and care are provided. The White Paper focuses in particular on increasing participation among the priority groups &ndash; children who are educationally disadvantaged and children with disabilities &ndash; and addresses the issue of direct provision where there are gaps in provision.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a process of consultation on the White Paper. I expect that this process will commence shortly. Details of expenditure on the White Paper proposals, including the direct and indirect provision of places, must await the completion of the consultation and planning process.</P>

      <P>Yes. A Green Paper is generally a discussion document, a White Paper contains proposals for policy or for legislation or for development. After that comes the actual decisions. There are three different phases. A total of £74 million is provided in the national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper proposals over the period 2000 to 2006. This figure is inclusive of funding for existing programmes &ndash; Early Start Programme, pilot pre-school project, Rutland Street pre-school project, pre-schools for Traveller children and pilot pre-school provision for autistic children. The £74 million also includes funding for the additional measures encompassed in the White Paper. Proposed allocations for these measures under the national development plan over the next three years are included.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Higher Education Authority report was suppressed by the previous Minister in his Department? It has been in the Department for more than six months and printed for more than three months. It has been deliberately suppressed because it recommends that the project in Skibbereen should go ahead. Will the Minister explain why the report has not been published in the normal way? Will he give a commitment to honour the Government decision of three years ago, as his predecessor and his Leader have done?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that in relation to the school transport scheme the safety of pupils is of primary consideration and takes precedence over all other aspects of the operation. The safety standard of vehicles used for the scheme is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. The age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann's bus fleet was refurbished during the summer of 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a road worthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual road worthiness test. All school transport vehicles are also subject to regular inspection by Bus Éireann inspectors to ensure their reliability is maintained throughout the year. I am satisfied that there are adequate checks in place to ensure the safety of the vehicles used to provide the school transport scheme.</P>

        <b>:</b> I do not know who wrote that reply for the Minister but it is totally inaccurate. Has the Minister ever stood inside a school bus? Does he realise that most of the vehicles in use in rural Ireland are clapped out buses from Bus Éireann's commercial fleet, that a considerable number of them are 25 year old imports from Singapore, that in many of them diesel is leaking from the engine and water through the roof, that there are air extractors instead of heating which makes them prone to condensation, that many of them have no speedometers, that the engine is located beside the driver and is more like a jet turbine which makes it impossible for the driver to hear what is happening at the back of the bus, and that we will shortly be confronted with school bus driver deafness claims? How can he defend a situation where buses are constantly breaking down? Last week, for example, two people had to transport replacement batteries daily by Land Rover from Ballina to Claremorris. Why does the Minister not face reality&mdash;</P>

It is my information that Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks. If the Deputy is aware of particular cases where this is not happening the Minister of State with responsibility for the scheme will have them looked into. Bus Éireann's policy of continuous fleet replacement will facilitate the improvement of the quality of the vehicles used in the operation of the school transport scheme and provide a better standard of service for pupils availing of school transport.</P>

      <P>The dissemination of the substance misuse prevention education programme for primary schools, Walk Tall, commenced in January 1999. The target was to disseminate the programme to primary schools generally over a period of two years. At the end of February 2000 the programme had been introduced to approximately 1,470 primary schools, 45% of the total number. The dissemination process continues during the current year. The process will be reviewed in May and if it appears that the target needs to be revised it is my intention that provision will be made to continue the dissemination in 2001 to ensure all primary schools will have the opportunity to introduce the programme. The implementation of the Walk Tall programme was evaluated independently during its two year development phase in 26 primary schools. As the evaluation outcomes were positive it was decided to introduce the programme to primary schools generally.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level the substance misuse prevention education programme, On My Own Two Feet, had been introduced in approximately 570 second level schools, representing 75% of the total, by the end of 1999. The dissemination of this programme commenced in early 1995 and has continued each year since. No particular target timescale was set for the dissemination of this programme to post-primary schools generally. The implementation of the On My Own Two Feet programme was evaluated independently during its development phase in a small group of post-primary schools. As the outcome of this evaluation was positive it was decided to introduce the programme to post-primary schools generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feedback from schools availing of the Walk Talk and On My Own Two Feet programmes is favourable in terms of meeting student needs and the value of the in-service training support provided. Following on a report from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment it is intended that social, personal and health education, including substance misuse prevention, will be phased in as part of the core curriculum at junior cycle over a three year period. While, on the basis of experience to date, <Col N="369" /> these programmes are succeeding, I agree that they need to be reviewed at regular intervals.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware, in terms of drug use among teenagers, Ireland has gone to the top of the European league having been bottom in the 1980s. Seventeen per cent of 14 and 15 year olds have used drugs in the last month while over 34% of all teenagers have used them. Against this background has the Minister conducted any surveys of children in schools where this programme is being put in place to obtain their views on its relevance? I have done spot checks in schools in my constituency to find remarkable disinterest in its quality. The Minister said that the outcome of the evaluation was positive. What outcomes will he be measuring and when does he expect to report back to the House on the performance of the programme based on those outcome indicators?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The independent evaluation of the Walk Tall programme was carried out by Dr. Mark Morgan of St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra. He has conducted evaluations and survey work both for the ESRI and the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Dr. Morgan's major conclusions were that the rationale for the programme was in line with what was regarded as effective approaches in other countries and that the programme itself was suitable for use with children generally. He also concluded that teachers found that the resource materials were very satisfactory and that the training and other support provided was satisfactory also.</P>
      <P>The development of On My Own Two Feet was evaluated independently by Dr. Morgan. His conclusions were broadly similar to those outlined for Walk Tall. However, having conducted a comparative study of post-primary students participating in the programme and of a control group not participating, he concluded that the participating students had significantly less favourable attitudes to the recreational use of substances than the non-participating students. The longer-term influences of programmes such as these are not known. There are many changing social and cultural influences outside the schools.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is remarkable that while teachers were asked if they were happy with the programme, students were not asked how they found them? Would he agree that in an area related to the behaviour of individual students, the key views are those of the pupils at whose behaviour the programme is directed? Would he, therefore, undertake proper surveys of the reaction and attitude of students to the programmes which are in place? People are rightly fearful of the present levels of drug use among teenagers in Ireland. They have rocketed <Col N="370" /> to the top of the European league. That is a worrying trend and it seems there is a need for a more serious effort to address this from the viewpoint of students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 146 juvenile offenders were in the care of the special residential schools for juvenile offenders operating under my Department on 3 March 2000. Of these children, 44 had been in residential care in the schools on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Planned programmes of care and education are developed for each child placed in the juvenile offender facilities. The programmes in question include elements to prepare the child for re-entry into the community following completion of his or her sentence. Children are not released from a juvenile offender facility without a discharge plan being put in place. Such plans provide for discharge on the basis that the child returns to his or her family or relatives or to a hostel or some other suitable supportive environment. Efforts are also made to enrol the children on FÁS courses or to arrange some other suitable employment or training placement. The Probation and Welfare Service works closely with the juvenile offender schools in making such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Arrangements also exist whereby juvenile offenders approaching the end of their sentences can be allowed temporary release to participate in training courses or to take up arranged employment on a supervised basis. This process can contribute towards a successful re-integration of the juvenile offender into society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that once a child has completed his or her sentence, the juvenile detention centres no longer have formal authority to impose further restrictions on the child. However, it is not uncommon for children who have been in these facilities to maintain contact with the centres and to seek advice and support from time to time when they encounter difficulties. The juv<Col N="371" /> enile offender centres seek to offer all possible support on such occasions.</P>
    <P>The importance of effective after care for many of the children who go through the young offender system is recognised in the Children Bill, 1999, which provides for much closer co-operation between the various agencies involved. The Bill also makes specific provision whereby a child leaving a detention centre on completion of sentence may consent to be placed under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer. The need for such arrangements to operate on a voluntary basis arises from the fact that the child will already have paid his or her debt to society through serving the custodial sentence imposed by the court and cannot be further penalised.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any case at present where somebody is being refused a place, but where they would go if they cannot get in is obviously a major problem. It is a matter for the Probation and Welfare Service, and whether it can work with them, etc. That is the key problem. That is why it has been identified as a major problem and the investment is now being made in providing the extra places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work which is done by people who are helping children as they come out, to which <Col N="372" /> Deputy Bruton referred, needs additional investment and support. I certainly would give extra support in that area because it is particularly important work which is vital for those young people.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - White Paper on Defence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the House held a timely and detailed debate about the handling and contents of the White Paper on Defence. During that debate the failings of the Minister and the suspicion and mistrust he engendered among all ranks of the Defence Forces were laid bare for all to see.</P>
      <P>On the conclusion of that debate, I called on the Minister to undertake a number of specific actions which will begin the process of rebuilding his relationship with the Defence Forces and restore the morale of the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the State. These were constructive proposals which were in the best interests of both the Defence Forces and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, yet again the plea for a rational and reasoned approach to the Defence Forces was ignored by the Minister. On Saturday morning <i>The Examiner</i> carried an alarming story on its front page, an article which raised the most serious questions about the Minister's ability to continue in the portfolio. In the extracts from the memo published by <i>The Examiner</i> the Minister is alleged to have described the eleventh hour deal <Col N="373" /> hammered out between himself and the Chief of Staff in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Although trumpeted everywhere as a major concession, in effect this supposed agreement is something of a chimera which evaporates under careful scrutiny; in truth a fig leaf to cover the Chief of Staff's retreat from an increasingly untenable position. The spoils of victory claimed by the military comprise a loosely worded document which does little more than restate what is already in the White Paper with a few routine administrative adjustments thrown in for padding.</P>
    <P>The Minister also accused the Defence Forces of acting with a lack of grace which barely fell short of mutiny during the completion of the White Paper. These are disgraceful and contemptuous remarks about the Defence Forces. The Minister must inform the House whether he made or authorised all or some of the remarks in this leaked memo. He must explain the origin of this memo and how it appeared on the front page of a national newspaper. He should also apologise for the insults in the memo aimed at the most senior Army officer in the State if he was involved in its production. The Minister must clarify the situation with regard to the signed agreement he reached with Lieutenant General Stapleton shortly before the publication of the White Paper. Why was this agreement not included in the White Paper or at least inserted in the appendix? Will the contents of this agreement be included in the final version of the White Paper which we are led to believe will be published over the coming days? The Minister must also confirm whether he believes this agreement is an important element of the White Paper or just padding and a fig leaf to cover the retreat of the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>The conduct of the Minister since taking office has had a drastic effect on morale in the Defence Forces. The White Paper process represents a new low in the relationship between the most senior officers and the Minister. The contents of the leaked memo are so serious that unless they can be refuted by the Minister, I regret that his position as Minister for Defence is untenable. No group of workers would put up with the condescending and arrogant approach revealed in the language and content of the memo. His approach to staff relations belongs to the Victorian age and has no place in a modern administration where new challenges and opportunities have to be faced. The memo leaked to <i>The Examiner</i> is nothing short of a disgrace. The author of the memo should have no role in the future direction of the Defence Forces. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The opportunity is a very welcome one for me to cover a number of matters relating to the White Paper. The final text of the White Paper on <Col N="374" /> Defence will be published within about three weeks. As I have informed the House already, this text, agreed with the military authorities, will reflect the fully up-to-date position based on the final inputs I obtained from the Chief of Staff along with any typographical or presentational editing. All who approach the White Paper text in an objective and fair-minded manner will accept that it sets out a dynamic and positive strategy for defence in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My primary concern as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the State has the Defence Forces that it needs. For the first time, with this White Paper, we have a strategy and development plan covering the Defence Forces for the next decade. I have on a number of occasions outlined how the White Paper will achieve this overall objective. I will put these on the record again: a £250 million investment programme to modernise Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure; continuous recruitment with an immediate announcement of 750 new recruits this year; a reduction in the Defence Forces establishment from 11,500 to 10,500 plus the option of 250 recruits in training which will release the necessary funds to achieve a modernised Army, Air Corps and Naval Service; a special additional injection of £5 million in each of the next five years for urgent Air Corps equipment requirements and as part of a three year £55 million programme overall; two new medium lift helicopters will be obtained in addition to a Squirrel helicopter for Air Corps-Garda air support unit training purposes; the purchase of a second new ship for the Naval Service &ndash; yesterday, agreement in principle was reached with Appledore Shipbuilders Limited for the construction of a second<i> Róisín</i>-class offshore patrol vehicle; development of the Reserve Defence Force with enhanced equipment and training; and continuation of our commitment to overseas peace support operations. The Defence Forces capacity in this regard will be enhanced by the modernisation effort.</P>
      <P>The overall approach is visionary and developmental but it is also firmly grounded in reality having regard to the emerging defence and security environment and the resources available. I appreciate fully that some people will be cautious in their reaction to the White Paper. However, the Defence Forces which have to respond to challenging operational situations as a normal part of their work, which they do so well, appreciate that a process of positive development is critical to ensuring that they are well placed to meet the challenges of the future. The programme of change set out in the White Paper is a very positive one, involving more and better equipment and a challenging programme of developments, all of which will make the Defence Forces an extremely exciting place in which to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In years to come the White Paper on Defence will be seen as a basis for the Defence Forces to become a modern, world class military organisation. We have already started the implementation process with my recent announcement <Col N="375" /> about equipment, investment and recruitment, and this process will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The White Paper will also bring many benefits to Civil Defence. In the next decade, Civil Defence will continue to focus its efforts on enhancing its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality second line service in addition to serving local communities in a variety of ways. The White Paper also outlines key issues facing the civil side of the Department of Defence where the process of strategic change will continue in both the Civil Service and the civilian employee areas.</P>
    <P>I sincerely regret that the Opposition has focused unduly on the process of the production rather than on the content of which is truly a ground-breaking White Paper. I care deeply for the image of the Defence Forces and I will be continuing my efforts on their behalf. In this regard, I am looking forward to my visit next week to our troops who are carrying out such sterling work in peacekeeping in Lebanon. On this visit, as always, I will be conveying the good wishes and respect of this House and of the nation to the men and women who selflessly carry out excellent work in a foreign and often very dangerous environment.</P>
    <P>In respect of the points made by Deputy Wall, I had a meeting with the two deputy chiefs of the Defence Forces last Monday. It was possibly one of the most important, positive and forward-looking meetings we have had for some time. Everyone is consigning to the past what happened in recent weeks. We are now concentrating attention on what is contained in the White Paper and providing the necessary funds which up to now the Defence Forces could only dream of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to present the case for decentralisation to Newcastle West. I urgently appeal to the Government to decentralise an office to Newcastle West, County Limerick. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that he is committed to decentralisation and hopes to decentralise at least 10,000 jobs to rural Ireland. I also agree with the recent statement by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, that she would not support decentralisation to major cities such as Limerick, Galway, Dublin and so on. It makes sense to decentralise offices of State and governmental agencies to rural provincial towns as many of our cities become congested. As part of the national plan, a key part of the spatial plan has to be decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now the decentralisation policy has been very much on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis and seemed to refer to the personal fiefdom of an individual Government Minister. Recent examples are the decisions of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to relocate a Department to Cahirciveen; the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to relocate one to Tullamore; the <Col N="376" /> Minister, Deputy Smith, to move the headquarters of Civil Defence to Roscrea and two sections of the Civil Service administration of the Army to Tipperary; and the Minister, Deputy Fahy, to relocate the Marine Institute to Galway. This decentralisation policy means it is the personal property of a Minister to decide where decentralisation takes place.</P>
    <P>In recent times Newcastle West has seen industrial losses with Neodata Limited, Kostal and a large section of Giro Limited. The IDA and Shannon Development seem to have difficulty in finding replacement industries. It is my understanding that this will be compounded further as County Limerick does not have Objective One status and the emphasis of the Government's policy with regard to industry will focus on the Border, midland and western regions. Despite this, Newcastle West has seen great urban renewal. It has seen the population in the hinterland and the town grow to over 5,000. There has been a tremendous increase in private housing, mainly because of its location within a 25 mile radius of Limerick. Housing is cheaper in Newcastle West. It is also a popular location for people to live who are working outside the area. In recent times, the county council opened a new office costing in excess of £1 million, thus giving further recognition to Newcastle West as the county capital.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the local community council which launched a document last Monday on decentralisation. It is a commendable document and I am thankful for the support the county council and Shannon Development gave the community council in producing it. We hope in the near future to ensure the document is passed on to the appropriate personnel in the Department of Finance for the Minister's attention. In particular, I wish to respond to the public launch of the document which was attended by the four Oireachtas representatives, including Deputies Collins and Neville and Senator John Cregan, who supported the community council and the various interested parties in their attempts to have a project decentralised to Newcastle West. Therefore, across the political spectrum there is an appreciation that Newcastle West should benefit from a decentralisation project.</P>
    <P>The town has had many remarkable achievements in the past, and in terms of its evolution, any Government Department decentralised to Newcastle West would be extremely happy. A building has become available, although it may not be available for too long. I hope the Government will make a decision in the very near future regarding locations for decentralisation and that Newcastle West will be included.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the Minister will announce this evening that Newcastle West will feature as a location. Rather, I anticipate a general response and I am putting down a clear marker that I will pursue the matter with great vigour to ensure Newcastle West is a location for decentralisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm labhairt ar son an tAire Airgeadais ar an ábhar seo. Decentralisation has been the subject of much debate and interest, and I thank Deputy Finucane for giving me the opportunity to speak about it today.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware the Minister for Finance has recently embarked on a process of consultation with his Government colleagues with a view to taking decisions on a significant programme of decentralisation by the summer. This new programme will be considerably more radical than the current programme which, by the time it has concluded, will involve the relocation of over 4,000 civil servants from Dublin to a large number of provincial locations.</P>
      <P>The current process of consultation maintains the momentum of the Government's commitment to transferring the maximum number of public sector jobs from Dublin. This was first announced in the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement and will be achieved through the relocation of almost entire Government Departments, offices and other public bodies to provincial centres. It is intended that the forthcoming programme will for the first time involve non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. The Minister's budget announcement endorses the commitment set out in the reviewed Action Programme for the Millennium to a policy of balanced regional development and sets as a key priority the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas.</P>
      <P>In developing a new programme, the Minister and the Government have in mind a number of objectives including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The impact of the current programme of decentralisation cannot be underestimated given that it involves almost 20 towns throughout the country. In Deputy Finucane's county over 500 staff have already relocated to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick city. The process of decentralisation has had a considerable impact throughout the country with all regions benefiting from the Government's policy. Decentralisation over the past ten years or so has contributed handsomely to a situation where almost 50% of all civil servants are located outside of Dublin and there is a significantly improved geographical spread of Government services.</P>
      <P>All of us are aware of the contribution made to local communities through the creation of jobs and the policy of decentralisation has enhanced many provincial communities through the addition of new jobs with the consequential positive economic boost. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of existing and often under used local infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all of us are conscious of the coverage the decentralisation proposals have received <Col N="378" /> recently, particularly in the media, the Minister is anxious to caution against any expectation that a large-scale relocation of public servants to provincial locations is imminent. Members will appreciate that considerable planning will be required before this most ambitious programme is commenced. It will be necessary to identify appropriate blocks of work, select and train staff and source suitable accommodation. I say this not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Minister for Finance or the Government, but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>The Minister specifically wants to address those public representatives, many of them in this House, who have been in touch with him recently about the subject of decentralisation and to acknowledge the very impressive cases which have been advanced for many potential locations. Furthermore, he is anxious to reassure those who have been making representations that these cases will be considered fully by him and the Government. In that context Deputy Finucane can be assured that the case now being made by him for the inclusion of Newcastle West in any new programme has been noted and will be considered fully in the context of the consultative process on which the Minister has embarked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>How long can our luck last in relation to food safety? The most recent food scare has been serious, but not devastating. Despite a very pro-active and high profile stance by the Food Safety Authority on food hygiene, the country was visited again two weeks ago by yet another outbreak of food poisoning caused by salmonella and resulting in hospital treatment for a number of people. For a country that relies very heavily on the promotion of a clean and green image for its food products, this outbreak sends out the wrong message.</P>
      <P>This is not the only incident, however, that is of concern. Figures published recently by the Department of Health and Children for 1999 and to which I referred in another debate in the House show that the number of reported cases of food borne illness is on the increase. Published figures do not include cases of campylobacter or e.coli 0157, neither of which is notifiable. It is also widely recognised that the total number of reported cases does not reflect the real number and that many incidents go unreported.</P>
      <P>Figures made available for BSE for the months of January and February show an increase in the numbers of cases for each of these months. As with cases of food poisoning, the number of cases of BSE for 1999 was also up on previous years. Taken together, these notifications send signals to the regulatory authorities that all is not well with the controls that are in place for the management of food safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> Food poisoning such as that caused by salmonella last week arises because contaminated food is allowed to travel through the food chain to the consumer without proper controls. It is a fact that raw food contains bacteria that may cause illness, but a number of barriers are available to prevent these bacteria reaching the consumer. When an outbreak occurs, it is clear that the barriers were not in place or are not working properly.</P>
    <P>The education and training of personnel in the food industry is of the utmost importance. The high turnover of casual staff in the food industry often makes this difficult, but the consequences of inadequate hygiene training can be very serious. A number of smaller food companies do not employ technical personnel who are trained and competent to run a processing operation and who are informed about the need for correct sanitation programmes in the processing area. Auditing of hygiene practices within a factory may be non-existent or haphazard. A good auditing protocol would detect deficiencies in the processes.</P>
    <P>The number of environmental health officers employed to monitor food operations is inadequate. All food operations &ndash; production, processing, catering and retail &ndash; should be inspected on a regular basis and should be allowed to continue in production only if they meet the required standards. Equally, a qualified technical person should be employed in all food processing operations. Without the necessary technical awareness and expertise, untrained personnel may not even recognise the existence of a particular hazard in a processing operation and this is a serious gap in many food processing industries.</P>
    <P>We regularly remind ourselves in Ireland that we have the best quality and safest food. Unfortunately, we do not have the evidence to support this argument any more. Greater policing and enforcement measures are required if a major outbreak of a serious nature is to be avoided. We have been remarkably lucky to have escaped an outbreak of e.coli 0157, as occurred in Scotland two years ago. Salmonella belongs to the same family as e.coli 0157. They share many characteristics including their natural habitat, which is an animal source, and they share a similar heat resistance. If, therefore, an outbreak of food poisoning caused by salmonella can occur, there is no reason an outbreak of e.coli 0157 cannot also occur. However, a major difference relates to the greater virulence of e.coli 0157 and, therefore, the much more serious symptoms, as a result of this infection.</P>
    <P>There is no room for congratulations or complacency as far as the safety of Irish food is concerned. There have been a number of narrow escapes. Illnesses that have occurred have been relatively mild by comparison with the worst case scenario that could have resulted form an outbreak from e.coli. Although the food industry may be damaged when an outbreak occurs, the real loser is the unfortunate consumer who becomes ill from the contaminated food. Stepping <Col N="380" /> up the control systems, improved policing and reporting and substantial education and training programmes are essential if a major crisis is to be averted. The food industry, at almost every level, is inadequately policed. Training in many areas is non-existent or seriously inadequate. A co-ordinated, structured and effective action programme should be put in place with adequate resources to underpin it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this issue. An outbreak of food poisoning caused by salmonella occurred within recent weeks in the North-Eastern Health Board region. The health board has co-ordinated an intensive investigation into the outbreak in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Investigations by the NEHB linked the outbreak to cooked ham products produced by a company in Navan, County Meath. A recall of affected product was immediately arranged and is now complete. The health board and the FSAI made available helplines to provide consumers and retailers with advice on control measures to be adopted. I am advised by the authority that it considers the outbreak to be over and to date the company concerned remains closed.</P>
      <P>It has long been recognised that laws and their enforcement are not sufficient in themselves in ensuring the safety of food. Education and enforcement must go hand in hand. An essential element in the provision of safe food is adequate knowledge and education. Food handlers also play a key role in the prevention of food poisoning. It is widely recognised that food handlers, through poor personal hygiene, poor handling or handling food while medically unfit, may allow food to become contaminated. Educating food handlers to adhere to good personal hygiene and good practices is therefore essential.</P>
      <P>It is equally important that employers recognise their role and ensure that food handlers have or are given the knowledge they need to do their work. Under the Hygiene of Foodstuffs Regulations 1998, S.I. 86 of 1998, proprietors are legally responsible to ensure that food handlers are adequately supervised, instructed and-or trained in food hygiene. The FSAI is collaborating with the food industry sector and official food control agencies in a number of initiatives that focus on training workers in the food industry in food hygiene and safe handling. These include the Food Safety Training Council, training database for industry, curriculum development at third level and food safety lectures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Training Council was formed in 1999 and comprises representatives from all sectors of the food industry, training providers and inspectors. Its aim is to co-ordinate and improve food safety training and practice in Ireland and to develop guidelines for the inspection of effective training in the workplace. After <Col N="381" /> full consultation with the food industry and training providers the agreed approach is to develop standards based on competency. This means that the standards will specify what a food handler should know and be competent at for the level of job undertaken. Standards will be developed by sub-groups of the council for all sectors of the food industry. Sub-committees have now been formed by the council to agree expected standards of skills and knowledge required of all employees in the food industry in the area of food safety.</P>
    <P>The FSAI is developing a database which will serve as a complete source of information for industry on training in food safety. The authority has been actively involved in curriculum development at third level for courses which train future managers in the food industry, such as chefs and food scientists, with a view to developing the food safety content of their programmes. The authority has been involved in direct training activities in the form of food safety lectures. In association with the industry, the authority has delivered the food safety message directly to food handlers and business owners. In two series of nationwide seminars during 1999 the authority delivered food hygiene lectures to more than 600 owners and employees of delicatessens and catering businesses.</P>
    <P>These seminars were designed to promote safe food handling practices, particularly in the fast food context, and were accompanied by a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Safe Food To Go&rdquo; to reinforce the message delivered. I draw attention to &ldquo;The Primary Food Hygiene Course&rdquo;, an initiative of the Environmental Health Officers Association aimed at raising standards in food safety, which I launched in July 1999. Its objective is to provide staff involved in food preparation with adequate training in the basic principles of food hygiene.</P>
    <P>I also compliment my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy O'Keeffe, on establishing the expert group on food quality assurance schemes, which held its inaugural meeting on 29 February 2000. This group, which is expected to report to the Minister of State by the end of the year, will review schemes currently in place in Ireland, and will work towards ensuring that such schemes, of which food safety is an intrinsic aspect, are operated in accordance with a recognised international standard.</P>
    <P>Proprietors of food premises have a legal responsibility to ensure that food handlers are adequately supervised, instructed and-or trained in food hygiene. I am satisfied with the initiatives in food safety training undertaken to date by the FSAI. I also pay tribute to the work in this area of the Environmental Health Officers Association and I urge that all food workers are enabled to have access to such courses. The education of food workers at all levels commensurate with their responsibilities is essential if we are to ensure the safety of food in Ireland.</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Lorraine Yeates died at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, on 18 June 1985. Lorraine was almost six years old and collapsed following a heart attack on her way home from school. She was brought to Crumlin hospital by her mother where she was placed on a ventilator but she died approximately ten hours later, having suffered another heart attack. When Lorraine died her doctor approached her parents and told them that he would have to perform a coroner's post mortem because she had only been in the hospital for ten hours and that legally he was bound to perform it. According to the child's mother, she was told that her permission was not required for this.</P>
      <P>The post mortem was carried out on 19 June 1985. Last week the mother contacted the Dublin City Coroner's Office to ask for a full post mortem report on her daughter and has received a letter from the coroner which stated: &ldquo;Lorraine's death was not reported to the coroner's office. We have made extensive inquiries and it would appear that an in-house post mortem was performed by Crumlin hospital who then registered the death.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Baby Michael Reilly was aged five months when he died on 13 December 1994 during surgery under anaesthetic within 24 hours of admission to Our Lady's hospital. Again, the baby's mother was told that a coroner's post mortem was a legal requirement. The post mortem was subsequently performed on 14 December 1994. The child's heart and lungs were removed and retained. The baby's mother also checked with the Dublin City Coroner's Office and was informed that the office was never notified about Michael's death.</P>
      <P>Section 18(4) of the Coroners Act, 1962, states:</P>
      <P>Every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling and every person in charge of an institution or premises in which a deceased person was residing at the time of his death who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, either directly or indirectly as a result of violence or misadventure of by unfair means or as a result of negligence or misconduct or malpractice on the part of others, or from any cause other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation (including death as the result of the administration of an anaesthetic), shall immediately notify the coroner within whose district the body of the deceased is lying of the facts and circumstances of the death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone was the coroner not notified, neither were the Garda. Subsection (5) states that if the coroner is not notified, a member of the Garda <Col N="383" /> Síochána, not below the rank of sergeant, must be notified.</P>
    <P>In the case of Lorraine Yeates, the family has confirmation from Crumlin Garda station that there is no record of the death being registered with them. The Garda also confirmed to the mother that in the case of a coroner's post mortem, a garda should have been present to identify the body of the little girl. The Garda also told the mother that form C71 was not filled out. Likewise, in the case of baby Michael Reilly, the family has established that there is no evidence of form C71 having been completed in either Sundrive or Crumlin Garda stations.</P>
    <P>These families have already been deeply traumatised by the unauthorised withholding of their children's organs. This latest development, which flouts the clear intention of the Coroner's Act, 1962, has now raised the status of the controversy to a new level. Until now, we were talking about the ethics and propriety of taking the organs of dead children without consultation with or permission from parents or guardians. Now we are dealing with a breach of the law. The law was disregarded and therefore broken.</P>
    <P>It is clear that all of the circumstances surrounding the death of the children, the subsequent unauthorised withholding of their organs and the failure to comply with the strict letter of the law means that the demand of the parents for a fully statutory inquiry is fully justified and should be conceded.</P>

On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I would like to extend his apologises for not addressing the House personally on this matter. The Minister has an appointment this afternoon with Parents for Justice and is therefore unable to be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely sorry that these parents are now faced with further uncertainty regarding the post mortem examinations carried out on their children. Section 18(4) of the Coroner's Act, 1962, <i>inter alia</i>, provides that every medical practitioner who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, whether directly or indirectly, from any reason other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and <Col N="384" /> treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation, including death as a result of the administration of an anaesthetic, shall immediately notify the coroner within whose district the body is of the fact and circumstances relating to the death.</P>
    <P>My Department has made inquiries in this matter both of the hospital and of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish the procedures that were followed in these cases. The hospital has clarified that its normal practice at the time would have been to notify the coroner, as distinct from the Garda, and that this notification would commonly have been given by telephone from the hospital.</P>
    <P>The hospital is currently engaged in a thorough search of its records in relation to both of these cases. When this search is completed, the Minister has asked that a full report of its findings be furnished to him by the hospital. The initial indication from the coroner's office is that it has no records pertaining to these cases.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on 9 February 2000 the Minister announced his intention to hold an inquiry into the issue relating to post mortem examinations, organ removal, organ retention and organ disposal at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. The terms of reference, scope and form of inquiry are still under discussion with a number of parties, including the Attorney General and Parents for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated that the inquiry will provide for a review of post mortem policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970 and, in particular, as it related to organ removal, retention and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside the State, as well as an examination and the application of these policies, practices and procedures in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>

      <Quest>if he will urgently develop a database on children with special needs in the education system in order that a coherent approach to planning for the meeting of their needs will be put in place.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7250/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): At present, my Department collects statistics on the number of pupils with special needs attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. However, information on special needs pupils attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis is not specifically collected.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently planning to extend the range of data gathered on special needs pupils, as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual pupils. The objective is to develop a database which will provide critical information on all pupils, including those with special needs, to support the development and implementation of policy.</P>
    <P>A total of £4.5 million is being provided to develop this database over the next three years. This includes £500,000 which is being provided in the current year. The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the database project and it is intended to implement the first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year. It is anticipated that the project will use the latest internet based technologies to facilitate the convenient transfer of data to my Department from schools.</P>
    <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children assessed as having special educational needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to special support services. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 642 child care assistants to support children with special needs in the primary system.</P>
    <P>All primary schools have been advised of this development and of the procedures to be followed in seeking support for special needs pupils. My Department is responding to requests for such support on an ongoing basis and will continue to make relevant resources available to support such pupils. This process is already providing significant and valuable data on the prevalence of special needs within the primary system. The database which is now being planned will facilitate the development of a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the level of special needs within the system.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. However, the available data do not facilitate valid comparisons to be made between the levels of grants payable by my Department and the actual costs of running schools.</P>
      <P>The standard capitation grant at primary level was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999 which brought the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33% increase over the period. Schools with enrolments of 60 pupils or less receive a minimum grant of £3,600. In addition, the grant is being increased by a further £11 this coming school year. In relation to voluntary secondary schools, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this coming school year. Budgetary allocations to the other second-level sectors are increased on a pro rata basis.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these increases represent a meaningful response to the need for increased funding from schools generally. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary and second level schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The breaking the cycle project was introduced in selected urban and rural primary schools in September 1996. This five-year project has two dimensions, urban and rural. There are 33 schools in the urban dimension of the project and the principal feature of that dimension is the significant reduction of class size in the junior, infant to second, classes to a maximum of 15 pupils per teacher. A co-ordinator was appointed to promote the development of the project in the urban schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 122 schools in the rural dimension of the <Col N="387" /> project get enhanced capitation grants. Co-ordinators were appointed to local clusters of project schools to establish home-school liaison and to support pupils and teachers in the schools.</P>
    <P>The other benefits for schools in both dimensions of the project include grants for the purchase of books and learning materials and for local support and developmental initiatives. On application for inclusion schools gave undertakings that they would participate in school planning, in in-career development and in evaluation.</P>
    <P>Evaluation of the Breaking the Cycle project is being conducted by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. I have not yet received the interim evaluation report. A preliminary evaluation report provided base-line data against which future evaluation data will be compared. Interim reports on both the urban and rural dimensions of Breaking the Cycle will be submitted to my Department in April. I intend to publish these interim reports shortly thereafter. I am expecting the final reports to be submitted to me in December 2001.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate the point in a child's development at which the project will have a positive impact in countering educational disadvantage and no specific target has been set.</P>
    <P>I am finalising plans for the expenditure of £194 million over the next three years on educational disadvantage. A survey of all primary schools will take place during the current school term to assess the level of concentration in them of pupils with specific background characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage. Levels of targeted supports will be given to schools next September in accordance with their levels of need.</P>

      <P>Estimated participation rates in primary schools in the school year 1997-98 for the ages in question were as follows: age three and under, 1%; age four, 52%; age five, 100%; and age six, 100%. In addition, 1,076 children aged three and under and 483 children aged four were enrolled in the pilot early start pre-school programme, bringing the estimated participation rates in the formal school system to 3% at age three and 53% at age four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school attendance Acts currently apply to children aged six years and upwards, and the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, currently being debated in the Oireachtas, does not propose any <Col N="388" /> change to this. However, with the exception of the children in early start, some of whom attend from the age of three, most children attend primary school from the September following their fourth birthday. I envisage that this situation will remain largely unchanged in the future and that, accordingly, the participation rates outlined above will also be generally unchanged in future years.</P>
    <P>These figures relate only to children in the State-funded primary school system. There are substantial numbers of children who attend at pre-school facilities either in the private sector or funded by other State Departments or agencies.</P>
    <P>The focus of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, is on maintaining and enhancing the quality of pre-school education provision, regardless of the setting &ndash; school, home or other setting. The White Paper focuses in particular on increasing participation among the priority groups children who are educationally disadvantaged and children with disabilities and addresses the issue of direct provision where there are gaps in provision.</P>

My Department is currently working with the Educational Research Centre on finalising a range of indicators which will form the basis of a questionnaire to be sent to all primary schools. The purpose of this questionnaire will be to identify levels of educational disadvantage among pupils and schools across the primary system.</P>
      <P>I will bring forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage within the primary system.

      <P>Based on the levels of need identified through the indicators, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system.

      <P>It is my intention that all children with learning difficulties shall have access to the necessary support services to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
      <P>Depending on the level of learning difficulty involved, the needs of such children may be capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support of the remedial or resource teacher services. Since September last, the remedial teacher service has been extended to all first and second level schools in the country. A total of 1,465 remedial teachers are now in place in the primary system and a further 560 are in place in the second level system. This service should now be available to all children who require such support.</P>
      <P>In addition, all children with special needs, including specific learning difficulties, within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs. The response, may take the form of special resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the assessed needs of the individual child. Already, as a result of the introduction of this automatic entitlement, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has grown from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 299 to 937. A further 239 resource teachers are in place in the second level system. The process of allocating additional resource teacher and child care support is continuing and it is my intention that my Department should respond to requests for such support in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</P>
      <P>Where a child's learning difficulties are of a more acute nature, the child may require placement in one of the range of special schools or special classes which are provided to deliver dedicated support services to groups of children with particular learning needs. All such facilities now operate at the significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee. They also receive special increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am formulating proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of children who are encountering educational difficulties as a result of their socio-economic circumstances. I am convinced of the need for the introduction of significant and targeted interventions in this area in order to ensure that disadvantaged children get the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. As Minister for <Col N="391" /> Education and Science it is my objective to ensure that adequate resources are provided to help schools to combat educational disadvantage and ensure that children emerge from our primary education system with basic skills in literacy and numeracy. The package of measures which I will bring forward will be targeted specifically towards achieving this objective.</P>

      <P>The 31 approved subjects in the leaving certificate curriculum are assessed in a variety of ways. In the case of 20 subjects assessment is by means of a terminal written examination, involving two examination papers in the case of English and mathematics, and one examination paper in the case of the other subjects. In the case of the five languages Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian there is a combination of a terminal written examination, oral and aural examinations.</P>
      <P>In the case of agricultural science and agricultural economics there is a written examination paper and a project while, in the case of engineering and construction studies there are three components, written, practical and project. Art has a written paper and three separate practical components while music has a written paper, an aural test and a practical performance test and, in some cases, depending on the elective chosen an additional written paper or portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the leaving certificate applied there is assessment at four key stages during the two year programme with a significant degree of the total of 100 credits &ndash; 67 credits &ndash; being attainable for course work.

      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. Furthermore, as recommended in the report, my Department continues to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new second level schools.</P>

      <P>Suicide is both a tragic and serious matter which, unfortunately, has increased in recent years, among young men in particular. The prevention of suicide is an issue for a range of agencies and the role of schools in prevention is recognised.</P>
      <P>The report of the national task force on suicide, published in January 1998, made a number of recommendations on prevention in the education area. These were that teachers be supported in respect of the psychological and social dimensions of their work through continued professional educational courses, that programmes be initiated aimed at teaching children positive health issues, that guidance counsellors be available to all schools, and that the psychological services for schools be extended.</P>
      <P>The subject, social, personal and health education is being introduced as part of the revised curriculum for primary schools. This subject is also to be introduced as a core part of the junior cycle curriculum at second level. Colleges of Education and University Departments of Education are taking account of this change. Ongoing in-career development for teachers will be an integral part of the introduction of SPHE and is already available on a regular basis as part of the support for substance misuse prevention education and relationships and sexuality education programmes at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The provision of counselling in schools has been improved, at post-primary level, by the sanction of a minimum of eight hours counselling per week for schools with 200 students or less, one full-time post for schools with 500 students or more and up to two full-time counselling posts for schools with 1,000 students or more.</P>
      <P>A national educational psychological agency was established by my Department in September 1999. The agency will employ 200 educational psychologists between now and the year 2003. The process of recruiting up to 50 additional educational psychologists for the agency is under way and these additional psychologists will become available during the current year.</P>

    <P>The final phase of the proposed agreement is conditional on verification of progress on the ongoing modernisation of the public service.

      <P>The Drumcondra English profiles are designed to be used by teachers in profiling the progress of all pupils in their classes. Their primary purpose is to provide overall indices of a pupil's achievement in oral language, reading and writing at or near the end of the school year. It is hoped that this information will be used for record keeping, and for communicating with other teachers and with parents. A secondary purpose is to provide teachers with information that can guide planning and teaching throughout the school year.</P>
      <P>The profiles are compiled from the informal assessments made by the teacher of each pupil's mastery of key objectives of the English curriculum and from the results of formal tests, including standardised tests.</P>
      <P>The profiles were not designed to monitor or diagnose special educational needs such as dyslexia. However, specific suggestions are given in regard to assessment activities in oral language, reading and writing which support the implementation of the English profiles. Important early skills in the area of reading, for example, are identified for teachers and suggestions are made in regard to appropriate assessment activities to detect a pupil's progress in areas such as emergent literacy, phonemic awareness and word identification. Serious delays or lack of progress in these areas in the case of particular pupils are generally good indicators of literacy difficulties, including dyslexia.</P>

      <P>In 1993 and again in 1998 the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, in conjunction with the Inspectorate of my Department conducted a national English reading survey of pupils in fifth class. Three domains of literacy were tested &ndash; narrative, expository and documents. Scores were identical, or almost so, for each domain and for the total in the two surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> The percentages of pupils scoring two or more standard deviations below the mean is often taken as an indicator of a very serious level of difficulty. Approximately 2% of pupils scored at this level in both surveys.</P>
    <P>Teachers were asked to estimate the percentage of their pupils in fifth class who performed at a level appropriate to third class or lower or who were, in their opinion, weak-inadequate readers. Teachers rated approximately 10% of their pupils in this category. This can be taken as a reliable estimate of the number of pupils who complete the primary cycle with substantial literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some pupils within this category can be assumed to have a specific reading difficulty, or dyslexia. It is estimated about 2% of pupils have such a difficulty.</P>

      <P>Clearly, nutrition is vitally important to the health of children, and is of particular significance in areas designated as disadvantaged. Undernourished children or children in poor health are unlikely to be in a position to take full advantage of the education system. While my Department responds to educational disadvantage through various schemes, the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs have responsibility in areas relating to malnutrition.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs engaged consultants to carry out a review of the school meals scheme and has forwarded a copy of the consultants' report to my Department. A working group comprising officials from both Departments together with representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Finance and Dublin Corporation has been established to review the existing scheme.</P>
      <P>In carrying out the evaluation of the school meals scheme the working group will also consult with many other relevant bodies. It is anticipated that it will take seven to eight months to complete this process.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that tackling educational disadvantage will be a priority. Resources, both teaching and financial, will be available for this purpose. In developing the details of my proposals to tackle educational disadvantage I will bear in mind the issues raised by the Deputy and the recommendations of relevant expert groups.</P>

      <P>The issue of raising the skills profile of people and of addressing the skills needs of the economy has been identified as a key priority in the Action Programme for the Millennium and in the national employment action plan. Over the past few years, a range of initiatives have been introduced to enhance co-operation between education and business and to ensure that our education system adequately responds to emerging labour market needs.  These initiatives will be built upon in the planned educational investment outlined in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring an adequate supply of high quality output from the PLCs, Institutes of Technology and universities at sub-degree, degree and post-graduate levels in order to maintain and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly mobile international investment in an increasingly knowledge based global economy. The Government established the expert group on future skills needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skills needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. In response to the first report of the expert group on future skills needs, this Government provided a £75 million investment plan to provide an additional 5,400 places predominantly in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas.</P>
      <P>Another initiative in this area is the provision of some 1,500 post-graduate places on a skills conversion programme for 1999-2000 to meet skills needs in the ICT area as identified by the expert skills group.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the joint education-industry task force to improve the supply of technicians to the high-technology sector, an industry-college initiative was introduced in 1998 to jointly recruit, educate and train technicians. The national certificate in manufacturing technology was initiated in January, 1998 in nine institutes of technology. The course involves structured work placement for six months as an integral part of the course and based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement. There are some 1,100 students currently on accelerated technician programmes in the institute of technology sector attending courses in the following skills shortage areas &ndash; manufacturing technology, computing IT support and industrial science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> Also at third level, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation has developed formal links in the form of joint councils with both the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities and the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology.</P>
    <P>Within the PLC sector, an applied languages and information technology, international teleservices programme has been introduced in collaboration with industry.</P>
    <P>Investment in adult literacy services has increased ninefold since the Government took office in 1997, and the national development plan provides for £73.8 million in this critical area over the period 2000-06. A major back to education initiative has also been provided for, costing £1.027 billion, to encourage young people and adults, especially those who left the system with less than upper secondary education, to return to learning. An Adult ICT skills programme will be implemented as part of this initiative. The initiative will provide for a significant expansion of part-time options in further education which will be important in enabling those in employment, as well as adults in the population generally, to upgrade their skills on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>At second level, the introduction of the transition year programme, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme has increased the workplace-education link through work experience and simulation. The revised syllabus for leaving certificate business places a great deal of emphasis on the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills.</P>
    <P>In collaboration with teachers, IBEC has designed a pack called Altramas meaning fosterage in Irish, which aims to develop in students those personal, interpersonal and enterprise skills which will serve them well as they move from the school environment into the world of work. The business and education links programme, established by IBEC, aims to help pupils to appreciate the world of business and contributes to the development of pupils' work skills by means of classroom talks, company visits and linked activities.</P>
    <P>Concerns about the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate link into the future supply of skills, particularly in the light of Ireland's evolution into a high technology economy. This issue is being addressed at second level through the modernisation of school laboratories, the revision of different science syllabi and the provision of extensive training for teachers.</P>
    <P>In the light of these initiatives and the planned investment provided for in the national development plan, I am confident that our education system is capable of meeting the changing industrial needs of the economy.</P>

      <P>Apprentice numbers have expanded significantly in recent years as a result of the growth in the construction industry and the economy generally. Apprentice registrations were 4,734 in the academic year 1996-97, rose to 6,070 in 1997-98 and increased to 6,832 in 1998-99. The need for additional capacity in institutes of technology to cater for these increases is being addressed in conjunction with the institutes.</P>
      <P>A major capital investment programme to provide extra capacity is in train and extra facilities will be provided in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford Institutes of Technology as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, my Department has provided the institutes with additional resources to enable them to expand existing programmes where possible. Extra staff has been sanctioned and additional funding is being provided to meet the cost of extra courses. In the two financial years 1998 and 1999 a total of £6 million of additional recurrent funding was provided to fund additional courses. A further £5 million extra is being provided this year. As a result of the measures taken to-date, the number of apprentices catered for in the educational system has increased from approximately 4,000 in 1997-1998 to 6,700 in 1998-99 and to 7,200 in the current academic year.</P>

      <P>Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>The Montessori teachers with restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dun Laoghaire, who have successfully completed the diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Montessori teachers are not currently recognised as fully qualified primary teachers or as remedial teachers, who also may be required to teach the full primary curriculum to the pupils to whom they are assigned.</P>

A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers and for remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, which was published last December, sets out a range of proposals concerning educational provision for children aged from birth to six years. Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in Ready to Learn, including those which relate to Montessori teachers, is currently under way in my Department. Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties. As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced a process of consultation on the White Paper. I expect that this process will commence shortly.</P>

      <P>A working group under the aegis of my Department, and comprising representatives from the partners in education at primary level, has been engaged in the process of reviewing the complaints procedure that applies at primary level.</P>
      <P>The procedure that applies with regard to processing complaints is an agreement that was entered into by the primary management bodies and the INTO. This procedure has been in operation for a number of years and it was considered opportune by my Department and the partners in education that it should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The review process is progressing well and a number of drafts of a new procedure have been sent to the partners for their comments in the past few months. There are still a number of points which have to be agreed by all the partners and it is hoped to progress these matters over the coming weeks. It is my intention, and that of the partners, that the new procedure would be available to all schools by the beginning of the next school year in September 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was introduced in 33 urban and 123 rural schools in 1996 to test models of intervention which would offset the effects of educational disadvantage over a five year period. The Educational Research Centre has been commissioned to evaluate the breaking the cycle project. In 1996 the centre initiated a programme of testing to establish baseline data against which the impact of the project could be measured. This programme included identification of attainment levels in literacy and numeracy in third and sixth classes in the urban schools in the project and in a sample of 50 of the rural schools. It is proposed to assess pupils' literacy and numeracy attainment again in May 2000. The impact of the initiative on pupil attainment will be measured in this context and reported on in the final evaluation report, which will be available to my Department in December 2001. Any extension of the Breaking the Cycle project to further schools will be considered in light of this report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. My Department is working with the Educational Research Centre on finalising a range of indicators which will form the basis of a questionnaire to be sent to all primary schools, including schools included in the Breaking the Cycle initiative. The purpose of this questionnaire will be to identify levels of educational disadvantage among pupils and schools across the primary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are <Col N="404" /> encountering educational disadvantage within the primary system. The work which my Department is finalising on the proposed questionnaire will allow for an accurate identification of the pupils in question. I expect this work will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Based on the levels of need identified through the questionnaire, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified. I expect to make a further announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Points System, in its final report, sees initiatives to increase participation in third level education by students with educational disadvantage as being the culmination of a range of strategies throughout the students' schooling. The report of the commission has made a number of recommendations in relation to disadvantaged students. The principal recommendation is that the quota for disadvantaged students in third level education should be increased to 5% and the longer term aspiration would be to increase participation to rates more reflective of their size in the population as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission considers that, building on existing initiatives, there is a need to develop a national approach to ensuring special access schemes encompass disadvantaged students attending non-designated schools. While the commission recognises that there may be difficulties in this approach, it considers that there is a need to develop a definition of a disadvantaged student based on the individual student. In this regard, the commission suggests that the educational disadvantage committee to be established under section 32 of the 1998 Education Act, in consul<Col N="405" /> tation with the Higher Education Authority and the Combat Poverty Agency, might advise me on the precise criteria for defining a disadvantaged student. The report of the commission is being considered by my officials and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>
    <P>In relation to initiatives focusing on the transition from second to third level and on the third level sector, many colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding provided for the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance for students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has commissioned Dr. Bob Osborne of the University of Ulster to undertake an evaluation of the socio-economic access initiatives funded by the Authority. It has also commissioned Professor Malcolm Skilbeck to advise on international issues and strategies in relation to access and equity in higher education. I understand these studies will be completed in late spring 2000 and they will inform the future development of policy in this area.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is in receipt of a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999 the remedial teaching service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being below the 10th percentile in standardised tests in basic numeracy and literacy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where a remedial teacher is providing a service for a <Col N="406" /> group of schools, the special education committee recommended that the caseload be reduced by two for each school in the cluster additional to the base school, subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.</P>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers shares its remedial service with four other schools in the area. This is a common arrangement where schools with small enrolments are involved. The combined enrolment of the five schools is 313 pupils. At such a level of enrolment, the remedial service available to the school is considered to be reasonable and in line with the general operation of the service. The needs of the school in question will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>In the current school year, of the total of 752 schools at second level, 211 have disadvantaged status. Six of these schools are in the Dublin 5 area. Fourteen primary schools in the Dublin 5 area have been designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16% of the school going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17% of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted at the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The position of this school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general staffing of this school, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that, for the current school year, my Department sanctioned the retention of a number of teachers who would otherwise have been liable for redeployment and also granted a concessionary allocation of teaching resources to cater for curricular needs in the school.</P>

      <P>Early Start was introduced in 1994 in eight urban schools designated by my Department as serving areas of disadvantage. In 1995 it was extended to a further 32 similar locations. The project was designed to offset the educational effects of socio-economic deprivation.</P>
      <P>The educational research centre, Drumcondra, was requested to undertake the evaluation of Early Start. The evaluation related to the first two cohorts of pupils in 1994-95 and 1995-96 in the initial eight schools over the first three years of the life of the project. A longitudinal report on the first cohort of Early Start children when they were in second class has been completed. A similar report on the second cohort is due next August.</P>
      <P>No specific targets were set for the project in terms of pupil outcomes. The initial and further evaluations found that there were many positive aspects to the development of the project but no significant cognitive gains were identified in the experimental groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of early preventive education interventions such as Early Start both here and abroad have been found to be long-term. This has been found to be the case, for example, in the Rutland Street project, 1969 to 1974. A longitudinal study identified significant gains in retention in the school system, including third level participation, even though initial gains had been lost by <Col N="408" /> the time participating children were eight years old.</P>
    <P>In the third year of the Early Start project, the approach to the in-career development of the teachers and child-care workers was reviewed. The new approach is being used in successive years since then with teachers and child care workers. The evaluation of the effects of this development is taking place. It will not be possible to come to final conclusions on the effectiveness of Early Start until the pupils who participated in it have completed their second level education.</P>

      <P>A recent population study which was supported by my Department showed that almost 85% of 11 and 12 year old children participate in physical activity four or more times a week. The same study found that the child's physical education experience was positively associated with his or her physical self-perception. These figures in relation to activity levels of children are encouraging.</P>
      <P>The revised primary school curriculum issued to schools in 1999 recommends that a minimum of one hour per week be devoted to physical education. The syllabus for physical education in rules and programmes for secondary schools recommends two hours per week for the physical education programme at both junior and senior cycle. Programmes in physical activity in our schools are provided for in two ways: programmes in physical education based on the syllabus, and co-curricular programmes which include sport and a wide range of other activities.</P>
      <P>The skills, understandings and attitudes developed within the formal programmes in physical education provide a foundation for co-curricular sport and related programmes.</P>

      <P>Specific supports for primary schools serving designated areas of disadvantage began <Col N="410" /> with the provision of concessionary ex-quota staffing in the early 1980s and with the introduction in 1984 of the designation of schools serving large urban areas with high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. Designated schools attracted enhanced capitation funding for the overall management of the school, for the purchase of books and learning materials and for the development of home-school links.</P>
      <P>My Department has not concluded that the disadvantaged areas scheme is not meeting its objectives. Questionnaires completed by school chairpersons, principals, class teachers and parents on the enhanced capitation were very positive towards, and appreciative of, the recognition and support afforded by the increased funding.</P>
      <P>A report based on the questionnaires recommended the establishment of the home-school-community liaison scheme in 1990 and the period from the late 1980s to date was one of transition from equalising opportunity for pupils at risk of educational disadvantage to one of positive discrimination in favour of pupils at risk.</P>
      <P>Positive discrimination is exemplified in the introduction of schemes, projects and initiatives since 1990. These are: the home-school-community liaison scheme that promotes parental involvement in their children's learning by developing collaboration between parents and teachers; Early Start, a pre-school intervention designed to offset the educational effects of educational disadvantage; Breaking the Cycle designed to test an urban and rural response to educational disadvantage; the support teacher project, provided for schools experiencing difficulties in supporting pupils with disruptive, disturbed and withdrawn behaviour; the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative designed to develop models of good practice in the delivery of integrated services to children at risk of educational disadvantage and their families.</P>
      <P>The system of designation at primary level entailed the targeting of resources at the concentrated urban areas with high level of disadvantage and a limited number of small rural schools. Capitation and concessionary staffing were based on the entire school regardless of the numbers of pupils from disadvantaged background on rolls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supports offered were the subject of ongoing internal review. There was also informal feedback from schools and applications for various supports from school and non-school personnel in non-designated school areas. On the basis of continual monitoring and review, it was concluded that the designated school system of supports was too inflexible in that it applied only to a select cohort of schools and to all the pupils in them. Consequently, the provision took no cognisance of the needs of schools in other areas with differing concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds or the needs of the pupils in them. The supports were allocated on an ongoing basis regardless of any changes in the make-up of the designated schools' enrolment and a range of schools in towns and urban areas which have <Col N="411" /> varying levels of concentration of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds received no additional supports.</P>
    <P>I am implementing a three year programme that will target £194 million at addressing educational disadvantage in the various sectors from early education to lifelong and continuing education. As part of this programme a survey of all primary schools will be conducted during the current school term to establish the levels of concentration in the schools of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Tiered supports that respond to the levels of need of the schools will be targeted at those pupils in them who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. The new supports will be made available from next September and will be subject to ongoing review of the level of need in each school and may be increased or reduced to reflect changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Government revised the scheme of exemption from the payment of examination fees and based it on the general medical services card scheme. Through quadrupling the funding available for fee alleviation we have ensured that 30% of the entire student body does not have to pay any examination fees.</P>
      <P>By relating the exemption to an existing means tested scheme my Department has ensured those on lowest incomes benefit from the significant increase in resources made available for relief. This is an effective targeted approach to providing relief from fee payment. This is the most reasonable approach to adopt to ensure maximum coverage.</P>

      <P>Under current arrangements, principals generally remain in their posts until retirement age.

    <P>The appointment of a principal to a primary school is by open competition except in the case of convent and monastery schools.

The person appointed must be qualified for the post. In such cases the duration of the appointment is determined by the religious order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Participation in VTOS has increased from 4,753 in October 1998 to 5,169 at present. A cause of concern, however, is that, while the programme was designed for unemployed people who have had minimal or no qualifications, an increasing proportion of participants seeking to join the programme have completed second-level education.</P>
      <P>In order to address this, a study has been commissioned by the Department to identify and report on the outreach, recruitment, delivery and support strategies which are most effective in catering for those most in need. A draft report has been completed and is being examined with a view to finalisation. The report highlights a range of factors that have contributed in part to a decrease in participation in VTOS among those for whom it was designed. Among the factors highlighted are that since VTOS was first introduced, there has been a major expansion of State investment in work experience and work incentive schemes such as the community employment scheme and the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Measures have been introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of long-term unemployed people in the scheme. The rates of allowances payable under the back to education allowance scheme and VTOS were equalised in 1998 and the 10% quota limiting participation of dependent spouses, lone parents and those with disabilities was abolished. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced last September for participants registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme. A scheme of grants for child care has been provided in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also intend that, as part of the back to education initiative provided for in the national <Col N="413" /> development plan, there will be an increasing focus on the provision of part-time options under VTOS at foundation level or level 1 or equivalent, aimed at those with minimal or no qualifications. Expenditure on the back to education Initiative will amount to £1.027 billion over the period 2000-06, and is expected to total some £425 million over the period 2000-02.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to human resources, as the Deputy is aware, education and training sub committees were established in each of the 38 area based partnerships and each have been assigned a representative of my Department's <Col N="414" /> inspectorate/educational psychological service to support the planning and development of measures to tackle educational disadvantage in their areas. In this instance the local partnership is the canal communities and the task group was notified some time ago of the name of my representative.

      <P>My Department has fully supported the national anti-poverty strategy since its launch in April 1997 and my officials have participated in the work of the inter-departmental NAPS Committee. This committee, which is co-chaired by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social, Community and Family Affairs, is responsible for ensuring the co-ordination and implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>All the educational disadvantage targets from pre-school up to second chance education and third level access in the national anti-poverty strategy have played a significant role in informing policy development in my Department at all levels of the education system. This has resulted in the past two years in significant investment and improvements in many key areas within the education system. These areas were identified in the £57 million plan to tackle educational disadvantage announced in the 1999 budget and in the £194 million plan announced in December last.</P>
      <P>This represents a move away from the piecemeal approach of previous times and represents the largest concentrated effort to tackle educational disadvantage in our history. It is a wide-ranging initiative which touches on every level from early education, first level, second level with particular emphasis on measures to improve retention, second chance education including the back-to-education initiative, adult literacy and third level access programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poverty proofing guidelines developed <Col N="415" /> under the national anti-poverty strategy have been disseminated widely within my Department and these guidelines now form an integral part of programme planning and review to proof all policies for their impact on poverty.</P>
    <P>To give a central co-ordinated focus to this work a social inclusion unit was established in my Department in early 1999 to co-ordinate policy and initiatives aimed at combating social exclusion and educational disadvantage. In addition, a strategic policy directorate was established to oversee and manage in a strategic way the overall policies and strategies of my Department.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department will be participating fully in the national anti-poverty strategy review and revision which has been agreed under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The Review Committee on Post Secondary Education and Training Places, in its recent report, identified the need to increase provision for mature students and recommended that an additional stock of up to 10,000 places for mature students be built up over a period of years. The committee envisaged that these places would primarily be met by increased part-time provision and other flexible options such as distance learning. It recommended that detailed market research be undertaken to validate the demand for mature student places. The higher education authority has been asked to arrange for the recommended market research to be undertaken on mature student demand and to bring forward proposals in relation to meeting such demand.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which has been negotiated between the Government and the social partners, provides for the establishment of a group, with appropriate social partner involvement, to examine and report on barriers to participation by mature students in higher education. The group, when established, will advise my Department on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by mature and disadvantaged students to third level education, building on the experience of current initiatives.</P>

      <P>In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the post-graduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in order to overcome the current shortage of primary school teachers, a scheme has been implemented to pay persons at the trained rate of pay who are working in a temporary <Col N="417" /> capacity in primary schools; possess a primary degree and a higher diploma in education and have obtained a grade C or higher in the higher level leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>The arrangements outlined above have been put in place for this school year as a short-term measure to overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of fully qualified primary school teachers. It is expected that by paying such persons at the trained rate of pay, it will be attractive for them to teach in primary schools. While it is accepted that they are not qualified primary school teachers, in my view it is the best option in resolving the current difficulties in the short-term.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measure outlined, last year arrangements were put in place for primary degree holders with a higher diploma in education to be paid at the trained rate of pay in respect of any substitute work which such persons undertook. It is not a requirement for persons with such qualifications who are engaging in substitute work to possess a grade C in Irish as substitute work is normally of a much shorter duration than temporary work.</P>
    <P>There has been no decision to grant full recognition to holders of a BA and a higher diploma in education for primary teaching purposes.</P>

      <P>Teacher estimates derived from the national reading surveys indicate that nearly 10% of pupils in fifth class at primary level have serious literacy difficulties. Tackling this serious problem for our young children is one of the top priorities for me, as Minister.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of primary schools already engage in annual assessments of their pupils' reading using standardised tests. There is a deep understanding among teachers already of the importance of regular assessment of their pupils' achievements. To date, schools have mainly used test results for reporting to parents and for the identification of pupils with reading difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am exploring ways of making a wider range of assessment instruments available to primary schools to assist them in their work. As a first step I am providing all schools with copies of the Drumcondra English Profiles before the end of the present school year. These instruments will be used in addition to standardised norm-referenced tests to enable teachers to build up a profile of each pupil's strengths and weaknesses. The use of the profiles will enable teachers to plan reading, <Col N="418" /> writing and language programmes to suit the individual needs of each pupil. Training in the use of the profiles will be provided as part of the support programme for the implementation of the revised primary curriculum.</P>
    <P>I also intend to conduct a programme of national surveys of English reading at primary level on a regular basis, in conjunction with the educational research centre, Drumcondra. I will continue the series of surveys at 5th class level and extend the programme to include pupils at second-third class level.</P>
    <P>The use of particular standardised tests by schools and the system of profiling pupil achievements in English combined, will be the basis for the benchmarking and comparative analysis of performance nationally and locally to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that new measures were introduced recently to ensure that there is appropriate educational provision in place for non-English speaking pupils at primary school level.</P>
      <P>Primary schools which have 15 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits will be automatically entitled to an additional temporary teacher for a period of up to two years. Schools with 35 or more such pupils will be entitled to two temporary teachers. Where two schools operate on one campus and have 15 or more such pupils they will be entitled to an additional temporary teacher on a shared basis. Schools eligible for an additional teacher or teachers will also receive a once off grant of £200.</P>
      <P>Primary schools in which between four and 14 non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled will receive grant assistance. Schools with between four and nine such pupils will receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 will receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. Schools with three or fewer such pupils are expected to provide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources. Managerial authorities of schools with non-national primary pupils enrolled who have significant English language deficits should submit an application for assistance to the primary branch of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak <Col N="419" /> English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the arrangements in relation to the allocation of teachers to cater for the education of refugees and asylum seekers will be subject to review. In addition, the refugee language support unit, established under the auspices of Trinity College, will be provided with a budget of the order of £1.2 million over the period of the programme to co-ordinate action for language tuition for refugees to assist them along the pathway to independent living. The unit's functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the refugee agency, FÁS and refugee groups themselves. In addition, refugees are among the groups catered for as part of the adult literacy programme provided by the vocational education committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the findings of the study entitled Benchmarking School Science, Technology and Mathematics Education in Ireland Against International Good Practice (1999).</P>
      <P>The aim of this study was to inform the debate in the areas of science, technology and mathematics education and to provide a factual quantitative and qualitative description of science, technology and mathematics in the Irish school system in comparison with that of four other countries with open knowledge-based societies in the periphery of major trading areas. The other participating countries were Scotland, Finland, Malaysia and New Zealand. By identifying important issues that require attention, it was also hoped that the report would stimulate discussion and assist in the formulation of new policies and help to inform the education debate in these areas. The report was prepared with the assistance of officers of my Department and of educational representatives of the other countries involved in the study.</P>
      <P>The three key issues identified by the study are: how to develop and implement STM education policy that meets the short-term and long-term needs of a rapidly changing society, how to recruit, train and retain high quality STM teachers, especially in the physical sciences and mathematics and how best to teach and assess STM. Primary and post-primary education were analysed separately for the purposes of the study in each country surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to science at primary level all the countries involved are engaged in curriculum review and development as an ongoing process. <Col N="420" /> While the limited science content of the 1971 Curaclam na Bunscoile was noted, the movement to include a wider exposure to science as a specific subject area in the revised primary school curriculum, which is currently being introduced in all primary schools, was deemed significant and welcomed in the study. The trend towards the inclusion of physics and chemistry topics as well as biology in the revised Irish primary school curriculum was commended. It was found that there was a need for an increased emphasis on active learning and problem solving methodologies in both Ireland and Finland.</P>
    <P>The revised Irish primary curriculum has an increased emphasis on science and contains many additions in the areas of active learning and problem solving. The resource implications in terms of teacher training, support, equipment and consumables will be addressed as part of the phased introduction of the revised primary school curriculum.</P>
    <P>In relation to science at second level, the report highlights the importance of developing pupils' understanding of the interactions between science, technology and society. It notes that the revised leaving certificate syllabi in chemistry and physics, to be introduced in September 2000, will devote 30% of their content to the interactions between science, technology and society. At second level in Ireland the move towards active learning methodologies using experimentation and investigation was seen as a significant challenge. The positive contributions of the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied as well as increased emphasis on practical work and on science, technology and society in promoting student centred active learning were noted in the study. My Department's £15 million initiative in the physical sciences includes the provision of in-service training for teachers and the enhancement of resources in post-primary schools. This investment will facilitate the smooth introduction of the new syllabi and will increase the level of practical laboratory work in schools.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking study report also addressed teacher recruitment and retention, stressing the need for a highly qualified and committed teaching profession. The need for ongoing training and support of teachers, especially in the areas of the physical sciences and mathematics, was highlighted in the report.</P>
    <P>The report also noted that Ireland is unusual in retaining externally examined, summative assessment for national certification and accountability at the end of compulsory schooling at junior certificate. This observation is timely in light of the current discussions in relation to the assessment at junior cycle level. The lack of practical assessment in the sciences at leaving certificate level was noted. Some work has already been done in examining models of practical assessment by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and officials of my Department.</P>

      <P>I am aware that managerial authorities of primary schools in certain areas are experiencing difficulties in obtaining the services of qualified teachers. However, a range of measures have been introduced to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-9 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998 all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration in the Association Montessori International College, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained at <Col N="422" /> St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration which is recognised by the NCEA. are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any difficulties in relation to the recruitment or retention of teachers in second level schools. If the Deputy has any particular area or school in mind, I will have the matter looked into if he supplies me with the relevant details.</P>

The summary report of this study was furnished in November 1998.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the study several steps have been taken to tackle the weaknesses identified in it. The most significant of these has been the extension of a remedial teaching service to all primary and second level schools. As a result there are now 1,465 remedial teachers allocated to primary schools and 560 full-time teacher equivalents to second level schools.</P>
      <P>The national reading initiative launched in January is a national effort to tackle the problem of poor reading achievements and to promote reading generally. The initiative acknowledges that the problem of low achievement and under-achievement is not just a school based problem. It stresses the importance of parents encouraging their children, by reading to them to develop their vocabulary and imagination and by listening to them read.</P>
      <P>In addition, revised guidelines on learning support/remedial teaching will be issued to all primary schools this year. Teachers will receive training in the implementation of these guidelines.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social, personal and health education is a new subject which is included for the very first time in the recently revised primary school curriculum. It is designed to be delivered in three ways &ndash; through the attitudes, values and practices conveyed in a positive school climate and atmosphere, through integration with other subject areas in a cross-curricular approach and through dedicated curricular time. It is recommended that a minimum of half-an-hour a week would be dedicated to teaching SPHE. Among the aims of the SPHE programme are (1) to promote the personal development and wellbeing of the child and (2) to enable the child to make informed decisions and choices about the social, personal and health dimensions of life both now and in the future. Pupils are taught to be aware of and to respect the various cultural, religious, ethnic or other groups that exist in their communities. They are also taught self-protection and safety skills such as identifying and avoiding situations and people who make them feel threatened and accepting an increasing degree of responsibility for their own safety and wellbeing as they get older. They are encouraged to be assertive, to know when to seek help and to confide in people whom they consider to be trustworthy such as their parents and teachers.</P>
      <P>At second level, civic, social and political education prepares students for active participatory citizenship. The syllabus is based on a number of central concepts which collectively inform and clarify the concept of citizenship. These include democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity and law. The syllabus helps students to develop their ability to explore, analyse and evaluate. It enables students to become skilled and practised in moral and critical appraisal and capable of making decisions and judgments, based on human rights and social responsibilities. In its methodology and assessment procedures there is a significant bias towards the application of practical skills required for participatory citizenship. Thus, students are equipped to confront such issues as the work of groups who might seek to impose their beliefs on others by illegal means or through the use of undue pressure or duress.</P>
      <P>If certain extremist groups, cults, sects or religious movements seek to impose their beliefs on others by illegal means, undue pressure or duress they do not benefit from constitutional protection under Article 44 of the Constitution and may be prosecuted under the criminal code if their actions constitute an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 71 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>In their pre-budget submission, USI called for student grants to be brought in line with comparable social welfare payments. With 40% of third level students qualifying for maintenance grants, this demand would give rise to considerable cost, estimated by my Department to be in excess of £50 million per annum. In this regard, I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year. I also intend to continue the practice in recent years of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
      <P>This Government has introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year. Furthermore, the position of mature students in general and, independent mature students in particular, has also been addressed under the student support schemes. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>USI have called for the inclusion of part-time students within the student support schemes. In the 1996-7 academic year, there were almost 23,000 part-time students at third level. In this regard, the profile of part-time students considered by the steering committee on the future development of higher education, indicated that almost 90% of part-time students were in employment. In this context I would point out that, under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, as amended by section 7 of the Finance Act, 1997, tax relief is available, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals on these financial supports and I will <Col N="428" /> announce the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the fact that a recent conference was told that Ireland has the lowest participation in adult literacy and training in the western world; and the proposals, if any, he has for initiatives for local and community based learning.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the education sector for adult literacy increased from a base of £0.85 million in 1997, when the Government took office, to £7.825 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.8 million in the coming years in adult literacy, which will be supplemented by a £1 billion investment under a back to education initiative providing for an expansion of part-time Youthreach, PLC and VTOS options. This will become an important bridge from literacy tuition to certified learning options.</P>
      <P>The information given at the conference in question related to the international adult literacy survey of 12 countries conducted in 1995, and published in 1997, which provided a profile of the literacy skills of adults aged 16-64.</P>
      <P>With regard to adult education and training, the report states that, while the majority of the countries surveyed had a participation rate in education and training of around 40% for the 12 months preceding the survey, the rate in Ireland was low at 24%. The rates in Belgium and Poland were lower.</P>
      <P>Recent initiatives taken in the area of adult literacy include the following.</P>
      <P>(a) An adult literacy development fund was established to fund a range of pilot actions to test models and innovatory approaches which will inform future practice in this area. Since the fund was set up, the clients catered for have doubled to at least 10,000, flexibility and awareness and outreach approaches have been increased, referral networks have been strengthened and expanded, family literacy groups involving both adults and their children are running successfully, and a number of open learning centres are being piloted, along with literacy groups for migrant women, travellers, and programmes for the unemployed in co-operation with FÁS, the community employment scheme and the local employment services.</P>
      <P>(b) An expansion of investment in staff development, including national certified programmes offered on a modular in-service basis for tutors and literacy organisers, in co-operation with the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) and Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> (c) Literacy programmes over the radio were operated in Mayo and Tipperary on a pilot basis. Discussions with RTE are ongoing with a view to mainstreaming.</P>
    <P>(d) The use of television as a medium in literacy awareness promotion and literacy tuition has also been explored. Work on a series of 12 half-hour TV programmes has commenced with a view towards broadcasting at the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>(e) An interdepartmental group on literacy for the unemployed has been established to develop an integrated response to addressing the literacy needs of the unemployed by jointly developing measures in consultation with the appropriate statutory agencies and expert groups. The group has submitted an interim report to Government. Its work is continuing.</P>

      <P>The 38 area based partnerships involve a wide geographical spread including key disadvantaged areas. Each partnership established training and education sub-committees as specified in the Operational Programme for Urban and Rural Development 1994-99. The role of these committees is to identify how partnerships can best support education and training provision at local level in conjunction with mainstream providers as appropriate. The partnerships have flexible budgets through which these supports can be aided financially.</P>
      <P>My Department contributes to the planning work of the education and training committees through my nominated representatives who are drawn from the Department's inspectorate and educational psychological services. In addition, each partnership has the services of an education co-ordinator, 12 full-time and 26 part-time posts, which are funded by my Department. These co-ordinators, supported by a national co-ordinator based in area development management, assist in the identification and promotion of suitable initiatives, support cohesion of education initiatives within the partnerships and promote integration with community groups and agencies.</P>

      <P>In general, students are eligible for grant assistance towards maintenance and fees (up to the maximum fee limit) where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either mature students dependent on parents or independent mature students. A mature student dependent on parents is defined to mean a mature candidate who was ordinarily resident with her or his parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Maintenance grants may be paid to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>Any revision in the terms of the scheme, as outlined, would have to be considered in the light of available financial resources and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality of the transition year programme can vary from one school to another. This is to be expected as each school is responsible for the choice of curriculum. The programme guidelines issued by my Department set the broad parameters within which transition year programmes operate. These guidelines allow schools considerable freedom. This freedom offers schools the necessary opportunity to devise creative curricula and learning experiences for their pupils.</P>
      <P>A major evaluation of the transition year programme was carried out by the inspectorate of my Department in 146 schools offering the programme in 1996. This showed that most schools offering the programme used this freedom responsibly and creatively. Under the heading &ldquo;quality of teaching and learning&rdquo;, 55% of schools evaluated scored &ldquo;creditable&rdquo; or &ldquo;distinctive&rdquo;. Weaknesses emerged, however, in the areas of assessment of pupils' work, where 19% of schools evaluated were considered to be weak, and evaluation of the programme by the school, where 25% of schools needed to do more work.</P>
      <P>My Department has followed through on the recommendations issued to schools as part of the report on the 1996 evaluation in a variety of ways.</P>
      <P>Support work in schools by the transition year curriculum support service has been intensified in the areas diagnosed as weak.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme has been evaluated on an ongoing basis by the inspectorate. Since September 1998, 30 transition year programmes have been inspected. These evaluations included interviews with the principal and the transition year co-ordinator, examination of the school's written programme and observation of teachers at work in classrooms. Individual reports, including recommendations on areas perceived as weak, have issued to the schools evaluated. Where necessary, the inspector has remained in contact with the school to ensure that recommendations are followed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circular M1/00, recently issued to schools, seeks to firm up schools' practice in the implementation of the transition year programme under the following headings: the need for each school to produce an annual, written transition year programme; the need for each school to ensure that all transition year students complete a full school year; the need for schools to devise curricula specific to the programme and not to <Col N="432" /> treat the year as year one of a three year leaving certificate programme; the advisability for schools of making full use of the transition year curriculum support service and of reading the service's publications for schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>In the pre-budget submission made by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, they called for substantial investment by the State in on-campus student accommodation and they acknowledged the provisions of section 50 of the Finance Act 1999 in relation to student housing.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the serious supply pressure which exists on student accommodation. Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999 was introduced specifically to relieve some of the pressure by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector. Properties qualifying for relief under the scheme are campus areas of the educational institution, or areas within an 8 kilometre radius of the main campus, which are approved by the educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place.</P>
      <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students and, therefore, there are no plans to intervene further at this stage.</P>

      <P>Specific instructions and suggestions for the implementation of the profiles are contained in the manual.

A committee called the <Col N="434" /> Tallaght schools attendance initiative committee has been formed. Two visiting teachers for travellers have been involved in the initiative. These, while employed by my Department, are not Department officials. One of the visiting teachers acts as chairperson of the committee.</P>
      <P>The work of the visiting teachers for travellers involves contact with schools, traveller families and other relevant bodies such as this committee. Similar attendance committees are in operation in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I believe that such local co-operative initiatives can be very effective in improving school attendance.</P>

      <P>The Education Act, 1998 allows for different parts of the Act to be commenced at different times. Any sections not commenced by 23 December next will automatically come into effect on that date. My Department's priority is to facilitate a planned and structured implementation of all the provisions of the Act. Two commencement orders have been made to date covering 51 of the Act's 59 sections.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Act was commenced on 23 December last and work is currently under way in my Department on drawing up the grievance and other procedures referred to. At primary level, consultations have been initiated with the education partners and it is expected that existing procedures will be updated before the commencement of the next school year. A similar consultation process will also be necessary in relation to second-level and this will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>Section 29 allows for certain decisions made by a school to be appealed to the Secretary General of my Department. Planning work has commenced in relation to the structures and procedures necessary to implement this section. The necessary commencement order will then be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Articles 28 and 29 of the UN convention on the rights of the child are given full effect in this State and have been for a number of years. The articles are complementary to the provisions of the Constitution, in particular Article 42 which relates to education, and to the recently enacted Education Act, 1998. The aims and objective of the articles will be given further statutory support by the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 which is currently being debated by the Select Committee on Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 28 of the convention relates to the right to education and the State's duty to ensure free compulsory primary education; the encouragement of different forms of secondary education accessible to every child and accessibility to third level education for all. Article 42 of the Constitution obliges the State to provide for free primary education. For many years now the State has fulfilled this constitutional obligation through the public funding of a wide network of primary schools. At the level of the individual family the School Attendance Acts impose a statutory obligation on parents to ensure that their children attend a national or other suitable school. It is recognised that the system established by the School Attendance Acts is not as effective as we would wish in ensuring that all children attend school, or otherwise receive at least a minimum education. The Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, proposes significant reform to this system. The Bill in particular proposes to provide for a comprehensive, national system for ensuring that children of compulsory school-going age attend school. The provisions of the Bill will be implemented by a dedicated national authority, the National Educational Welfare Board, and by <Col N="436" /> educational welfare officers appointed by the board at school level.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides funding and supports to a wide variety of post-primary schools which operate in accordance with their particular ethos and traditions.</P>
    <P>In general the Education Act, 1998 provides further statutory underpinning for the education system. It specifically provides that one of its primary objectives is to give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children to education. The Act, in setting out the duties and responsibilities of the Minister for Education and Science, schools and teachers gives further statutory support to the rights of students and their parents at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
    <P>Access to higher education, which is also addressed in Article 28 of the convention, is facilitated by significant public spending at all levels of higher education, by the fact that most undergraduate students in the sector have free access to courses and by the payment of maintenance grants to those students who need such support.</P>
    <P>Ireland promotes and encourages international co-operation on education issues at a number of levels, as is also required by Article 28 of the convention. This is done at EU level with our EU partner states, multi-lateral co-operation with international bodies such as UNESCO and OECD, bilateral relations with individual states, such as US-Ireland, East-West relations with Great Britain and North-South relations with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Article 29 of the convention relates to the aims of education in respect of the personal, mental and physical development of children, preparing them for adult life and fostering in them respect for their parents, their culture and the culture of others. I am satisfied that through the school's curriculum the resources provided to schools and the quality and dedication of the teachers in schools, the education system plays its part fully in helping children grow into responsible adults, capable of taking their place in civil society and making their contribution to the maintenance of a democratic society based on principles of equality and respect for others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to follow the practice in recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. The reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year were increased by 4.6%, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March <Col N="437" /> 1997 to March 1998. The increase in the reckonable income limits was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.</P>
      <P>This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I would point out to the Deputy that over 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government's priority in relation to student support has been to fulfil the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. This commitment has been honoured through the introduction of a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
      <P>The position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular has also been addressed under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. My officials are developing proposals for my consideration in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>In March 1999, my Department formally requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey of 196 schools in the south-east to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. The intention of my Department in conducting the sample survey was to obtain information on the likely scale and extent of the presence of asbestos in school buildings nationwide. The initial survey was completed in July 1999 by a firm of specialist <Col N="439" /> consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works. It identified an asbestos presence in some form or another in 59 of the 196 schools surveyed, i.e. about 30%.</P>
      <P>Although generally speaking the condition of the material was found to be good and posed no immediate health risk, its removal where possible was recommended and a programme of works was commenced immediately with funding made available from my Department. Remediation work has now been completed in most of the 59 schools identified in the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey has since been extended to all schools nationwide, primary and post-primary, and the management authorities and principals of every school were informed of this in December 1999.</P>
      <P>In view of the specialist nature of the survey and the fact that approximately 4,000 buildings are involved, it is difficult to give an exact timescale for the completion of the work. However, at the moment the timescale envisaged is three years.</P>
      <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by my Department and the Office of Public Works. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. The necessary level of funding will continue to be allocated to the programme as a priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1998 a major initiative for integrated education for children with special needs was launched. This initiative provided the first ever automatic supports for many children with disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures extend right across the entire spectrum of special needs and deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings. The key measures in the initiative included the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational <Col N="440" /> needs and the introduction of a formalised system of child care support for all children with special needs, including those in special schools, special classes and ordinary schools, who have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
    <P>The level of response in each case has regard to the number of children and the severity of the disabilities involved. Where a group of special needs children attend an ordinary school or adjacent schools, the support may take the form of full-time resource or child care posts or both. Where individual or small groups of children are involved, the support may take the form of part-time teaching hours or part-time child care support or both. The level of support has regard to the number of children and their particular assessed needs.</P>
    <P>Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 642 special needs assistants to support children with special needs in the primary system.</P>
    <P>Since September 1999 the remedial service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was announced some months ago that, with effect from the beginning of the current school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education.</P>
    <P>The actual entitlement of an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils qualify for the allocation of a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 qualify for the allocation of 0.5 of a post.</P>
    <P>The total allocation to second level schools in respect of remedial teaching in the current school year is of the order of 560 wholetime teacher equivalents.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that children with special needs will receive the support they require to fully participate in the educational system and reach their potential.</P>

      <P>Youthreach is targeted at young people aged 15 to 18 who left school with either minimal or no qualifications, generally those who attained less than five Ds at junior cycle level. Following the mid-term review of EU Structural Funds in 1998, a major expansion of places under Youth<Col N="441" /> reach was agreed, increasing provision in FÁS and the vocational education committees from 4525 to 7162 places. The expansion was designed to address a critical shortfall in places and to increase opportunities for participants to progress to further education and training after the foundation stage of the programme. It was complemented by the provision for the first time of a guidance, counselling and psychological service measure, and by child care provision within the VEC sector.</P>
      <P>This expansion happened side by side with a dramatic improvement in the economy and a rapid fall in overall unemployment. As a result, providers are having difficulty in filling places, and are faced with a seepage from Youthreach into employment as job opportunities increase. I am satisfied, based on the feedback from centres, that there is no need at present for an increase in Youthreach full-time places nationally.</P>
      <P>However, it is intended that under the back to education initiative set out in the national development plan there will be an expansion of part-time education options under VTOS, Youthreach and PLC programmes, particularly aimed at those with less than upper secondary education. This will also enable existing full-time places to be re-deployed to part-time mode where appropriate. A major focus of this initiative will facilitate part-time and more flexible options within Youthreach so as to enable those who leave the programme mid way to enter employment to continue their education on a part time basis to gain qualifications. This will also enable education, employment and family responsibilities to be combined, and help Youthreach to cater more effectively for lone parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 94 states have signed the statute and, of these, seven have ratified it.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Accordingly, considerable resources were made available to ensure that Ireland was represented at and participated in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the statute. Ireland continues to be represented at the preparatory commission set up after the Rome conference to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date to signal our strong political support <Col N="443" /> for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group, which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ratification process, the statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 articles. A careful and detailed examination of the Statute by the Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this matter is also being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the surveys, if any, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out in 1998 and 1999 similar to the 1997 survey, Effective Tax Rates for High Earning Individuals; the plans, if any, for further such studies in 2000; his views on whether this would be worthwhile; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Revenue carried out a survey of effective tax rates, that is the final tax bill as a percentage of gross income, paid by high earning individuals in 1997. That survey revealed that, while the vast majority of high earners did pay very substantial amounts of income tax, some were able to reduce their effective tax rates to very low levels. It was clear from the 1997 survey that the open-ended availability of capital allowances for passive investment in certain tax-favoured buildings, such as hotels and buildings located in tax designated areas, was a prime factor in contributing to the low effective rates in these cases. Accordingly, I acted in the budget of that year to close off these shelters for individual <Col N="446" /> investors in the case of hotels and to cap them at £25,000 in the case of buildings in tax designated areas.</P>
      <P>While the Revenue Commissioners have not conducted a similar survey since the 1997 exercise, they monitor the use of various tax incentives on an ongoing basis, both as regards the cost of those incentives and the categories of persons, including high earners, who use them. Revenue also monitor tax returns for evidence of avoidance schemes, which tend to be availed of by high earners.</P>
      <P>Indeed, as a result of information provided by Revenue in this regard, I acted in this year's Finance Bill to close off further schemes involving passive investment through general partnerships which benefited mainly high income individuals.</P>
      <P>Revenue have no plans at this stage for conducting a further survey of high earners, along the lines of the 1997 exercise, during the year 2000. However, they will continue to monitor closely the position of high earners and will consider whether another survey should be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that share options which are given to a person who is employed as a PAYE worker are chargeable to tax under Schedule E for the year of assessment in which the gain is realised.</P>
      <P>The charging provisions are contained in section 128 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The charge to tax is the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of exercise of the option and the price paid for the shares by the employee. The person is charged to tax at their marginal rate.</P>
      <P>Section 27 of this year's Finance Bill proposes that the tax charge normally due on the exercise of the option may, as a result of this section, be deferred until the shares are actually sold or within seven years whichever is the earlier. This will apply to all options exercised on or after the 6 April 2000.</P>
      <P>An individual in receipt of share options must return details of the gain to his or her inspector of taxes, who will calculate the tax due.</P>
      <P>The company who issues the share options of its employees is obliged to deliver details of the options to the inspector of taxes within 30 days of the end of the tax year.</P>

      <P>The health boards currently provide over 60 high support-special care places for non-offending children in need of special care or protection. Plans are under way to develop additional places nationally as follows. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan, commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will come on stream in the summer of this year. Planning of a 24 bed high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at an advanced stage. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. The Midland Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. A site has been acquired and a project manager and a project group has been put in place to develop the proposal. Places being developed in the other boards are as follows. Some 20 high support places and a special care facility with 5 places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; three high support places in the South-Eastern Health Board and five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a special care facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> My Department has conveyed approval to proceed with all of these developments and has provided the required funding.</P>
    <P>The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department, which was established in October 1998, continues to meet at regular intervals to monitor the overall development of these services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I announced recently that a new interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection is being set up. This new body will advise the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on co-ordinating the delivery of services and on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities and in those facilities run by or under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science for offending children. The special residential services board provided for in Part 11 of the Children Bill, 1999, will take over the interim body's responsibilities when the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>The provision of chiropody services in the north Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The board has advised that a chiropody service, funded by it, is provided at various centres throughout north Cork. The position with regard to the service in Mallow is that it was decided some weeks ago that the particular location was not suitable for proper patient care and, as a result, arrangements are being made to obtain an alternative premises. This is taking longer than expected. However, the board has indicated that it hopes to have the service re-introduced in Mallow within two weeks. In the meantime, patients requiring attention are being given the option of obtaining the service at other centres.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to ban blood donors who have spent six months or more the United Kingdom during the BSE epidemics in view of the decision made by Canada, the United States and Singapore and the fact that a survey of Irish donors indicated that approximately 80% had visited the UK between 1980 and 1999 and 13% had been there for six months or more.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The question of deferring different categories of blood donors from donating blood is a matter for the Blood Transfusion Service Board. I understand that detailed research on variant CJD, vCJD, is currently being carried out internationally, and the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the CJD advisory group are closely monitoring this research. There is no proven or even probable instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products, but the theoretical possibility associated with vCJD cannot be excluded at this time. There is currently no screening test to detect the presence of vCJD. For my part, I will ensure that the BTSB has adequate resources to introduce proven new technologies in this area.</P>
      <P>Experimental animal models suggest that the infectivity of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include vCJD, may be associated with white blood cells in animal systems. White blood cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters. This process is called leucodepletion, and the BTSB, as a precautionary measure, in order to minimise the theoretical risk of transmission, introduced leucodepletion for cellular products in 1999.</P>
      <P>The BTSB's policy is to permanently defer potential donors who may be at risk of carrying CJD, including donors who have received a dura mater transplant, human pituitary derived growth hormone or have one or more blood relatives with CJD.</P>
      <P>The countries referred to by the Deputy recommend that potential blood donors who spent a total of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996 be permanently deferred from donating blood. As part of the decision-making process, the countries in question assessed the likely effect of such decisions on their blood procurement policies. I understand that the effects for those countries are significantly lower than the effect would be on the Irish blood supply under such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of risk between maintaining an adequate blood supply and minimising a theoretical risk has to be considered in the decision-making process and care must be taken to ensure that <Col N="452" /> any precautionary measure proposed will not impact adversely on the donation, safety and supply of blood necessary to meet patients' needs. Furthermore, the populations of Ireland and other European countries differ from those of countries such as North America in the extent of their exposure to UK bovine-derived material. Therefore, measures to defer donors who have spent time in the United Kingdom may reduce donor supply without enhancing safety. European countries are actively evaluating this matter at present.</P>

      <P>In July of last year the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, launched the cardiovascular health strategy group report, Building Healthier Hearts. It showed that our premature death rate from coronary heart disease for men is twice the EU average that our death rates for women are also twice the EU average. The report is very comprehensive and its recommendations are far reaching. My Department has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. This strategy document is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner. While it is felt that it will take five years to implement the 211 recommendations, £12 million has been made available in 2000 to fund the cardiovascular health strategy. This additional funding will be the foundation for the implementation process of some of the more immediate recommendations across the health services. Progress will be achieved this year in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care, and in the area of audit and evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which ensures that only competent and properly qualified medical staff can work in this country. A doctor is not allowed to practise medicine without being registered in Ireland by the Medical Council. The council was established under the <Col N="453" /> Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, and registers doctors who qualify from Irish medical schools. It also registers doctors who have been educated and trained in other jurisdictions before they can practise medicine in Ireland. The Medical Council has authority to register doctors from other EU member states who have rights to practise here under EU freedom of movement directives. I know that the council works closely with registration bodies in other jurisdictions, including the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Once properly registered, a doctor is entitled to practise here. For those doctors seeking employment in the public hospital system, as for any other prospective employee, it is the responsibility of employing authorities to check references and previous employment histories of candidates prior to employing them. Specifically, in relation to hospital consultants, the Department has issued a circular to all employing authorities on the need to ensure that these matters are in order prior to consultants taking up duty on either a permanent or locum basis.</P>
      <P>The Local Appointments Commission processes a number of senior medical posts on behalf of the health service employers. Its procedures for hospital consultant posts place the requirement on each candidate to supply three references in advance of the interview stage. For other posts, where the volume of applications would make this procedure prohibitive, the commission carries out these checks on the successful candidate or candidates in advance of making a final recommendation to the employer. Both the Local Appointments Commission and the health service employers agency consider it good recruitment practice to obtain references from new appointees and continue to promulgate this practice among health service employers.</P>

      <P>The value of the scheme as an effective tool for channelling child income support is reflected in the very substantial investment which the Government has made in the scheme, most notably the full-year extra investment of £106 million provided for in this year's budget. This investment will bring the rates of payment up to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children with effect from September of this year and will bring the total full year provision for child benefit to £575 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance to June 1999 when her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for and not genuinely seeking full-time work. She had failed to submit any documentary evidence to support her claim and no appeal was made in this case nor has she made any application for unemployment benefit-assistance since that time.</P>
      <P>Claims to benefit and assistance are determined by deciding officers and appeals officers, who are statutory officers, and I have no power to interfere with their decisions. The person concerned could have pursued her case by way of appeal or could have made a subsequent fresh claim but she has not done so.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the information submitted by the Deputy, however, I am arranging for the local office to contact the person concerned with a view to clarifying her situation and to see what assistance can be provided to her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1998, my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this development, special dedicated provision is now made available for such children at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Each special class also has the support of a child care assistant. To-date, more than 50 special classes have been established to provide dedicated educational support for children with autism and my Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional special classes in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, parents of children with special needs, including children with autism, may wish their children to attend school on a fully integrated basis. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all such children now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs. The response in question may take the form of extra teacher or extra child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the individual <Col N="460" /> child. Already, as a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has grown from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 295 to 937.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of children with autism, there is also a need for additional support services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. These services are provided by the relevant health authorities and my Department works closely with these authorities to ensure that the necessary supports are made available.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of special support services made available by my Department offer an adequate response to the needs of children with autism and there are no plans at present to provide funding for individuals using the Lovaas programme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the excellent work being done with transition year students in the arts in transition programme which has been run as a pilot programme by the West Cork Arts Centre since September 1997. The idea of bringing in practising artists to schools to talk about their careers and give hands-on workshops is innovative and enriching for all concerned. I know that to date 500 pupils and their teachers have benefited from the visits of 90 professional artists. I am particularly happy to know that such projects are further enriching the teaching and learning of the arts at a time when they are being given a higher profile in our mainstream curricula at first and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The arts in transition programme is one of many worthwhile programmes and modules being run in the context of the transition year programme and the programme has run to date on private sponsorship. I would hope that it might continue to run on the same funding basis.</P>

Following indications of a problem with radon, the Radiological Protection Institution of Ireland &ndash; RPII &ndash; was commissioned to carry out a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools throughout the country; all schools received information on radon and are being kept informed of new developments; the results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow were issued to the schools concerned; the first survey indicated none of the rooms tested in 510 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200 &ndash; Bq/m3 &ndash; above which remedial action is advised; of the remaining 175 schools, the RPII advised that 13 schools showing the highest level of radon require attention as soon as possible.

This is expected to be ready shortly. The remaining eight schools will be inspected by the consultant in early March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 to 150, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with Waterford Institute of Technology to secure more detailed information in relation to the data and issues raised by the Deputy. I will have the matter fully examined when this information becomes available.</P>
      <P>Current policy in relation to third level educational provision is based on the recommendations of the steering committee on the future development of higher education. This committee was asked to advise on the future development of the higher education sector and to examine, within the overall national context, the needs for higher education on a regional basis and the appropriateness of the current institutional provision by region to meet these needs.</P>
      <P>As a response to the higher education needs of the south east region, the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. The report also recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other regional technical colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepted these recommendations with the result that provision in both the total number of places and in degree level courses in WIT is being expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. These measures, combined with the change of title of <Col N="466" /> the college to institute of technology, provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. This commitment to the development of the institute is being supported by a very significant increase in its budget allocation, which in the last four years was increased by 64% and amounted to almost £15 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>A unit cost system of allocating funds to the institutes of technology has not yet been developed. However, my Department has initiated a review with a view to preparing proposals for the allocation of current funding to the institutes based on the concept of unit costs or an alternative suitable formula based concept.</P>
    <P>The annual budget for each institute is at present allocated on the basis of its total pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of its annual programmes and budget submission which is required under section 13 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992. The allocation takes into account the complexity of each institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students (both full-time and part-time) and the nature of the infrastructure. Decisions on the allocations also have regard to government policy and the Department's priorities.</P>

      <P>A list of the schools in the Dublin 9 and 11 areas which are receiving special additional support by virtue of their disadvantaged status is attached.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. My Department is currently working with the educational research centre on finalising a range of indicators which will form the basis for a questionnaire to be sent to all primary schools. The purpose of this questionnaire will be to identify levels of educational disadvantage among pupils and schools across the primary system.</P>
      <P>I will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage within the primary system. The work which my Department is currently finalising on the proposed questionnaire will allow for an accurate identification of the pupils in question. I expect this work to be completed very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the levels of need identified through the indicators, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to <Col N="467" /> enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
    <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>
